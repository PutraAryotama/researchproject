Suic-1,I give up,"I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m tired of being tired and I’m tired of having to multitask between the loudness of my head, my anxiety, being in pain all the time from SH working a full time job that I get bullied at but shoe no emotion. I’m just tired and I can’t go on like this. Knowing my shit is incurable makes it worse bc what’s the point then if it’s never going to get better. My behaviours are getting out of hand and I can’t stop them but professionals say otherwise. My episodes are more frequent and my impulsivity it’s too much and detrimental. I can’t anymore.

Suic-3,Tired of fighting this battle.,I hope im ok to post as ive posted so often on other forums but im feeling very desperate lately. Im just so tired of fighting. I left a job i was in for many years last year. I have since had some part time work that didnt work out. Im lonely and going broke. I was desperate and called triple o last week only to be left to my own devices again. I may be going into a facility called parc a non acute inpatient service but that thought scares me. I dont know how much more i can endure.

Suic-4,It here again,My depression is severe todayAdded to this is the loss of my girlfriendShe was my sole purpose in my lifeNow im back to suicide researchas I really dont want to live anymoreI have nothing to look forward to in this life and I feel too old to start over again.Death would be a welcome giftI know there is no purpose in suffering all the time and its madness to do soLast time I tried to end it I got so close to doing itI always felt it was upsetting I didnt succeed and today I regret trying to get better because there is no getting better.If people could understand what its like living like this then maybe they would understand me better.I try to be grateful for the last 8 years I had with girlfriend and the purpose it gave me but it doesnt stop the added grief ontop of my depression.The cavalry are not coming to save me and thats whats changed for me.I cant keep living for the sake of others wanting me to live.,Scared,Community Member,12-12-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,71,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/it-here-again/td-p/604225
Suic-5,Reaching the inevitable end,"I am safe and currently not at risk. I'm 38, married and have a 2 year old son. Since I was 12 I've had depression. There's been periods it's been severe and overwhelming and there's been others where it's in the background. But at all times it's been there. It seems recently it's taken full control of my thoughts and actions. The last few weeks I've been on autopilot just to get through the days. It's starting the effect my job and family and people are starting to notice. I'm finding it difficult to engage in social events without becoming noticeably melancholy and detached. Last night I came to closest I've been in over 10 years. I got right up to the line but backed out. I didn't feel anything during the preparation. At the last second I felt fear and shame, that stopped me. Afterwards I felt a mild sense of euphoria and dissociation. I don't know how I'm going to move forward without my depression negatively effecting (or ruining) my work and social life. I'm worried if it keeps going like this I'll step over the line and ruin my family. I don't have active thoughts of self harm nor do I have a plan. But I am having a dark episode.",O_J,Community Member,27-06-2025,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/reaching-the-inevitable-end/td-p/611762

Life keeps on kicking me (don’t tell me other people are worse off because I don’t care) I’m tired of having to restart- I followed ALL THE RULES! Why am I being punished for being wrong?

Suic-7,Parents ignoring issues,"Hi all.I'm a teenage girl with a sister not very far apart in age from me. Between the last 2/3 years I've really been struggling with my mental health. I saw a therapist for a while who immediately told my parents that I had depression after our first few sessions. I know this because she told me and asked what I'd like to do in terms of the future with this. She offered anti-depressants and I told her that if these would help, I'd like to go on them, however, my parents strongly opposed and refused to talk to me about it. All I know is that my Mum doesn't believe in medication and my Dad completely doesn't really believe in mental health. He definitely has his own issues which he refuses to see a therapist for. However, around halfway through last year my sister began struggling with her mental health. I could see all the signs which I saw happening to myself and I really tried to help her. She was irritable all the time and cared a lot less about life. I found sh tools in her room which I threw out without telling her I found. (I was also and still do sh) When my parents found out about her struggling with her mental health, they promptly took her to a therapist who gave her medication. After this I was finding myself really irritated by this situation because when I was going through the same thing, they didn't intervene and I suffered in silence. I was better for a few months where I was clean from sh. Then my sister started struggling and it reminded me how my mental health was neglected. Then I fell back into the pit with no guidance. I can tell that my Dad at least favors my sister over me because she's always been sportier and more aligned to his interests. Whenever I talk to my Dad, it always turns into a lecture of some sort. We went on a holiday for a month and my mental health took a steep decline. I was constantly arguing with my family for things my sister would do which I'd get blamed for. There was point where I was really struggling and critiqued constantly by my family for being lazy. I'm just so angry about this situation. I feel so neglected and as though my family doesn't care about me or love me as much as my sister. Does anyone have any guidance?",_01_01_,Community Member,20-06-2025,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/parents-ignoring-issues/td-p/611589
Suic-8,Please help,"My friends say I'm depressed and I try to deny it, but I'm starting to think they're right, because I think down on myself and have thought about ending it before.

Suic-9,I can't help it but feel helpless.,"During my time in highschool, I've always thought everything would go well. But of course it won't always go well. This year, I've been attending my classes and tried my hardest to study. Until, lightning just kept striking me every single day. My class isn't exactly the brightest... I've been experiencing situations which causes me to have low self-esteem, depression, lack of self-confidence, and refusing to do specific activities. That's what helplessness feels like, and it's caused by my classmates. Yes, of course I have reached for support to change classes. I've talked to 2 Dean Of Students/Assistant, emailed the principal, talked to my friends to support me, and my TG (tutor group/homeroom) teachers. However, none of them could help.. or were prioritising someone else. I've been crying more than usual at home and school and not wanting to go to my friends due to the fact I didn't want to seem attention-seeking. I thought of coping methods such as self-harm. Though, how is it even gonna solve my problems... No one's there to help anymore and I can only rely on nothing but share my thoughts here. I lack so much motivation for learning due to my classmates being real jerks. My ears would burst just listening to EVERY ONE OF THEIR VOICES because of how disruptive they are. Not to mention they manipulate the teachers and try to ""get along"" and ""bond"" with the teachers to get their soft side. Honestly, I can't even learn at this school anymore. My school doesn't permit racism, yet it does at the same time!? I hate this, why do I meet harder paths unintentionally? Nothing's fair.. nothing's justified... nothing can help me fix all these problems. No one helps me. I don't think anyone I know is willing to... why am I living this unjustified life? I've failed to get a grip, failed to become better... That was my goal too... I've even failed my goal, failed to learn easier, failed to stand up for myself, failed to get help...",ThoughtsGetToMe,Community Member,20-06-2025,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-can-t-help-it-but-feel-helpless/td-p/611393
Suic-10,Does anyone else wish they were dead but it isn't an option ?,"For lots of reasons I don't want to be alive. I basically feel like the abortion that should have happened. The problem for me is that I have 2 adult children and 3furbabies that mean killing myself is not an option. I was a teenage mother who spent my 20s and some of my 30s counting down the days until my youngest turned 20 and I could end my life. I would research and consider different ways. Anyway, when I was in my late 30s I met someone whose Mum committed suicide when they were 30 and it completely destroyed them. It was in that moment I realised, I was stuck having to live. This means that everyone sighs in relief because of my protective factors in safety planning- but it does nothing to resolve this pain and stickiness I feel because I want to end my life but can't because of the love I have for my children. The need to torture myself through life then ruin the chances for my kids. I would love to know if anyone has ever felt like this? I would just love to not feel so alone whilst I persevere in having to wake up every morning, and create some hope for life being worth living.",Beanne,Community Member,27-05-2025,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/does-anyone-else-wish-they-were-dead-but-it-isn-t-an-option/td-p/610784
Suic-11,Where to from here?,"I grew up with the end goal of never living past 27, and now I am almost 31 and that scares me. I never made plans, never anticipated living this long. I moved from one country to another in hopes I could find a drive, make a plan, find a life, but it’s been a lonely existence here. Making friends - genuine friends - is hard in another country. My sense of humour is dark, my many different jobs have also been dark, and I find myself more alone than I’ve ever been. I find it hard to connect with people when the things I have seen makes me not want to waste time on superficial conversation. I just wish I could make a deep and meaningful connection. I wish I could just put the rose-tinted glasses back on and pretend that my life isn’t mundane, or for nothing. I wake up, I go to work where I sit on my own for eight hours a day, I go home and sleep - repeat. I try to get past my fear of people by going to local events, but frankly I’m so scared. People leave, and I stay where I am. I feel I am just existing. I have nothing to show for my life. No career goals, debt, friends that are in another country with their own lives to lead, people who left when they garnered something better. I am alone, utterly alone. I wasn’t meant to live this long, the constant reminder on my brain as I get closer and closer to my birthday, another year wasted. What do I do here? I am in a foreign country and I can’t keep doing this. I need help, direction - something, anything.

Suic-13,Just another human who's had enough of life,"I'm not sure why I'm writing this. Like everything else in my life, it seems pointless. I'm posting my nonsense on a random website so that complete strangers will acknowledge and empathise with me. Nobody close to me has. Not that I've really opened up about it. How the hell do you do that? I've pretty much decided that I've had enough of my life and it's time to leave it. I imagine those close to me being a little shocked and maybe saddened but not completely surprised that I ended my life, then carrying on like nothing happened. In time I'll be a distant memory, like an old injury. I feel tired, heavy like a burden, a waste of space, useless. Seriously, what's the point in drifting through days and nights filled with conflict, misery and feelings of hopelessness? If I went away, those around me would be free to enjoy their lives without the darkness that I bring. This is from my favourite song: ""As my anger shouts at my own self-doubt, so a sadness creeps into my dreams.

I currently live alone and bought my new house which I should be excited for in late December last year. But I haven't had 1 day of actually happiness in 6 months due to health complications which keep seeming to go on and on with no answers. I had major surgery called SOD. Since a week after recovering I developed massive stomach cramps which have continued since then. I've only had 1 week of relief from this. I've had multiple ""diagnosis"" such as fecal impaction, reaction to a 5 year drug, IBS and Pelvic Floor Dysfunction. However nothing has been worked and It's getting to much. Im struggling to work or enjoy life, even living on my own im noticing ""I've just had enough"". (I've been wearing the same cloths for over a week). I have one last hope this week with a blood test for SIBO. But if that all comes back clean. This is just too much. This cramp and me constantly feeling fatigued is to much.

Suic-16,I feel broken,"I'm really sorry for such a long text but I don't know who to talk to about this at all. I don't have some sort of serious medical issue or diagnosed problems. I'm quite young and on the outside, it would seem like I have a great life. But I have suicidal and self-harm thoughts. I know I'm too much of a coward to actually do it, but sometimes,. I sometimes just break down and cry, but only quietly and when I'm alone. I'm not under a lot of school pressure, but I always feel a weight on my shoulders. I do dance, and I feel pressured by my mother (whom I asked for help) to be better and try harder. I know I asked her for help first, but I can't take it. My knees are bruised and painful, my shoulder is red, and my heart just can't take it. It sounds shallow. Simple. Petty. But I can't. My work isn't be appreciated. My effort isn't being acknowledged. I'm constantly being told 'you're not even trying that hard' whenever I try to be vulnerable or explain myself. It's right. I'm not trying as hard as I know I could be. But I'm still trying. Spending hours. Until I'm dizzy. Until I hear something crack. And I wake up in pain every day, but keep going. I'm burnt out. It's not just that. Sometimes, I sit in a dark room alone for hours, feeling utterly empty and broken and wanting to end everything for no reason. Every bad thing that happened to me feels like a dream. A nightmare. I don't even have that big of a problem in life. People are out suffering worse. People are dying. And I'm here crying because I'm tired. I need to pull myself together. But I can't. I just want to let myself go and let my mind shatter into a million pieces. I'm so tired. I'm so broken.

Suic-30,venting,"i was diagnosed with depression when i was 15. it was a tough time. i was bullied at the new school I moved to, and my friends from my old school suddenly all turned on me and spread false rumours. i always kind of knew they were fake friends, but I stayed because I had nowhere else to go. the new school was hell on earth. the suicidal thoughts became all I thought about and I couldn't stomach down food, and I couldn't stop crying. i skipped class and ignored my grades. a semester later, I transferred to another school, because I wanted a fresh start. I'm currently there right now. i have friends, and no one actively, openly hates me like at my other two schools. but Ive lost all motivation. i cry at night wondering when it will get better. i don't know what the purpose of this all is. this one girl from my first school posts photos of me online and laughs at me with her friends at the train station when I just want to go home. my parents don't believe in mental health and I've reached out before, but they made it clear I wasn't going to get professional help.

Suic-32,Heavy Heart...,"Last week I had a very scary experience with my son who started screaming at myself and my daughter. He thought we were arguing and was triggered. He had a driving lesson this week that didn't go well and again had a screaming fit. Poor kid was an innocent bystander to watching his big sister go through severe bullying through senior school. His own needs as a child growing up were second to myself and his mum having to devote most of our attention to his sister to survive. It was awful and I knowing what I know now would have pulled her out of the education system that is clearly broken. Their lack of support and action supports perpetrators and not victims. No accountability for parents and consequences for the kids. Anyhow, they have damaged both of my kids as a result. Time doesn't heal wounds. My own innocent kids had to deal with changing schools 3 times, restraining orders on 12, 13 year old girls for what? Because their own negligent parents didn't have the decency to rain in their own kids behaviour when they were being awful to a young girl for no reason. Very sad! As a father who is struggling to navigate his own life it is not easy. My son is lost. I can see it in his eyes. He has so much rage and anger I am genuinely concerned about what may happen. He is a ticking time bomb. Selfishly as an adult I now regret having children knowing I don't have the mental fortitude to help them navigate all the unnecessary BS that life these days is delivering.

I am a good man. But since then I have struggled with both anxiety and depression on pills prescribed by the doc and I’m seeing a psychiatrist as already said but it doesn’t change anything i feel pain everyday my day is wake upfeel painworkfeel painwork more because child support doesn’t care and I’m paying a huge amount more than I shouldhave kids - because I have them 50%and then I feel like a beerand one always turns into manynow I’m an alcoholic that is seeking support for that A more money I have my kids literally 50% but I still pay $340 a week child support On top of that - i pay all of their sports, my eldest (I have 3) doeshigh end sport so that alone is >$5k a year, plus her other one and then the second girl does 3 things and the you youngest boy does a couple things (trying not to be too specific just in case) no one cares as long as mum is ok, everyone is ok. and then my eldest says “mum can’t afford our lunch orders this week” on a Friday it is about $10 each for a Lunch order. Meanwhile she just got new sunglasses worth $300. Tattoos, you name or.the system doesn’t care i always try to do the right thing “mum must just be going through a hard time” but she does cash on the side plus Centrelink payments, plus she is still with the aforementioned man who has his own income. She was supposed to keep them on private health but then when the first big op came up no, we had to spend double (which I pay half) because she had taken them off without my knowledge because she “couldn’t afford it” In the meantime she had a tummy tuck and god knows what else because she wanted to look better. the system doesn’t care about the kids and definitely not the person who makes money, they just feed the person who makes the least. Great job Australia. im just about done with it all the only thing holding me here is my 3 amazing children who are innocent and I would never let know this drama. guess the only reason I’m here is god I hope someone has had the same experience and made it through and can me some guidance. there isn’t any more ‘medical’ prescribed things I can be doing.",WhereDoIBegin,Community Member,30-12-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/no-one-actually-cares/td-p/604875

Suic-40,Emptiness taints everything,"My external life looks great- friends, family, meaningful employment (albeit more difficult recently), sense of community, financial and housing security. But, life feels too big and too small at the same time. I feel like an empty shell, a person who is made up of a gaping pit of nothing, void. I feel vague, like I am a step behind myself, disconnected and the world is foggy. I’ve had suicidal thoughts on/off for 12 years now, with past attempts. I thought I had recovered and I had 3 years of stability but recently the thoughts returned with a vengeance. The thoughts are protective, they distract me from the emptiness inside but in the end their protection leads to destruction. The thoughts come with the need to act in some form- research - plan- preparation: purchase and hoarding of materials- rehearsal of plan- etc. Unfortunately, the actions tend to escalate over time. Lately, I’m not allowed to go to bed without the house clean and all rubbish in the bin outside and clothes washed, just in-case I am not around in the morning. I don’t want my family having to wash my clothes or see the last food I have eaten. This is the stupid level of detail my brain makes me obsess over, and it becomes exhausting. Even when I have a good day and the thoughts are in the background, they come to the foreground at night, in the end the rules must be followed. I have engaged in therapy continuously for 4 years, and on/off for a total of 10 years- including group therapy programs. I’ve had two therapy appointments already this week because I wasn’t sure how I would survive to the next week- thankfully I think I will be relatively safe until my next appointment. The GP wants me to see a psychiatrist, but I really don’t think my issue is neurochemical so I don’t hold much hope that psychiatry will be able to assist. The suicidal thoughts are just a well worn neural pathway, they’ve become an impossible habit to break and I fear they are chronic. Am I the only one who creates a life worth living and yet still finds it impossible to live in it?",Sunrise,Community Member,09-01-2025,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,8,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/emptiness-taints-everything/td-p/605296
Suic-41,"When power is concentrated in the hands of the few, the actions of the many don't matter.","When I look at the world I see a terrible place that is getting worse. In particular, I have noticed that what power I do have to make positive change is being bulldozed by those who benefit from the world staying the same or getting worse. I am watching the planet slowly but surely breeze past climate targets to ensure the life is permanently going to be harder and worse. I see genocides happening whilst my government worries about appearing to be too biased against those with power. And what is worst of all, I see people who actively want to make the world a place hostile towards people because it makes their own lives slightly easier. It is tiring to see nothing but bad things happening and knowing I cannot do anything to change it. What is more frustrating is that no-one seems to understand my anger towards this matter. When I describe my feelings of being upset at seeing my world turn into a cesspit, people tell me to focus on the small things. I hear people say ""worry about yourself"", or ""small changes add up"" or other nonsense that does absolutely nothing to change the status quo. For every meaningful thing I do, there is another person undermining my actions because they don't want to give up anything to make the world better. I hate being on this planet. Seeing the backwardness. Being told to ignore what I cannot change, even though these things still affect me. I'm tired of knowing that no matter how much I try to make the world better, I will never be able to actually change anything. I don't want to have pain anymore. I don't want to have to deal with being powerless anymore. This world is hostile to me. There are 8 billion people with over 25 million dying everyday. 1,000 people might even know if I die.

Unfortunately I am on a multiple-month trip with my partner and cannot break up with them, despite my disposition. Besides that, I’ve been having less and less energy and feel so isolated from everything. I’m worried about sharing my concerns with others, as many of my thoughts just aren’t good and I don’t want to scar anyone with them. But I also can’t deal with all my worries alone right now. I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past and I’ve self harmed too. I am terrified of having those feelings again and try everything to stop them whenever I drift into a more negative headspace. I’ve worked on creating a safety net for times like this, but since I’m traveling I can’t spend time with friends and family and simply can’t talk to anyone in person.

Now, over a year later and I feel like I’m stuck in a cycle I don't know how to break. I still use this behavior to cope, even though I know it's not helping in the long run. It's become a way to feel something or punish myself for feeling empty or numb. I hate this feeling and I don't know how to stop.

My husband and I don’t have sex and the rare occasion that he “feels like it” is once a month if that. I’m starting to resent him and don’t feel like being around him a lot of the time because I don’t see any perks right now to being with him. I do all the house work, all my maternity leave pay goes towards our house we’re building so I don’t get to go do things like id want too.

Suic-57,"If I told my psychologist that I am suicidal, what can they do for me?","Hello everyone, I'm currently 21 years old and I have been dealing with depression for years now.It has progressively gotten worse over the past year to the point where I think about suicide almost daily and have made a plan as well as set a date. One day, I went to my GP to get a diagnosis where she gave me a Mental Health Treatment Plan and referred me to a psychologist. I have been debating for a few days now whether or not it is worth the psychologists time (or my money) to go see them if I know or feel positive that I may go through with my plan. My question is, what can my psychologist do for me in this regard? Will they send me to a psychiatrist where I could potentially become an inpatient? I find that I am not completely against the idea but another part of me is telling me that that will not help or stop me. Not to mention, psychiatrists are costly and I have read that they have quite length waiting times.

Suic-60,Problems with anger and rage,"Before i start off i would just like to mention that i am safe and my safe plan is listening to music or distracting myself with youtube. i also have a strong circle of close friends that i confide in, i trust them very much. i’ve noticed whenever i am extremely angry i tend to harm myself. i would also like to mention that i am not always angry like this. to put context behind this, whenever i have annoyances and irritations with my mum (and it always happens with my mum) i’m left alone in my room, extremely angry that she can’t agree with me on something. i figured that the reason im so in rage after having slight annoyances with my mum is due to feeling like i’m not in control, or that i’m not being heard out. i’m the youngest so i’m pretty used to not being listened to, but this is also my problem. i’m not getting given a chance to reason and i find myself having really bad rage. this leads to me harming myself. when i’m in rage like this i cry, and i don’t know why i self harm myself like this when im extremely angry. i thought maybe it’s because of my need to hit something but i don’t want to damage anything in the house. this also only every happens when i’m arguing with my mum, she’s been a very difficult person, she also has history of mental health issues. i know now that the only thing that puts me in a bad rage is my mum, but i’m struggling to figure out why i hit myself when angry and why i get so enraged over slight annoyances with her.

Suic-61,"Loneliness, PTSD & Suicidal Ideation","Hi, 2 weeks ago I had another phase of suicidal ideation. I'm not new to this, I've had attempts in the past, I've had 2 long psychosis episodes since 2020 with lots of hospital admissions. My psychosis/addiction even took me to prison. I battle with PTSD symptoms now, struggle to work, very low stress tolerance, flashbacks, depression, anxiety, etc. Thankfully I have my sanity back and didn't get stuck permanently in a false reality. My diagnosis is drug induced Schizoaffective disorder & PTSD. I used to be very involved in the community, socialised a lot, and helped my then wife to raise our kids. I was a great father. That was until my mental health took a rapid turn for the worst and I self medicated. Life 2 years on from my last episode is vastly different. Completely isolated and lonely. All the people I thought were friends disappeared. So now I struggle with connections. I don't have much faith in people, especially in a society that still stigmatises mental illness. So what do I do? I isolate. Over the years I've had help from professionals to focus on my interests and to help make connections in the community, but it triggers me and I battle with anxiety. I see people in the community I used to be friends with, they ignore me or I ignore them. I want nothing to do with them. I don't have a sense of purpose in life anymore for myself other than my kids. I focus a lot on my kids when I struggle with suicidal ideation, but when I'm really struggling I feel my kids will be better off without me. So, with social isolation/loneliness as well as living with mental illness, where does one fit into society again? My life for the past 5 years has been all about heavy mental illness stuff so I struggle with small talk. I've been abandoned by a lot of people due to my mental health, yet now that I'm level headed again how do I start the process of reintegration back into society, especially a small town community I was once a part of when half of me doesn't want to, given the past? If anyone has been lonely or has ideas/experience with finding purpose again, I'm all ears. At the end of the day I want to be here for my kids, I want to be the best father I can forthem.",C73,Community Member,25-11-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/loneliness-ptsd-amp-suicidal-ideation/td-p/603677
Suic-62,Self Injury Revisited,"Hi all. First let me start by saying I am okay. I have been putting off writing about this for weeks. The two main reasons are 1) I don't have any questions or seek advice. This makes it feel more like dumping my problems on someone than proactively engaging in conversation. That is not really my personality and makes me feel selfish. 2) I feel a lot of shame. After a lot of back-and-forth in my head, I decided to write about my recent experience. Despite my reservations, I think it's important to let go and not to hold my emotions in. Ideally this should happen with a councillor, but I can't wait until find a new councillor. I have a long history of untreated SI until five years ago. By some miracle I got it under control and have been free of hurting myself since. A month ago I was overwhelmed with emotion. My usual maladaptive tricks to manage my headspace failed to help. I felt the weight of all that heavy emotion I carried, lift away. I also felt SHAME. For the next week it felt like my emotional burdens were turned down. I had a clear head again. Of course this is a temporary fix, and a TERRIBLE way to make me feel better. A week later I shocked myself did it again. That set off alarm bells. I haven't done it since I recognised the warning signs. It speaks a lot to my mindset at the time. I am better now. But I have to find a better way to deal with these emotions that overwhelm me. I can acknowledge this is risky behaviour, that it's not a good coping mechanism, and that I need to work on it before I fall into the SI spiral again. I'm open to any advice, suggestions, coping strategies, etc. If you have read this far, thank you for taking the time to listen to me complain. It does feel better to let me express myself.

Suic-63,Confusing thoughts. (Delete if need be),"I'll make this part clear; I have not been having suicidal thoughts. In my mind I have never had thoughts about committing suicide. I've posted once or twice on different forums for help I guess I don't need since I can overreact. The question I need to ask however relates to a rephrasing of the term that I can't help but feel make people feel as if they're simply stuck when processing thoughts including myself... especially myself. Maybe it's too cryptic but the idea is this: Is your life worth living? Yes. I can't stress that through the day tomorrow and the day after that will bring you some peace. Your personal experience has value, meaning and purpose. I won't comment on this further since I have expressed that I have never felt suicidal feelings. The professionals on this site will put it in so many better words. I say it because it serves as a pre-context to what I find confusing and strange. Is living worth your life? Within this context, living relates to the broader context in which we as humans operate. Living feels inherently societal, communal, extrinsic - whereas life feels personal and intrinsic. It's confusing to me because when I ask myself ""is any living worth my life"" I say no. I want to explore, try new things, I don't believe that most if any path is worth the effort that people place into them. People should feel comfortable to change jobs when they want, meet new people (whether selfish or selfless) for support when they need that sort of support. In rain and shine, people find that they need different things at different times. But life rarely feels that open. It feels more siloed, walled off - not mutually inclusive but exclusive. And that frustrates me. As I said, maybe this is the wrong train of thought, or maybe this is an inappropriate forum to post this (Delete this if need be). Maybe I'm asking too much from the world - but I can't imagine how much my children, grandchildren and their children will be asked for from the world and then feel that where I am now and what I'm doing will be okay for them.",Yellow-Thorn78,Community Member,24-11-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/confusing-thoughts-delete-if-need-be/td-p/603646

Suic-69,"I am heartbroken, angry, conflicted.","Hi everyone (im ok)TW self harm/abortion rights/family issues/estrangement I am currently struggling with some urges that I havent had for years, not since I was suicidal years ago.In the light of recent political events and my own personal medical circumstances, the topic of abortion being healthcare came up at family dinner. Basically, I dont ever want children. I would be an awful parent I am not healed enough mentally, prepared physically or financially and am sure I would not want to bring a child into the world we live in today. I stated that for my own mental health and the sake of preserving my own life, I would not keep a pregnancy if I fell pregnant.I go to every length to prevent pregnancy and am extremely responsible with sex and contraception, but my parents, especially my mother, would see me as a murderer for choosing this for myself and my body. It breaks my heart that my mothers love is conditional to this.If it happened, I would have to keep it a secret and go through the traumatic process alone, or be honest with her and risk becoming disowned/estranged. I am conflicted with my feelings because she is a loving and caring mum in every other way, I wouldnt be here without her support in every other aspect of life and she has saved me many times, but when your confidence in unconditional love from your mum has been shaken for something like this, it is extremely conflicting and devestating. I am angry that she thinks this way, I am guilty that I feel this anger, because shes so supportive and loving in every other way, and I am so incredibly heartbroken. These feelings are so strong I feel pain in my heart, my urges to self harm are back to use as an outlet.I want to be self destructive to ease this pain and anger. I know I have options in my mental toolbelt to de-escelate these urges and feelings.Ive been in therapy for 6 years im not asking for advice on how to talk myself down, I wont act on these urges, but they are back which makes me realise how strongly I feel about this hurt. I guess I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else is going through similar. It feels stupid to feel this extremely on a hypothetical. But you never know when that hypothetical becomes a reality and knowing that I wouldnt have the love or support, so much so that it risks estrangement, it just crushes you.

Suic-72,Without Cause,"Hi, I've never put my story out for any to read or have thoughts on except my pyhcologist. I had a work place injury in August of 2022 that required surgery which I had in Feb 23. Between those two dates I started a new job and with the injury came a whole new world of not being able to do anything that I was doing and enjoying previously. I had hobbies like gym, pistol shooting and umpiring AFL not to mention all the household duties you preform without a moments thought. So I found myself in a hole and it was getting worse, I would go into the toilet at work sit there and just cry without reason (in my own mind anyway). This happened a couple of times and I didn't want to think to much about it, then it started happening everyday, then a couple of times a day to the point I couldn't go to work. So my doctor put me on anti depression medication and referred me to a phycologist. There I was diagnosed with adjustment disorder and severe depression, with no capacity to work my new employer let me go in the January of 23 which I couldn't blame them as I couldn't do the job they had hired me to do. I had surgery and was progressing really well until I went to host employer where I unfortunately over did it and re injured the shoulder. I was improving both mentally and physically until this point. The surgeon couldn't operate any further and recommended a shoulder joint replacement. That part of my w/cover claim ceased however I was still being treated for the mental health part as it is a secondary compaonant due to the initial injury. During that time until now I have had 2 episodes (that's what I call them) where I have found myself standing in front of all my pills as I take quite a lot of pills for pain and inflamation along with other drugs for migraine relief and prevention, shaking, crying, and wanting to end my life. I don't know how many other people have had this feeling where it's like the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other but that's how it felt like a big fight between the 2 and so far the angel has won. I have started a new job into my 4th week and I've had 6 days off with stomach issues (stress maybe) doctor has sent me for a lot of tests so not sure what it is yet. Deep down I think since it's been 2 years that I'm just struggling with the whole normality of life and with a few other family issues on top that I also don't know how to handle I'm starting to feel like that hole is opening up and swolling me.",Lostat51,Community Member,06-11-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/without-cause/td-p/602855

Suic-74,"I'm 13, and feeling like my world is collapsing.","I'm 13, and I do home-schooling. Me, and my mum, had a discussion about whether home-schooling would be better than normal school, because i was feeling depressed and suicidal in term 1 of this year. We agreed that it would be a good idea as my mum described it as a fun experience, due to the 'control' I'll have, and the 'activities' I can do. Fast forward to now. I've been doing home-schooling since term 2 this year, and at first It was fun. Me and my good friends were still very close as we live close to each other, and I'd still ride to school with them. Later though, during the term, I started to notice the amount of work I have to do, the lack of control I have, and the groups/activities were non-existent. This led me to questioning my mum about it, and, according to the website they were doing updates to it. I was told that they would be up soon. They are still down. The lack of freedom and people i have to communicate with, made it very hard to stay motivated to do my full-amount of school work. This inevitably led to me stressing, and struggling to make time to hang out with my friends, which have led to me feeling depressed, as this is my last year with them before they leave. I have expressed my emotions to my mum and dad, but I haven't made it exactly clear to them that I am feeling extremely depressed and suicidal. I recently re-lapsed into self harm again after almost an year without it, and I feel extremely disappointed in myself. I desperately want to tell my parents that I need help, but I'm too scared to.

So i started drinking more then the occasional time out with my friends. not everyday but every few, usually not enough to get me drunk but just something that can dull my head while i can fall asleep without worries. my parents keep spirits and gin in the top of our pantry and i've just been taking a huge mouthful at a time, ocassionally more then five. I hate to admit that i love they way it makes me feel so heavy and light at the same time and i keep finding myself more and more consumed by the thought of just having a drink to relax a bit. Alcohol abuse runs in my family. i've always been told i need to be careful and i definently am not at a point where i would consider myself an alcoholic, but i'm afraid im going down that road. i kept telling myself this is the last time and the last time, one where i drank quite a bit more then i would usually was almost two weeks ago and i havent since. but i still keep thinking about it and now i've made myself stop till after my second last exam, ive started self harming more regularly. drinking feels so easy, so invisible. but soon enough my parents will notice the near empty bottles in the cupboard. i dont want to end up where my fate and genetics are dragging me, but it feels so easy. i keep thinking a couple drinks on occassion is fine, and it is. but its the insentive around it that i know is wrong. in the evening, by myself, just to quiet my head and cope. i'm just moving from one unhealthy coping mechanism to another and i dont know how to stop it.",Guest_43109705,Community Member,30-10-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-didnt-think-i-would-be-back-here/td-p/602582

Suic-79,its getting more difficult,"Hi, never thought that I would next to post something in beyond blue or something similar but I think after almost 2 decades I’m at my breaking point finally. Im a male, grew up with the mantra that “boys don’t cry”, growing up I was bullied relentlessly, the type that never had friends not being able to talk to anyone about it, as the school would put the blame on me (yes the school put the blame on me) so some times the only option was self harm. During this time I became good at hiding my emotions and feelings and these days I have mastered it. When I left school something came out about a teacher. (Took me years to realise that I was in fact being groomed) as you can imagine depression and more self harm ensued. Fast forward a few years, scars heal and slowly feel better. A relationship opened my eyes up, that I don’t deal with emotion too well and I am truely a lonely person, even if there are other people around me. It’s like I don’t connect on the same way length as others. Rough breakup, leads to more mental issues + self harm. Move forward 6 or 7 years and things start to look better, get married and enjoy life a little bit. Join a volunteer Fire Brigade love every minute of it. Things move along nicely, but I started to keep a diary as I noticed in my self that I have high highs and the absolute lowest of lows and haven’t quit worked out if I’m bipolar or not yet. But move on to current day, I feel as though I am at my lowest possible low. I constantly feel numb, I feel out of place and I question my point of existence. I feel ignored and un-noticed and lonely, all of the time. I have days where they are really good then the emotions come crashing down and feel horribly low and it’s difficult to pick that back up. When I volunteer time to the brigade and local community, I feel great, working on a trail, I feel great. The moment I get in my car to go home that low hits hard. Im posting here because I feel ashamed to talk to anyone, I worry that if I talk a professional, I will get a label that will make me end up in some psych ward somewhere. It’s been a hot minute since I have self harmed, it’s defiantly been on my mind of late. They say that life starts in your 30’s but it feels like it’s ending.

I’ve been rejected by every graduate program I’ve applied for. I’m so worthless and I feel like I’ve lost all my intelligence. This was my last chance to do anything with my life.

Suic-81,struggling again.,"(I'M SAFE!) I'm just going to post a TW before getting into this, I know I'm posting this to the suicide and self-harm discussion but I just want people to have this as a trigger warning incase something I say is distressing, I never want to hurt anyone, so if this might be upsetting to you, maybe scroll past this. I'm posting this for the people who have viewed my account and seen my posts, but I'm also posting this for myself as I find it difficult to find someone I can talk to about all of this. Recently I have been really struggling with self harm and I was trying anything to stop myself from actually using something bad. But I guess the way I was trying to cope was doing more damage then good. I didn't consider what I was doing to actually be self harm but now thinking about it, it might have been. I was fine with what I was doing until I realized that it could be considered as hurting myself, instead of trying to cope. If anyone has seen my recent discussions, they would know the whole reason I stopped self harm was because I had a panic attack and told my mum about it. I didn't stop to try and get better, I stopped because I knew that if I did it again I would have to tell her, and I didn't want to break her heart again. But, I had another panic attack when I saw all the bruises and red scratches I had given myself by doing other things to myself. I told my mum and since then, I hadn't done anything. She's trying to get me as much help as she can but it's near impossible to actually get any sessions with a therapist around my area. I think the reason I'm coming on here is just to vent because I don't know what to do. I use a rubber band but it just never feels like enough. I want to know if what I was doing was actually self harm or if I can continue to use that as a coping mechanism. I still have really strong urges and I don't know how to control it anymore. I know it isn't healthy but are there any ways that I could help myself that actually would feel similar to self harm? Or is it just breathing exercises and mindfulness. Because I don't know how much longer I can cope like this. I don't know if I'm crazy and I wish I never started because I didn't realize how horrible this addiction would be. Can someone please respond with any coping mechanisms I could use, or if what I was doing was really wrong?",random,Community Member,13-10-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/struggling-again/td-p/601437
Suic-82,18year old trying to quit sh,"Hi, I’m new here, I’d like to start by letting everyone know I’m safe. I know this is the suicide and self-harm section, but I’d still like to include a TW just in case. I’m 18years old, and started self-harming when I was young. The first time it was out of anger and self-hatred. I didn’t realise then how addictive it would be. It’s now many years later and I still get overwhelming urges daily. I have tried many alternatives in the past in attempt to quit, including other unhealthy habits, but nothing comes close as a replacement. I’m currently 5 months clean, which is the longest I’ve ever been. I guess I’m posting here as I’m struggling to not talk about something that has such a large importance in my life. It’s a difficult subject, I can’t stand the look of disappointment or concern anytime I talk about it or someone sees my scars. Their whole tone changes and it makes me feel sick. I don’t like that something like sh has such control over me, but I feel like it might be me forever. I find nothing else feels as extreme. That maybe if I am in physical danger, people may recognise how bad the emotional and mental pain really is. At first it was strong emotions that triggered it, but now it’s on my mind all the time. I see it happening in my head, I remember the way it looks and feels. I don’t know what I actually want from this forum, maybe just support from people who get it?

I have always been the funny kid in my friend group, so when I'm struggling I tend to hide it under my humour or support my friends instead of looking after myself. I have been struggling for the last 3 years and I'm currently 9 months clean after a long six months of attempts and relapses and restricing my eating. I have been silently struggling by my self this whole time with occasional help from a friend who also struggles. I have felt so good for the last 9 months only having these thoughts maybe twice a month. Until recently where these terrible thoughts are now the only thing I'm thinking about. I'm not the smartest person ever and struggle at school with learning especially while having these episodes. But teachers tend to tell me I'm not doing enough which makes me contemplate why I'm even here. With my autism and adhd it makes it makes it really hard to regulate and I regularly have meltdowns due to being overstimulated which never helps in these situations.

Following a bout of major depression, I have anhedonia (avolition, but no anergia). I have energy to get things done that I see need doing. Nothing makes me feel good more than momentarily. Most pleasurable activities make me crave discomfort (or worse). My mood is generally flat and I do not feel much in the way of emotion (happy, sad, angry, jealous, etc..). I have nothing I want to achieve. I have nothing that I want to do. I have nowhere I want to go. I have no people I want to meet. Helping others does not make me feel good. Achieving things seems hollow. I have no fear of dying. I have no fear of pain (also a very high pain tolerance). About most things I truly do not care. I have an entire alphabet of mental health conditions diagnosis (ASD, CPTSD, OCD, BPD, MDD, PDD). I have had another alphabet worth of treatment (CBT, DBT, EMDR, ACT, Schema, TMS). Some are still ongoing. I have an upbringing of care for family and self sacrifice. I take care of myself so I can do things for family so they remain comfortable. Its all done by rote. I have been taught/trained over my treatments not to self harm. I often think about it... These thoughts do not worry or disturb me. I keep busy so I don't dwell on them. My family wants and needs me. I have been in constant mental health care over the past 4 years. I have been in hospital numerous times. I have been on (and am now off) antidepressants. I regularly see psychologists and a psychiatrist. I will ask my psychiatrist for another round of TMS next time we meet. I have a lot to be thankful for. I have more than a lot of people.

Suic-95,She showed me the scars,"Hello, my 14 yr old has been really depressed and self harming for about a year now. It has been a rough ride. A couple of months ago she became really suicidal and I think she even had a kind of an attempt. With the help of one of her friends and her psychologist she seems better now. In fact she says she has not self harmed for almost a month, the longest she has ever gone and she feels a bit better and can see with more clarity what she has done. From the outside she certainly seems better. I know suicidal people can seem better before they carry out a plan but I don’t think that’s where she is at and the psychologist agrees. As part of her feeling better and with summer coming, she has decided to show me her scars so that I can come to terms with them and she can have more freedom to where what she likes in summer. the scars are in her right arm. She is totally covered from shoulder to elbow and she has a few more between elbow and wrist. she told me not to react when I saw them and yet I did. It was just a very sad “oh Sweetpea” but of course I should not have said anything. She showed me the elbow to wrist yesterday (which I did not react to) then spent most of today crying about it and calling helplines about it while she was out. Little did I know how much worse the rest of her arm was. We talked about it but even though I initially said she could wear what she wanted, when I saw the severity of it I suggested sticking to short sleeves rather than sleeveless. She was hurt by that she told me later and she explained why which I sort of get but I also realise that those scars are obvious and the source unmistakable and I worry about her having to cope with questions or being seen differently by people (for years to come!) and I won’t lye, I worry about people judging me too, I know it is not about me but this is a factor too. I feel like enough if a failure already I can’t cope with any questions.and then there is her 8 yr old sister which I am desperate to shield from this. My teen agrees and she is not planning to wear anything that shows her scars around her sister.my questions are:1. Would like any insight anyone might have and how to help my teen stay on the recovery path (needless to say I am finding it hard to relax)2.

I recently experienced a traumatic death and have been diagnosed with Major Depression,Mixed Anxiety Disorder and PTSD. I have been having dark thoughts in the last couple of weeks and the right people do know about this.I have an anger tornado about my grief and I have a sadness tornado about my grief. Recently they started to merge and bad thoughts have been coming into my mind. Like I don’t know how I am possibly supposed to live out the rest of my life. Possibly 40 more years. How do I do it? Do I want to do it? Like it is now? What is keeping me here and exactly how much do I care about that? Would that be selfish of ME to contemplate my existence and what that would mean to be non existent?Why should I care if it is about me. Other people can take care of themselves. I mostly am exhausted. I don’t think I want to die. I think I just want all the intense emotions, energy and constantly have to fight/struggle every day to survive to just shut up. I would like to stop pretending. I am used to life kicking me down and dealing with heavy situations. This by far is the hardest and heaviest life event I have ever had to deal with,and the others have been pretty bad too. Life is just going to keep kicking me. That is how it has been for me.

Suic-100,"Self harm, eating disorder (bit of a ramble)","Hi everyone, hope you’re all well.Havent hit a ‘rock bottom’ in a few months, but this weekend has been particularly challenging. I find every weekend I get the ‘blues’ because I am quite isolated and have a lack of routine out of my weekdays. I haven’t self-harmed since starting antidepressants (in a few months) until the weekend which is when I know things are getting particularly bad. I have been crying so much that I’ve gotten headaches and my stomach was in physical pain. I ended up contacting a helpline and vomited during the phone call weirdly enough. I am curious to know if anyone would know why this might have happened? I am still young but would never think I would go through this much pain in my life at my age. When I am depressed, I find myself ruminating about all the ‘bad things’ that have happened to me and feel sorry for myself. I thought things were getting better but I end up back in the same cycle. I wish I just had a friend that I could talk to or hug. Someone that would tell me everything’s going to be okay. I wish I could tell my younger self that but I feel I would be lying. It’s also been hard for me to go out without criticising my appearance and feeling uncomfortable in my skin. And when I do, people, particularly men, have made me feel extremely uncomfortable or I even experience people yelling at me from their cars when I go for walks. I often see other girls who are extremely pretty and wish I was them. I feel like my life would be more simple if I was just ‘prettier’. I’ve spoken about this with my therapist as I am also recovering from an ED, but in recovery it’s extremely hard to go against society’s expectations as there is so much value placed on looks that we are made to believe it defines our worth. When you recover from an ED you have to unlearn that belief, which is challenging. Sometimes I think it would be easier to just give in and only be something people want to look at.Thank you for listening",Janey_beyond,Community Member,18-08-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/self-harm-eating-disorder-bit-of-a-ramble/td-p/597904
Suic-101,"I don't really see a point in living at all. Existential/nihilistic crisis, I guess?","I don't see any meaning in life and don't really want to live anymore. I've been questioning why I do anything at all since I was a young teenager. At some point, I think I came to the conclusion: ""I should live to make myself happy and/or make other people happy"" And that must have worked for a while... But now, I'm questioning: ""Why does happiness matter?"" After all, suspending any beliefs beyond the physical world, when one abstracts happiness to its basic components; is it not just ""The right neurons releasing the right neurotransmitters at the right time""? Why do I even exist in the first place? Being an atheist, I believe I came from a line of species that was most fit to survive in their environment at the time. I believe that line of species originates from some kind of primordial soup. In that primordial would have been a simpler form of life, such as bacteria: Cells without a brain, without will, ""alive"" because the metabolic reactions taking place in and around them sustain themselves. That's all I think they were, self-sustaining metabolic reactions. The result of the laws of chemistry just simply existing. This is what I believe I am. This makes me think there is no point in life and I'm just the result of natural selection after the laws of chemistry/physics. But, I'm not just some unembodied consciousness drifting in a void, I'm a human in a body, a brain: I have emotions. I still feel sadness and inevitably will, but I don't see a point in suffering through it. So, why not just die? I mean, there's totally more questions to be asked though, like: How/Why does this universe even exist in the first place? How/Why are physics and chemistry like that? If happiness can be abstracted to a bunch of chemicals (i.e. neurotransmitters) at the right place/time, what can the particles that make the atoms that make those chemicals be abstracted to? (I have no clue) Is there any meaning in the answers to these questions? On a more personal note: I began socially withdrawing 2 years ago, I started SHing about 4 months ago and I feel like I might allow myself to die if I can't see a reason to live or at the very least, feel motivated enough to live. I have people in my life who miss me and be affected by my death, so I'd like to avoid going through with that... But I guess, if I look at what I've been typing, It wouldn't really matter...

I've tried re engaging in old interests like computer programming. but it's no longer interesting for me. perhaps i just know it's too late what's the use.

I'm not wanted here and can't leave so i often find myself just planning to unlife myself. nothing to look forward to and nothing to bring to the table. why continue the misery. that's what i wonder. why continue... this has been my life since 25 so 20 years of isolation, sometimes i try and willc my heart to stop. i can't work because i need to sleep every 3 or 4 hours.",alone4eva,Community Member,16-08-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,5,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/unwanted-human/td-p/597818

I promised him i wouldn't do it again I had an argument with my mum this morning and she threatened to send me away to live with my dad and call the police and the hospital on me, ive never had an argument this bad before with my mum and i hurt myself again and I'm really scared he's not going to take it well. i feel so awful because it never used to be an issue since noone would see it, but now i have someone who does notice and i know by doing this I've directly hurt him and I dont know how he's gonna react, i really love him and i dont know what id do if i lost him because it feels like he's one of my only friends sometimes.",pyjamarama,Community Member,20-08-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-relapsed-and-i-m-terrified-of-losing-my-boyfriend/td-p/598025

I have tried to stop but I keep going back to it, even when nothings wrong I just find myself relapsing again. I always feel like I'm being overdramatic when it comes to my mental health and feel like I'm faking the whole thing. Earlier this year I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and had tried therapy but honestly it didn't help at all. I want to be able to tell my parents but they think that putting me in therapy solved all my issues and they are not people I feel comfortable sharing this with. As much as this is horrible a part of me wants to get worse and never recover. Is it normal to feel like this or am I just attention seeking? I've also many times found myself thinking about wanting to die but never having a plan. Like I have thought about most likely methods I would use but I never actively wanted to pursue any of them. Some were brief and some really strong. Last night i found myself having these thoughts in my dream. I don't want to die but I want to disappear. I have intrusive thoughts about hurting myself, but I don't know if its related. Am I even making any sense haha? there was a lot more that I wanted to say but I don't know how to put it into words.

Suic-110,Trying to overcome these feelings.,"I have had anxiety and depression since I was little, I am now 39. I go through stages that I like to call ""episodes"" where my depression and anxiety are quite back but I have always been able to get myself out of it and into a better headspace. That was until September last year. I have struggled with some losses in my life( I lost our cat and that loss consumes me heavily to this day), my husband and I are dealing with a really nasty family member, we lost some family members, we lost another fur baby 2 months ago, I used to be sooo close with my sister she is my best friend( but I feel like we aren't close anymore) and I have really been diagnosed with a health issue that is taking some time to adjust to.I usually love going to see my friends and going out, but the last few months all I want to do is hibernate at home with our cats. Of last I have these thought of ""What's my purpose in life""? I feel like no one really needs me. Which then has me thinking if I wasn't here although people would be sad at first, they would be ok in the end. My husband would have our cats and friends and in time could find someone else to spend his life with who has less issues, my parents have their new life in QLD with their close friends and my sister has her son and husband. I was without work for a few months and I recently got a job, which I thought would be great for my mental health and I would be able to help my husband financially, but I get such anxiety every day thinking about having to go into work. I can't sleep properly, I feel sick in my stomach, can't eat properly, end up with migraines. I feel like I'm not ready to face the world. I was hoping people could offer me some advice or techniques on how they get through this?!I used to have my own techniques and was able to overcome these feelings, but I feel I'm to far down and am struggling a bit this time round.",Neeky85,Community Member,05-08-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/trying-to-overcome-these-feelings/td-p/596922
Suic-111,Benign Fasciculation Disorder - Hopelessness,"Hi I'm Cindy and I am posting in here because I didn't know where else to post this. I am suffering from what I believe is Benign Fasciculation Disorder. It is an unknown disorder with what looks to be no treatment or no recovery (it will either go away, or it won't). It's a 'harmless' disorder that consists of twitching of the muscles 24/7. It might not be considered harmful but it is mentally draining, annoying and prevents me from sleeping at night with non-stop twitching. I've had this for 7 weeks now, insidious onset. No idea why it started. Doctors can't help me. I've had blood tests and my blood levels are fine. I am not Magnesium or other minerals deficient. They don't think it's MS or ALS. They say I'm 100% healthy. Doctors perscribe muscle relaxants to 'stop' the twitching at night but I'd rather not take them as they cause addiction, depression and other unwanted side affects. I have no idea if Anxiety, physical activity, stress etc causes it or if it just 'does it'. Some days it lets me sleep at night, other times it doesn't. I live day to day in fear of whether or not I'm going to get a good night's sleep. If I feel a twitch I panic. If I don't get a good nights sleep my mental health drops. I become hopeless and have thoughts of suicide. Hopelessness being ""well no-one knows what it is, no-one can cure me, I might be like this forever. No one knows, no-one can relate, there's no hope, what's the point?"" I'm trying Physio at the moment but even the Physio can only guess. I'm doing all these exercises which I think are not helping. They are just causing twitching in other areas of my body that I didn't have before. Now I have back discomfort from it. Yes it stopped a bunch of twitching in the knee area of my thigh, but now other areas of the same thigh are twitching. I'm here to find out if there are others with this condition and if so, what do you do at night to help you sleep through the twitching? I can deal with it throughout the day but not at night.

Suic-112,Comorbid mental health,Hi. Ive never done anything like this but here goes. Looking for people with similar experiences that maybe have Bipolar and Dissociative identity disorder.. Ive got a long list of diagnosis and have been medicated for a bit over a year. sometimes I forget to take my medication. just one of those things. Despite the medication I am far from cured. Due to having many conflicting issues it is difficult to treat. I can see when im spiralling and when things are getting bad. My issue is reaching out for help. No-one understands or can relate. Im just looking for someone who may have spiralled down into their depressive state. Dissociated and have hurt themselves as a result. maybe im a little scared as I have never been in this state before and scared of myself. Logically I know that it wasn't something that I should've done however the other me was stronger at that time. And I was just a paralysed bystander watching while other me was in control. I don't often dissociate to this degree.

Suic-113,Recovered and enjoying life,"Hello all It was been more than 2 years since I attempted to take my own life and I thought I'd drop by to let you know that I have fully recovered and am enjoying life again. In May 2022, following my attempt, I was diagnosed with caregiver burnout. My adult son, who has autism, ADHD, intellectual disability and Bipolar II was still living at home. He is now in supported NDIS accommodation, and I am really enjoying having the freedom to do what I want, when I want. I had also been looking after my elderly parents. Mum had been thrown into psychotic depression from the Covid Lockdowns here in Melbourne and was a hospital admission. Dad had undiagnosed mild Alzheimer's and i hate to think how hard it was for Mum looking after him on her own. Long story short being a sandwich carer was just too much. Mum went into care in late 2021 and Dad followed soon after. I was falling into a carer role with Mum and ultimately, it's what did me in. My brother has taken on the carer role, and I am now able to just be her daughter. Dad, sadly, passed away a few weeks ago but he was 89 and it was peaceful, so I'm ok. I did all my grieving during 2021 while supporting him at home while Mum was in hospital. Bottom line, I accepted help and counselling following by a few months of therapy with a senior psychologist helped me enormously. I made a full recovery and got on with my life. Such help is vital if we are to recover from such a profound experience. Today I find it hard to imagine that I ever felt that bad. But I did.

Suic-114,Disability and Depression,"Hi everyone, I'm 17, I was born with a disability (a hand and arm difference that all in all affects me very little physically in life), I went on exchange last year to France, I am an academic student who is about to commence VCE and aiming for a high ATAR to get into law, science, commerce, global studies or whatever else, and I just feel like I don't have the right to live. Despite my privilege (growing up in a wealthy area with stable food, housing and education), I struggle to find jobs and experience due to my disability (even though I am perfectly capable of performing the job even without adjustments), some teachers speak to me as though I'm stupider than my classmates and don't treat me like a functioning human. I can't shake this feeling that I am less of a human than others and that I was just born wrong. Teachers treat me like a burden when I want equality and I have been told that I can just miss out because of my disability. I feel like a failed genetic mutation, and I worry about putting any potential future children through the same thing as me. I had to have surgery to ""fix"" me as an infant and I really just feel like I shouldn't exist. I would be in an asylum a few hundred years ago, and I wouldn't survive natural selection. I feel like my life is a burden to others who are abled bodied because it's sometimes treated as one, especially when I don't conform with standards and speak up. I don't want to die but I feel as though my teachers and strangers sometimes believe I should and sometimes believe my parents would be happier or better off if I was just normal.

It would be great to have a legal team as part of it to help get your affairs in order so as not to leave a mess for loved ones when they least can cope with all the rig mer roll that comes with death.

Suic-123,How to support my friend,"My friend attempted suicide about a month ago, he is thankfully ok and I have seen and spoke to him numerous times since. At the time I was obviously very distraught and I don’t know that I acted in the most helpful manner. I texted him saying that I’m here if he wants someone to listen and talk to but also if he wants space or anything. He has spoken to me in the past about things and again I’ve seen him since and everything. I just don’t know how to navigate the situation and how to properly be there for him. Like he’s told me he’s doing better and seems to be looking forward to things but also idk whether he just doesn’t want to actually tell me. It’s really scary because when he did it I didn’t see it coming, like I had talked to him that day and he seemed normal so it’s difficult to know. It just so hard not to think I’m not doing enough and that I didn’t do enough before. I want to be able to support him in anyway he feels comfortable with and I’ve told him that but idk. So I need advice on what to do because I really don’t know and I’m scared I’m not doing enough to be there for him, but like idk he might not even want my help.",Sal2645,Community Member,16-06-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/how-to-support-my-friend/td-p/593558

I’m not gonna do and how much I’ve done for Guy but I’ve done a lot but what is broken? Even more? Is the fact that he’s protecting all these people and all these other social platforms like Reddit etc. And bagging me over 12 months to get a stroke of ego and for people to feel sorry for him and made me out to be this evil monster which he was the one I’m working he’s just operating around the gym for 12 hours talking to women and plan to leave me but yet he wants a baby with me spent thousands over $70,000 freezing my eggs and everything for Ivf Then I caught him out. Then he rushed me to get married. Wipe me off. My feet made out. It was his idea but then went onto Reddit that night and complained that he didn’t wanna get married that I forced him to just say his ex would see all this and make me out to be a monster . He tried to suicide many times. He’s been aggressive since we got married. I know it’s because he’s fucked up and he doesn’t wanna get caught out. I’ve got all her details all his details. I’ve given him lots of chances a safe place to explain to me why he denies it and makes it I’m going crazy . I’m angry with the fact that why did he marry me if he wants to be with her he says he’s in love with me. I’ve been through so much garbage in my life and if I tell anybody all of my friends and my family wants to bash him up or two, they will tell me to sell them. I know I have to leave, but it’s getting the strength emotionally to leave His life out of his way to find someone to screw them to justify himself. I’m embarrassed. I trusted someone and finally let them into my life treated like garbage for no reason. I’m starting to hate him but I just wanna know why he can’t just tell me the trace so I can move on And why did he marry me cheating on me because he talk to everybody? He has all of his exes everywhere and he had violent charges on him. I’ve helped him so much. I thought I was and spoiling and I think holidays money cleaning up. I just can’t be bothered doing any of it. It’s like I’m just surviving , out of my way to watch porn and criticise but I was doing not knowing that it was out of my comfort zone and the fact that I was doing it to him he couldn’t take the time to even do that. Very selfish person. Know these things but I guess I just wanna know Shall I just leave and let him figure out but I just can’t talk to him again we’ve been through a lot and a few deaths and he told me basically he’s only me because his whole family will just say that he stuffed up if he lost me and he’d be jealous of someone else had me like this.

Suic-129,"I feel worthless, I'm tragic, without direction and don't have a reason to live anymore.","I was bullied in numerous ways during high school and hated everyone there. I have no fond memories of what should ideally be my teens and some memorable younger years for most people I guess. I was unhappy until 23 because I stayed in touch with toxic acquaintances who thought they were better and gave constant opinions and judgment. I did terrible suicide destructive mistakes because I wanted to dumbly die, since I had no financial support to drive, I had no direction for suitable jobs and any opportunities regardless from my pathetic job recruiters. I never wanted apprenticeships, construction or University, wasn't eligible regardless or the personality to study. I also had a infatuation with a girl that died and I got really upset since she was uniquely overly attractive in a way that I put her on a pedestal, she was my favourite obsession and I just went insane during that time to not care about living and became un appreciative with my life, despite loving my brother and mum, I wasn't thinking of them during that phase of my life. It caused me to be mistakenly diagnosed with Schizophrenia or having psychotic history. In 2017 at 22 I became diagnosed tragically with pre diabetes due to detrimental pharmaceuticals. I than had my gallbladder removed in 2020 three years shortly after which is even worse. Before this I overcame weight gain, I've even got some stretch marks. I have the bullshit compliance of having to continuously get scripts from my doctors and than go monthly to the chemist and buy un wanted meds with my limited pension income. I can't even mention about any spiritual beliefs but it's just make my life worse, with all the unwanted remarks and I can't even think internally or have private thoughts since their connected. Constantly told I'm not intelligent, different and there's gossip occurring. When I was going for my driving lessons. I had many issues that I didn't want to deal with and I ended up having my original O.T. therapist discriminate me, after she ignored me for one year to say I wouldn't achieve my licence, she discouraged me to keep trying, wither I should not spend my money on continuing. Given no support jus pension. I've never had suitable friends who had my best interest and shared relatable hobbies. I'm still a virgin since I can't get my life in a ideal standard with full time work, a mortgage and even social confidence since I've been bullied and had so much trauma or suffering since 2008 that got worse in 2012 onwards.",Jaibigrone907,Community Member,02-06-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-feel-worthless-i-m-tragic-without-direction-and-don-t-have-a/td-p/592587

I've hated him ever since I was little, It started with him trying to make me follow his AFL football team, or he would be overbearing and verbal to my mother. He only understands himself, His selfish, arrogant, un caring, ignorant about many things. He can be devious and talk behind your back if he wants to, because if things are kept secret he won't have a guilty conscious. He prevents me from having valid feelings and problems and sais I'm on holidays because I'm un employed. He wants a house of peace and doesn't let me talk to my mother if his bothered about the volume of his T.V. His told my mother that I shouldn't be driving and that I don't want to work. All during high school my father was complaining to him about school feels and that I was taking days off and his friend was saying to pull me out of the only ideal private high school I could go to.

Suic-145,Steps- Survive Change Recover Reflect Avoid,"In my experience steps post an attempt are almost set in stone. My attempt in 1996 and several episodes that clearly were not attempts but were approaching them, all had these steps as a process, so lets look at them. Someone's first true attempt at taking their own life is a harrowing occasion, it's a time when logic is removed. SURVIVE To think about survival during this period is to have logic remaining as part of your thoughts so that is asking a lot in these circumstances. However, in future attempts (or thoughts) the presence of logic might be there if you realise that you need to think that way. We are talking prevention so we need to find ways to prevent going down to the attempt stage. CHANGE (your environment) During an experience whereby I was approaching an attempt and obviously very upset I knew I needed help. So as I always suggest- change ones environment, I walked and headed towards our local GP surgery where I told the receptionist ""I need help""... and got it immediately. You might need to change your accommodation, partner status... anything to avoid the direction you were travelling down. RECOVER Time is a master but time cannot be rushed. It could be a grief period you are going through and we all know that it takes time to process that and there is no answer to that except forced distraction like a sport, hobby, company of others, therapy groups and so on. Those activities keep you grounded to your normal life activities that keep reminding you what life was like before the spiral. Emotional trauma isnt a nice place to exist so within us is the survivor that really doesnt want to be there. Forcing yourself to break through from that distraught place is needed. Get up and walk... do anything! Walk around the block, stare at the bees, smile at a stranger... anything. REFLECT Once recovery is in progress you'll feel better and this is where you can look back on those days/weeks/months where you know you were at risk. You know it wasnt a place you'll want to repeat and it is only you that can prevent that. Reflecting is a natural way of recovering the same as animals reflect upon a conflict with another dangerous animal. It is not unhealthy to reflect. AVOID 28 years on I still avoid going down that path to an attempt. I dont talk about the actual act, its too traumatic. However the positive is that I know my limits and I know the process I force myself to carry out as in the steps above Avoidance is the roadblock.

And those people will never ever understand suffering like I do. My whole life has been suffering. I was abused at a very young age by my dad and it's impacted my life forever. Every day I have panic attacks and am just sad. All I do is sit here and listen to 100 gecs or death grips while dissociating. I'm not built for a capitalist world where human life is thrown to the side in the eternal chase for higher and higher profits. I truly have been having more and more suicidal ideations and it's terrible. Nothing truly interests me. Any sort of job would just drive me insane. Sorry that this post is just a ramble lol i'm just putting every thought that comes into my head down onto the keyboard.,MeepMorp,Community Member,28-04-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,5,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/everything-s-too-much-and-i-don-t-know-what-to-do/td-p/590234
Suic-147,Do you have a safety plan?,"Safety planning involves creating a structured plan – ideally with support from your health professional or someone you trust – that you work through when you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts, feelings, distress or crisis. Your safety plan starts with things you can do by yourself, such as thinking about your reasons to live and distracting yourself with enjoyable activities. It then moves on to coping strategies and people you can contact for support – your friends, family and health professionals. The safety planning model was developed in the US by suicide prevention experts Barbara Stanley and Gregory Brown. It has been used extensively by US veterans’ health organisations, hospital emergency departments and high schools, and there is strong evidence that it works. Many health professionals in Australia also use some form of safety planning to support clients experiencing suicidal thoughts or feelings, or after a suicide attempt. beyondblue has an app you can use to create a safety plan, called BeyondNow. The BeyondNow app takes the principles of safety planning and makes it even easier to use – so rather than carrying around a piece of paper, you’ve got it on your phone at all times. It’s free to download from the Apple Store or Google Play. If you don’t have a smartphone or would prefer to use your desktop or laptop, BeyondNow is also available to use on our website. Do you have a safety plan? Do you have questions around how you might create one, or fill out some of the sections? This thread is for discussing ideas around creating a safety plan, and sharing tips about what has been most useful about this process for you. Below are two videos featuring Peter and Nic, who have both used safety plans successfully.

Suic-148,"Chronic suicidal thoughts, does it get better?","Hi all, I am new here. After suffering several childhood trauma, I have developed complex PTSD, recurring depressions and chronic suicidal thoughts.I have been living with chronic suicidal thoughts for the past 30 years. Almost every day the thoughts are on my mind; background thoughts if it is a good day, forefront of my mind on a bad day.I am seeing a psychologist and I am on antidepressants but the thoughts are still there. My psychologist reckons they will never go away.Can I imagine to one day live a ""normal life"" ( i.e., not feeling worthless and hopeless all the time) even with chronic suicidal thoughts?",BKL,Community Member,04-04-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,17,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/chronic-suicidal-thoughts-does-it-get-better/td-p/588479
Suic-149,addicted to suicidal thoughts?,"I’m not sure how to word this, but I feel like I’m ‘addicted’ to having suicidal thoughts? Now, to preface this, I’m very satisfied with my life and acknowledge that I’m very privileged. I’m also not actually suicidal; it would realistically hurt too much and I don’t want to traumatise my family. Since I was about 12 or 13 though I always thought about how much better it would be if I could die, and now it’s just constant to a point where I don’t stop thinking about killing myself unless I’m absorbed or distracted by doing something. Again, I don’t really want to die, but I can’t stop wishing I don’t have to wake up the next day. Being unconscious is probably the most peace I feel. It feels like as the days pass on, my doom is nearing, as dramatic as that sounds. The only reason I’ve been able to make it thus far is because I’m so privileged and because I’ve been blessed to have people who I can depend on and who still put up with me. But I know that I can’t depend on others forever, and of course I’m trying to be independent, but god am I so incompetent at everything I do and I don’t have a good personality either. I’m not kind, charismatic or optimistic; I’m terribly selfish, introverted and pessimistic, and I can’t even do ‘basic’ things other people can do like… hold a conversation. I don’t really go outside unless it’s necessary (eg grocery shopping, school) because I get really anxious about having attention on me, and it’s so sad because I want to spend time with my friends, but it’s a massive hurdle to overcome every time and never gets easier than the last. I have a similar-ish problem with my self harm too, where it’s just there. I’ve started it a while ago too, but nowadays, I don’t really do it because I’m super hurt or sad or anything (that would be a bit too often) but it’s just there and I’ll just do it if I feel like it. Of course I never hurt myself too much, so maybe that’s why, but it comes as easily as writing or drawing, and I can never bring myself to care that much about it like everyone else does. (Not that I am trying to justify it; I would be very concerned if anyone I knew, or anyone at all, was self-harming, no matter the degree. And it does make me really sad to accidentally see it online, even when I try to avoid it) So, I really don’t want to come off as insensitive, but I can’t stop wishing that I won’t have to wake up the next day.",ebee,Community Member,17-04-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/addicted-to-suicidal-thoughts/td-p/589434

Suic-159,By best friend thinks I’m a bitch,"By best friend thinks I’m a bitch. It hurts because I thought she knew me better, she knows everything about me, family issues, depression, etc. I’ve always expressed my love for her, to make it known that I appreciate her, yet one day she just started excluding me to hang out with this other girl, this other girl’s really nice and I hold no resentment towards her nor to my best friend, because people grow apart. I knew I still wanted her in my life, but I also knew I had to stop diluting myself into thinking that I was her best friend anymore, so I distanced myself, got closer to other people. She started acting weird so I reached out and asked if everything was okay, it wasn’t, she was mad at me. I asked why and she said I was being a bitch toward her, I explained my feelings and she boiled it down to “you can’t act like that because I’m not choosing you enough” that hurt. To have all your feelings boiled down to something seemingly so petty, it made me question myself, was I being a bitch? Am I overreacting? It’s still hard to answer those because I love her and empathise with her point of view. She told me she needed a break from our friendship. That hurt as well. Thinking back on all those memories, it seemed like she threw it away so easily. She hasn’t spoken to me since, I respect her boundaries and haven’t engaged in any conversation either. But part of me is mad, so so SO mad, mad that she excluded me then had the audacity to call us a trio (a trio where 2 people hang out on a weekend and never invite the third apparently), I just wanted some empathy and understanding from her. I love her of course but part of me wishes she’d falls down the stairs or something. I feel like absolute shit, I’ve started self harming again, I called lifeline for the first time ever because I had no one else to turn too. The worst part is I feel like a bad person, whether I was being a bitch or not I feel like one for wishing bad things on her.

Suic-161,Bipolar Disorder Low's Causing Dark Thoughts,"Hi and thank you to anyone who is reading this. I am 26 and I suffer from Bipolar 2. I was diagnosed almost 3 years ago and I don't cope any better now than I did back then. I am definitely self aware now and no where near as reckless and chaotic when I am in my highs but none have been as crazy as before I was diagnosed and medicated. My lows however are just as bad as they were the first time. I feel and think the worst and find it really hard to stay positive and I guess look for the light at the end of the tunnel. The thought of passing away is more ideal than it is scary. The best way to explain it would be that I dont care if I died. I know thats not the right way to feel but its so hard not to think that way and just know that it would stop all the pain and just crappy feeling. I struggle to let out how bad I am mentally because I dont want the people around me to look after me anymore than they already do (Mum, Friends and Girlfriend). I visit my therapist pretty much fortnightly which is a big help but even her I cant tell her how much I think negative thoughts. I am embarrassed that I do feel this way. I message lifeline in the night sometimes to just kind of let it all out when I cant which I do feel helps a bit and because I dont know who is on the other end I dont feel bad for putting all my stuff onto somebody else. I guess this is kinda what I am doing here. so thank you so much to anyone who does read this. I just really need help as to how to completly open up to my therapist and the ones who care about me and tell them how bad I really am doing. I just need help and feel helpless.

Suic-163,Relying on Pain,"Just to be clear I don't intend to leave the planet any time soon and I'm confident that I will stay that way. I am what happens when someone completely and utterly gives up, but stays. I was pushed past the limit nearly a decade ago. I've never attempted to shuffle off this mortal coil, but it's not because I wanted to stay. I don't believe in an afterlife. I know that the time here is all I have, and I'll have it all, but everything hurts. Plus, when I feel like the world wants me gone, staying is how I spite the world. I had depression for 8 years. I'm 24. My mum, brother and sister physically attacked me, constantly, until my early teenage years. I was the youngest sibling. The violence only stopped when I grew big enough that attacking me was now dangerous if I chose to retaliate. And I could write a novel on the psychological damage they inflicted on me. I've been alone for most of my life. Fun fact, no matter how strong the friendship, EVERYONE you know is capable of flipping a switch in their head and immediately seeing you as the lowest form of scum. Even when they ADMIT the other person is the problem, their actions treat you as the problem. Unless you've seen someone make a VERY difficult choice, then I promise you, you don't know them. Not even slightly. They are a complete stranger to you. Don't believe me? That's fine. You'll learn the same way I did. Give it time. Due to the above and more, I am dead inside. The only way to stop the agony is to force myself to feel nothing (mostly works). It made the depression stop, but it killed almost everything I am emotionally. And the effort of holding down whatever's left just makes me extremely stressed all the time. Through sheer will I have enough control these days to usually prevent panic attacks, but dizzy spells are becoming more common at work. And when I can't hold it down, I self harm. Punishing myself makes things make sense. Surely I wouldn't have been hurt so many times by so many different people unless I deserved it... right? Rationally I know that's not true. But that lie dulls the pain inside when it's too much. Hope is a poison and I will never trust anyone. Never again. So what do I have when my love and hope are dead? Pain. The only thing strong enough to give me the will to live (and not just stop eating) and the will to understand this world, is pain. I hate it, but it's true. Surely someone else who knows what this feels like?

Suic-167,Loneliness and lossing,"Recently I have separated with my wife of 17 years, she kicked me out of our house and in 3 weeks I've only been able to see the kids for 1 hr. By the way I have severe depression. I can't keep friends because of my self-esteem and negativity so no friends. My mum also has depression and we are not super close but I have to stay at her house because I couldn’t sleep in the car any longer. I sit alone in my car or spend hours kicking the soccer ball at the local pitch because I'm making my mum really depressed (unintentionally) if I spend to much time with her and the only other family member I have communication with is my sister who lives pretty far away and only recently started to form a relationship but we are total opposites and can't talk to her about these kind of things. Anyway every night when I get back from work I have to find somewhere to go and avoid being seen by my wife and her parents or they get angry and the parents never liked my anyway. I still love my wife and miss the kids so much. I am really struggling with the loneliness and my wife has told me a couple of times after we planned when I could see the kids that for whatever reason the kids can't make it. So the only thing I have to look forward to keeps getting taken away and because of my depression and anxiety I think she is lying and I make things worse. Currently on meds and seeing a psychologist, new to both, and I know they take time to help with my issues but I am really struggling to think of anything to give me some kind of hope in the short term and just have over bearing thoughts of self pity and loneliness with out hope. I'm having some thoughts about how I could end it all with out pain and suffering and no chance to get it wrong. I'm pretty sure I won't act upon these thoughts but the way I am and the way things are going I'm not so sure I'll feel the same if I keep feeling this way and I can get stop feeling so alone. I do social soccer once a week and it helps for 1hr then more loneliness for the rest of the week. There's more to my negative life but this is my main issue right now. Any advice or some thoughts of how I can overcome this loneliness and give me some kind of hope might be life saving.

Suic-168,TW: Living with Delusional Disorder - Schizophrenia.,"I am 26 years of age. I was diagnosed with Delusional Disorder - Schizophrenia at age 22.5. Mentally, I am on the decline. I have noticed that I am not longer as intelligent and as capable of the things that I previously was capable of doing, such as assignments for adult school. It has always been a dream of mine to get my certificate of education, but that dream is slowly slipping out of my hands. I was bullied relentlessly in mainstream high school over my physical appearance, and it got to the point where I had no choice but to quit mainstream school altogether. The teachers and leadership did completely and utterly nothing about the bullying that I copped from Year 8 to Year 12. I was an A and B student who used to be very studious. I was the 'perfect student,' as so a few teachers had labelled me as. I couldn't do it all anymore - I felt too much pressure to be perfect all the time, and being hard on myself never helped either. I slowly became a D, E and NA student. Going back to adult school, I started off pretty well. I went back up to being an A student again. Then, I met a completely and utterly awful individual who led me on romantically. He had an ex-wife on the side who dictated who he could and couldn't date, let alone speak to. Quite frankly, I believe this man was in a DV relationship with this woman, and I felt that he was too scared to expose her. He told me bluntly that, 'whatever medication that I had been taking clearly wasn't working,' 'I had more issues than previously thought,' 'you're not very clever,' and he then curled his hands into fists and screamed the word, 'RETARD' in my face. I could be wrong, but I feel that he was being coached into saying these things. I wanted to cry, because I used to be very attracted to the man. Well, not anymore. Someone else has come along and I am not even going to bother with this man because I will reject him if he dare comes up to me and asks me out on a date. Why should a delusional, nutcase, schizophrenic with no future ahead of her go out on a date with a good looking man with a good career? Exactly. Going back to my health, I am now having problems with my breathing. I have done some research on this, and COPD is a symptom of Schizophrenia. I cannot breathe at full capacity anymore.

Suic-171,My sister told me to die,"I just recently moved back into my mums house because I couldn’t afford to continue renting while at uni. I had to move back into the room that my sister was staying in, because she said she wanted to move rooms anyway. My plan was to move all my stuff before uni started so I wasn’t trying to do two things at once. I had given my sister over a week to find a new bed and get it delivered or I would pick it up for her. She continued to complain about every single bed I put forward. So I ended up moving her stuff into the front room and shifted my stuff into my room. This obviously really frustrated her, because now she was without a bed. But take into consideration that I (countless times) offered up solutions and she turned every single one down. So after being at my mums for around 2 days, I was cleaning up after dinner and my sister yelled at me, “I hope you get off your meds (antidepressants) and kill yourself”. This was because I put one of her cups into the dishwasher without asking her first. I didn’t really confront her about what she said, I just let her sit in the silence after she said it. I found this horrifying, because out of all the people to say something like this to me, she would be the last person I expected. She, herself, has had issues with suicidal ideation and actually tried to commit while in high school. So this comment from her really shook me to my core. i still haven’t confronted her about what she said, because i truthfully have no idea how to react. I am really upset, and this comment has made me feel unloved and unappreciated in my own home. Has anyone experienced this? Or does anyone have advice? stella",stell_a178,Community Member,27-02-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/my-sister-told-me-to-die/td-p/586117

Suic-174,Unsure about whether to go non-contact with my mum,"Hi, I am in a situation where I am having trouble coming to an appropriate decision.My mum is particularly nasty and has narcissistic tendencies. I feel that her negative behaviours and her predisposition to make situations about her seem more apparent as time goes on, since she bought us the property. She was very difficult to be around when I lived with her and it was detrimental to my wellbeing, but at the moment I definitely feel happier when I haven’t had much contact with her for a while.My mum owns the property I live in. I didn’t want her to buy my sister and I a property but she insisted and often complains about sacrificing money for the property, saying that she could have kept it herself, she wants the money back, most parents don’t do this for their kids and that her mum didn’t help her get a property and blew her money instead. She will not sell until she feels she will get a good deal on the property. I am lost about what to do. I want to go no-contact with my mum. I don’t necessarily have the means to save to purchase my own property yet since a lot of money has been going towards her and the property. I find that being around her tends to be unpleasant and she often invalidates my struggles and makes it about herself.I feel that I need to be prepared to not receive any money after the property is sold anyway because my mum as the owner gets to decide where the money goes, so I don’t want to be in contact with her for the money as it’s not my priority, I just know that there is going to have to be interaction as a renter and I don’t want things to get awkward or tense. Also, renting elsewhere may not be feasible if rent could increase at anytime to the point where it’s almost impossible to pay, especially as I wouldn’t be living with other people. I think that I could save for a deposit, but it would take a while and I don’t want to be abused for much longer.",Unicorn_Kitty,Community Member,18-02-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/unsure-about-whether-to-go-non-contact-with-my-mum/td-p/585520

Suic-176,Complex trip and sh thoughts when doing well,"Hey! I’ve got a bit of a complicated situation that I could use some support I guess on? I’m trans and have been on T for seven months now and finally got my legal name change, which was a bit of a challenge due to me living in Australia but being born in the uk. I’m still a minor so that makes the process even harder. I still am unable to change my legal sex due to having a uk birth certificate. At the end of this year my parents and I are going to east Africa. Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya (we were supposed to go to Ethiopia too but that’s obviously not going to happen given the situation there). It’s sort of a graduation trip for me and a trip my dad has been meaning to take given he was born in Kenya and hasn’t been back since he moved at 5. Anyway I bit of a ramble but it’s a very meaningful trip and I’ve been really looking forward to it. However, it’s east Africa and I’m trans. My parents say for my safety I have to basically live as a girl while I’m there. They’re going to use they/ them pronouns and people around us will treat me as a girl because my mum is afraid of complications that if they don’t and people see my passport with the big ass F on it, my safety will be compromised. I understand the situation and the safety aspect but at the same time I’m so angry and sad and frustrated. I finally thought I was done hiding that now I’m out and on T things would finally be okay and I could be myself. I want to travel, it’s my one dream and I’m so enraged by how being trans has limited so much of my life already, I’m only 16, I’ve wasted at least 5 years in confusion and a false sense of belonging. I don’t know what to do, I’m definitely going and I wouldn’t change that for the world but I don’t want to fall back into a cycle of constant dysphoria and unhealthy coping mechanisms. I’m 50 days clean and the best I’ve been in years but the thought of having to hide away again and pretend is really setting me back mentally.

Suic-177,Negative thoughts pls go away! :(,"Hi, I had used to have gay thoughts since around 1 or 2 years back for a period of time, however I tried to overcome those thoughts by praying to buddha daily, as I am a Buddhist. Even though I managed to overcome them, there was this thought that I ever had for a few days, which indicates that I am destined to be gay. I don't even understand why I had this thought even though I know that I am not gay, as I had tried to experiment myself before. It had triggered my panic attacks, as I had suffered since last year November, when I was preparing for my university exams, and my panic attack has been there for me ever since. I even considered seeing a psychologist as I felt that I could not take it anymore. My panic attack was partly due to stress and it has affected my social and daily life, as I had suffered from panic attacks now and then. I ever tried to counter those stress by taking deep breaths and pray to buddha about it, but it's just that this so-called thought (destined gay thoughts) was the final turning point that had triggered my panic attacks, which made me unable to take it anymore, as I tend to worry a lot unnecessarily. To be honest, I can’t stand being gay now and then I thought of telling my friend and family about this story, but I was afraid of being discriminated as they may get the wrong idea. I was wondering whether it is true that I am destined to be gay.

I suffered from abuse during my childhood and grew up in an unstable and unsupportive household from both parents, won't go into too much detail as it's uncomfortable to think about. I don't know, I'm just tired of feeling numb and empty. I dissociate and feel like I live outside my body, I don't remember things that happen, days blur together. I'm trying to study nursing so I have something in the future, but studying is so impossible at the moment, especially when I can't even get out of bed or shower so I'm barely scraping by, and only getting attendance through being online in bed. I have a partner who I live with and he's wonderful, we both struggle with mental health but it displays very differently for us, so somehow it sort of gets us functioning in a weird way when we work together if that makes sense. I try really hard for him, to get better and not show how much I'm struggling because I know it really impacts his wellbeing when I'm in my lows. I love him and don't want him to be sad which is why I haven't done anything yet. I want to try and build a future with him, and be healthy with him, but everything I try doesn't seem to work. I've been to many therapists, none of which has actually helped me. I've tried medication which has actually done more harm than good for me, I've done every single mindfulness, meditation, art, music therapy, hobbies which I can't seem to find interest in anything. I've even dabbled into spirituality because I was so desperate for something, but I just can't believe in it.

I have no family around except for a brother (and sister in law,and niece), who would rather spend time with their friends - even though I pushed myself to be there for their daughters birthday. My teeth are rotting because of pain meds and I have no way of paying for them to be fixed.. some are now are in my smile line and the idea of loosing teeth there destroys me. My extended family wanted me to join them on Christmas day except for the fact it would be just breakfast as they want to visit their significant others family (not to mention it's a 4 hour round trip for me on public transport on a public holiday), and I can barely function as I'm suffering from tinnitus and vertigo at the moment on top of my usual health issues. I'm struggling to get through to the rest of the year. I've been reaching out via text message to my closest friend - but he's been avoiding me. My other friend just doesn't believe how bad my mental state is; despite having her own issues with depression and suicide.

Suic-186,There is no room in my life for me anymore,"I am a wife, mum of two (2+4), and I work 2 jobs. I struggled a lot with becoming a mum. I'm certainly not a naturally maternal person. I am independent, I love learning, I'm smart (probably the only thing about myself I am confident in), and I like to achieve goals... So when my days were reduced to changing nappies and getting small people to sleep ... I was not in a good way. I felt like my whole identity got ripped away. Anyway, as soon as I fell pregnant with the first, my husband totally lost interest in me sexually. That hasn't changed. I could count on one hand how many times we've been intimate in the last 6-12 months. He struggles with what I am 99% sure is ADHD. He is very carefree (to the point of not noticing massive dangers sometimes) and I am quite risk averse... Which obviously causes some tension in regards to the kids. Prior to kids it was never really an issue - because his decisions didn't really impact anyone else... But now they impact the kids, and I won't not advocate for what I think is best for the kids... So tension often follows - as does the trope around me being ""irrational"" ""impossible"" ""crazy"" ""insane"" etc etc. Don't get me wrong, we have fun times too. And I love my husband... But having kids has made things impossible. It's gotten to the point where if I raise ANYTHING that he disagrees with he will start the ""I can never do anything right"" script. I inevitably have to become the fun police (a role I hate being forced to play), and he reiterates how ""exhausting"" my ""negative energy"" is. I have had these kids, and I don't like mothering. I'm not good at mothering. They've wrecked our marriage. They destroyed my body so no one else will love me. I can't leave, because I can't bear the thought of someone else raising them... So I'm just stuck. I'm stuck living this hollow life where I can't even advocate for my kids and do the best I can as a mother (which is already not great). I just feel totally trapped.

He took a job in another state and looked forward to a new start, but she followed him there. I have just driven hours to bring him home. He can’t see what she’s doing to him and still loves her.

I struggled greatly living at home with my brother (accused of molesting my sister) as he has Scizophrenia and the sick, psychotic nature of his illness was always my problem. My other sister moved out and got pregnant young. My oldest brother left at 17, and I was trying to study/work and hopefully do law but the environment was so unhealthy I didn’t do well. My parents always worked. They were never home…always using money to compensate for them not being there. I put a lock on my own door to protect myself. but my anger now comes from finding out that my brother at 17 and onwards… never tried to protect me or my sister. He also found out dad was having an affair and didn’t tell Mum because Dad said it would ruin the business/money that my Brother no doubt benefited from. He is still the golden child. Im suicidal to the point I have a plan. I feel sick with the blood that runs through my veins. I have been suicidal for over a year due to physical pain. Now, the year long triggers regarding my mother, father, brothers….makes me feel constantly worthless. No amount of mirror work, meditation, journaling helps now, because I’m stuck being supported by the only people that make me feel that way. I can’t manage on my own. Even with community support, it’s not enough. My life is physical hell and I’m physically stuck in it. It’s a special kind of torture.",Serenity22,Community Member,09-01-2024,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,23,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-just-found-out-my-brother-knew-our-other-brother-molested-and/td-p/582335
Suic-195,I called the Suicide call back service today.,"I am grateful for the suicide call back service. I see their number all the time but today I had the courage to call them. I have been spiralling down since last December and trying to cope alone. I hate to rely on my children. But my son didn’t answer or reply this morning, so I called someone else. A complete stranger. Someone who makes themselves available on a Sunday morning to help total strangers like me to basically stay alive for another day. My darling son did eventually reply to me and I told him that I would be ok now. I hate to burden him with this. I love and appreciate him so much. I want to stay for him and I want to see him thrive. He deserves better. I am trying to be better for him and he is keeping me going for now. I know that if I go now, this would cause him so much distress and stress. I love him so dearly. He’s the kindest sweetest person that I’ve ever known. Just pure good. People like him deserve so much more and so much better. He’s an amazing young man. I so wished that I had half the goodness and courage and compassion that he possesses. I have such a throbbing headache from crying since 8am this morning and I can’t seem to stop it. My eyes are so sore from the tears. I am going to be a wreck tomorrow for work.

Once I push ( not physically) my children away I have a tendency to jump in my car and self halm. If no relieve I then tempt suicide . I'm sitting here the last 2 days with strong urges, thoughts popping up randomly.I would love for this pain to be gone for good. But then my kids would feel pain. Living in this torture is horriable.

Suic-203,The housing crisis in perth makes me feel suicidal,"I feel extermely guilty for feeling like this because i've got a good job, i get payed well but the recent spike in housing prices just as i've finally saved up enough to buy a house is turning into the straw that broke the camels back. I've been depressed an anxious for a long time. there's lots of reasons i got depressed, it'd take too long to explain it all but as a general rule i've cry'd almost everyday for the last 10ish years, i've planned my suicide at least 1000 times by now, i don't have energy for hobbies or loved ones. i'm very tired. As a rule, just as life starts getting good for me, everything always falls apart. I have a partner, they make me ""happy,"" but something still feels very wrong with my existance. I'm not really okay, i'm not really happy. The main thing that really kept me alive this long was telling myself if i work hard and save up things will be okay one day. i'll be able to afford a nice home and go on nice holidays etc. the struggle will be worth it. i finally save up enough to go on a holiday, covid hits and we can't travel. i save up enough to buy a house, prices go through the roof and i can't afford anything any more. Everyone says prices will go down so i save up and wait. but they don't come down, the supply is dwindling, the only thing left is small units hours from work and i'm just tired of it all. Whats the point of working hard if theres never a happy ending to it. whats the point of spending 12 hours of my day paying taxes to then spend the rest of it crying and stressing about the future. Everyone else seems to have bought a house at the right time, gone on holiday's at the right time, found a fun hobby but the right time never seems to come for me. it's like my existance is cursed. I was born decades too late. i'm nearly half way through my natural life and it all feels like a waste, it's just constant suffering. I was finally starting to see an upside then the housing and cost of living crisis hits and i'm just done.

So I guess that’s suicide ideation. The only reason I hold back is my two children that are my sole responsibility. I feel so helpless , I can’t make anything better and I also can’t escape. Recently I just feel there’s no one I can talk to anymore. I’ve been in a bad state of depression most of the last year and I’m that time I’ve drifted away from people and been socially avoidant. I also don’t get any time away from my kids and they hate spending time away from me and usually guilt trip me when I try and do anything without them.

Suic-205,hopeless. the battle is neverending.,"Hi all, I haven't been here in a while. I'm getting no where. And honestly, I'm at the end of my tether. I've done all the thing people say to do - I've reached out, I try to do self care, seek therapy, use healthy coping strategies... but nothing seems to work. I've been pushed between countless mental health professionals and GP's because they say they can't help me. I'm SO exhausted. It feels like I can't escape this feeling of hopelessness. It's crushing me, its like this heavy weight on my shoulders that prevents me from being happy. Between juggling an eating disorder, depression, anxiety, OCD, self harm and suicidal thoughts for so long, it just doesn't work. I want to make the pain stop. I need it to stop. I need it to all go away. Not long ago, I was close to attempting to take my own life, and the thing that stopped me was literally that I numbed out and being unable to physically move my body. I just sat there for an hour. In hindsight, I'm glad that happened so that I didn't do anything I would regret, but there's a part of me that still wishes I was gone, that the countless near misses had been plans followed thru. It's so confusing though. I don't know if i want to die. I am safe from these thoughts tonight, I just need a space to express them.

Suic-207,"I’m new, and I’m not ok.","I’d rather speak on here than to a friend or family member. My suicidal thoughts began a year ago, linked to several surgeries involving malpractice and bad luck, surrounded with betrayal from a past partner and being kicked out of the house and back to my home state, with nowhere to live and no job, with health issues. My physical health won’t be the same. Not a moment in my day exists without physical pain. I’m nobody’s priority. Sometimes ppl say… oh, well you look good…you’re smart, and still have your looks at 41… and somehow ppl think that has any effect on my physical pain. I think some ppl look at slim, attractive women and think they have no problems. My pain is physical and it can’t be seen. I can’t wear shoes, or go barefoot so I lay or sit most of the time. I had a procedure a few days ago and the anaesthetic is no doubt causing depression which I don’t normally feel. I feel sad, or pain, or ptsd traits like nightmares but not depression. Not like this. The last person who betrayed me contacted me yesterday and the timing is leaving me in a spiral, where I have gone through the motions of how I will end things. I tell myself… if a pink rose appears on the tv in the next 2 scenes, I won’t do it. I wish I could find a reason to stay.. hope…hope for my health that something can be done. But ive lost my ability to exercise, take care of myself, work, and lost the chance of a family and possibly a relationship…ever. And that’s a life I can’t see me living.

Suicidal thought have been occurring more frequently over the past 4 months & I literally prepared to do it, but, the ONLY thing that has stopped me is what it will do to my parents. I recently found out dad has a heart condition. I know it would probably kill him if I was to follow through, which would absolutely destroy my mum. I don't want to do that to them, but there's also the thought in my mind that I cannot continue to live this way. These thoughts make me start to resent my parents, who are the most loving, caring & beautiful parents anyone could hope for. I have so much pain, anger, guilt, despair & resentment, on top of the constant anxiety, depression, stress & nothingness that it am so drained of wanting to be here anymore. I have seen a therapist, but in the last few months I have 'put on an act' to make it seem like I'm coping a little better, just small improvements each time so it doesn't feel like I'm faking it.

Suic-213,Suicidailty and DSP application,"I am on the cusp of applying for the Disability Support Pension. The disability employment agency I’m with and my psychologist are supportive and encouraging for me to do this. At 48 I’ve had lifelong chronic pain and multiple challenges with traumatic and stressful experiences. In 2005-2008 my pain levels were extreme and I had to stop work but fought my way back into work doing a program with the then Commonwealth Rehab Service and retraining at TAFE to be an education assistant. I was on synthetic opioid meds to be able to do this. I’ve worked at many jobs over the years. In the last few years my stress levels have been extreme as a primary carer to my parents before they died and numerous other stresses. I’m diagnosed with complex PTSD from childhood experiences and have an autoimmune liver disease. Although on the face of it I may look like a good candidate for DSP, I know it’s extremely hard to get now. The process itself triggers me and I find suicidality comes up every time I have to deal with it. I’ve been advised by an advocacy group who provide advice on DSP to apply on either mental health grounds or physical health grounds but not both as if you fail the impairments test on one they will fail you on both. They’ve also advised the hour long job capacity assessment interview involves them trying to trip you up multiple times by asking you the same question in different ways. Basically it is an adversarial process designed to make you fail. Someone else with my employment agency who cannot stand up for more than 5 minutes at a time was refused it. A man I met at a DSP info session was also told he won’t be able to get it despite the gruelling impacts of two cancers and immunotherapy that has damaged his cognitive capacity and ability to function. I’ve had fibromyalgia since 13, a condition many doctors have not considered real. I’ve actually had a doctor throw a packet of anti-inflammatories at me and told to “get over it” when I went to him for a second opinion about a med another doctor wanted to put me on. I’ve had severe migraines since 13 as well and the only way I got through decades of work was to medicate as I would be debilitated with the frequent migraines otherwise. The liver disease I now have may even be partly a consequence of the long term medication to be able to get through the work day. So I just feel scared and seriously overwhelmed with the DSP application. I am so tired of fighting to survive.

I’ve been here before where I have tried to take my own life before and I haven’t started cutting again but the only reason is because I can’t be bothered to buy the razors. I have tried multiple therapists and been on different medications but nothing works, I’ve tried those self help apps with the cute animals. I’ve even tried starving myself to be better. I’m afraid that if I go down this path again I will not make it out the other side. I have nobody to talk to about this.

Suic-219,obsessed with psychologist,"I’m 36 years old female, mother to a 3 years old daughter and wife to a good caring husband. First I entered therapy for anger management and get rid off suicidal thoughts from my mind. One day I missed my appointment and she rang me. I apologised and I was willing to pay the cancellation fee. But she stated I don’t want to pay if it’s happened again they will charge cancellation fee next time. This is the first day I started to search about her. I just wanted to find who is this good person. I found her and her family on facebook. I spent hours looking at her photos. Then after I started to develop romantic/erotic thoughts about her. I’m totally obsessed with her. Every single second she Invaded my mind. I couldn’t forget her.I never ever felt about a woman before. I worried about my sexuality. I decided to speak with her as I thought she would be understanding and help me to cope with this situation. Instead of helping me she suggested to transfer me to an another psychologist. I didn’t want to lose her, I did my best to control my thoughts. I went to a retreat and started doing meditation and It was helpful to stay in the present moment. Unfortunately I had a car accident. I was so shocked panicked and couldn’t sleep. Then after those thoughts popped up again. I wanted to speak to her but couldn’t get an appointment. Then I sent an email to her asking help. She didn’t reply to my email. Then after I had a panic attack. I wanted to get suicide. I didn’t want to leave my daughter alone in this world without a mum. I thought if I terminate therapy it would be easier to forget her. So I requested to terminate therapy. Then she rang me again and asked to come for one more session. I was so surprised, I didn’t expect a call from her. I went and when I see her I felt so good and I didn’t want to terminate the therapy. But she wanted to terminate the therapy. She suggested me two places to find another therapist. My whole world collapsed down. I didn’t know how I walked away and drove to home. Then after she blocked my fb account. It was so painful and I cried a lot I was out of my mind. I looked for options to get sucide. I started to drink alcohol. My condition got worse. I felt I was rejected or abounded by the person I mostly trusted. I really missed her. Her presence always made me happy. Then I started with waiting and watching her as she left her office in the evening. Then following her home. stalking her on the internet., invading her privacy. This eventually consumed my life. One day she caught me when I followed her. Then after I didn’t follow her. I’m afraid to break the law. I’m a good lawful citizen. I was filled with shame. Then my psychiatrist increased my medication dose . It helped me to settled my depression. I permanently deleted all of my social media accounts. We wanted to have an another baby. I spoke to my psychiatrist and requested to reduce the dose and we did. But now those thoughts are popping up again. I feel again I miss her. It’s extremely painful. I fight with my thoughts. The pressure builds up in my mind drives me in to suicidal ideation. I searched the options in the internet to get sucide. Can’t I have an another baby? I’m afraid, i will regret in 10 years because of these thoughts I couldn’t have an another child. I’m afraid,one day my daughter will hates me. She will question why my mum loved her psychologist than me and why she left me and committed suicide . I’m totally obsessed with my psychologist. I can’t get her out of my head. When I entered therapy I had no idea any of this would happen. It’s so painful,humiliating, disgusting and disappointing. Please somebody help me.Please tell me how to get her out from my head.

At that time i wasn't aware of the term ""self-harm"" so it like a prefect treatment for me when i'm feeling down and depressed. and it's gets worst when one time i was crying and self-harmed. It was a really bad start like a pandora's box. typically i don't have anything big to make me self-harm, because i read about some relating articles, my life was just normal and sometimes quite good, i'm sorry, this sounds that i'm a picky person, but that method seems to be the only treatment i have as i got older, my temper also gets bad in times. Based on my symptoms i thought i could be having bpd or something, but i know i can't just self-diagnosis these just because i have a bad temper. my family is really traditional, they don't want their kid to be mentally ill, and i don't have the money to go up to a mental doctor. I barely have a suicided thoughts but it disappear when i think about everything i've got now. i used to have minor evidence on self-harm on my arms, it's really light so no one ever noticed it, but one time my family member asked what happend and i have to deny nothing but random scratches. than i think it's worse because i start to self-harm on my thigh, and i'm hematophobia so i'm under extreme sad was released by self harm and a strong dizziness. i won't suicide, i know myself. just wanna find somewhere to share my feelings, i have no friends to share my struggles, they prob think i'm weird, used to a have a friends online that i told about it implicitly, they give me good feedbacks and comforts but i don't wants to keep annoy them with my negative feeling everyday. About the bpd thoughts, i have a bad temper when i was little, i thought it's generally passed down from one of my family member, but for now i'm not too sure about it...i wrote this down because i'm in another extreme emotional downhill, the only thing i can do is self harm and keep crying, really don't know what to do.

Suic-221,how do i move on with life,hello just going to start by saying idk if anyone else is similar but i’m really struggling with what to do next had some stuff happen (SA/other) and i’ve got a bit of trauma from it but during that time of my life i was self harming daily and tried to leave this earth a couple times. all that coupled with anxiety and depression sent me down a crazy spiral it’s now been a while since all that stuff and life has improved significantly. i no longer harm and stuff like that however i do still think about it all the time i know that i shouldn’t and that it’s wrong to do it and even though i have no real reason i can’t seem to get it out of my head. i want to put it all behind me but i’m really not sure how to. like i feel as though i should be over it now but it still affects me quite a bit and i still have panic attacks and stuff about it even though it can no longer hurt me anyone else in a similar boat or have any idea what to do. i’m really stuck. i just want to be done with it all and forget about it already,IGA,Community Member,18-12-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/how-do-i-move-on-with-life/td-p/580554
Suic-222,Grieving Suicide,"I'll preface by saying that I'm not at immediate risk of suicide, and that I've discussed this with my psych and my partner. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has felt like this too. In 2016 I had a serious suicide attempt (not to say all attempts shouldn't be considered serious. Just that drs aren't sure how I survived it). Things got better. I met my wonderful partner in 2017, we have had loads of fun and adventures. And he's always been so supportive when I struggle. We had our daughter in 2020 and, despite some PPA, any times.of depression has been fairly brief. Until now. I'm suffering a long and very deep bout of depression. And I've realised, suicide is no longer an option because I'd never leave our daughter. So that means, no matter how bad things get, I have to suffer it, no matter what. There's no longer that option of a way out. I've massively spiralled since realising this and I have no idea how to cope with it. Suicide was always a safety net you know? Now it isn't. Now I'm stuck. Having depression (granted at varying degrees) for the rest of my life. Had anyone else struggled with this realisations? I get that protective factors are supposed to be a good thing, but right now I'm really resenting them. I can't self harm or just get obliterated on alcohol. Logically I know this is a good thing. But it doesn't feel good. It feels way worse. And I can never end my life. No matter how bad it gets. I honestly don't know how to cope with this realisation.

I have recently, in fact just yesterday, cancelled my psychiatrist appointments, of which yes again P have only managed to complete one of. I have tried over and over again, to find the trust to confide in someone else, but it really isn't me. I don't know if its the fact that I don't know the person, not having trust in them, or not having the trust in myself, because yes I want to get better, and feel happy, but I feel like I don't deserve that, I don't deserve to be happy. Or is it just that I don't know how to put my feelings and thoughts into words, I mean how can I when I don't even understand any of these thoughts and feelings myself. sometimes, well actually a lot of the times I want to die, I know the world would be better off without me, and that no one would care, let alone realize that I'm gone. But at the same time I guess I don't want to die, sometimes I self harm, not with the intentions to die, but with the purpose of it feeling like a way, a thing that I have control over, a way to defeat this depression, a way to simply let go of some of it. However I am now 3 months sober of self harm, yes it still crosses my mind, but you must know that the worse of these thoughts provenly only last 90 seconds, as my therapists told me, so just think of something that will distract you for those 90 seconds.

Unfortunately that has not been my experience for a long time living in the country. My GP kept telling me he would make an appointment with me to do a mental health care plan. That took about 6 months. At an appointment I basically told him I needed help, could he please do the plan that day and not make me wait another 4 weeks for a next appointment. The psychologist he recommended sent me an email stating with the information the Dr had written in the referral she was unable to assist me. She had not even met me! Wait another 4 weeks for another Drs appointment. A new psychologist was recommended, I had to drive to the city for this one. Had to wait a couple of months for an appointment. My appointment was to be on Thursday this week. Received an email from the psychologist stating ""due to changes in his circumstances he is no longer able to offer me sessions"". I go to the local hospital and am told ""the Doctors are too busy seeing more important patients to be able to see you"". The Nurse/Sister actually stated that to me over and over. Looks like me and my sick mind are just going to have to keep trying to support myself until it doesn't work any longer.",Doolhof,Champion Alumni,21-03-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,277,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/struggling-to-get-help/td-p/561461
Suic-249,last night,"Last night I was having very intense urges. I tried all sorts of things to try and overcome it, meditation, the calm harm app, went for a walk around the block, listened to music, ate chocolate, cold shower, contacted lifeline. Nothing was working. I finally decided to text a friend and we just chatted about work, life, family, music just random stuff. It started to work. Three and a half hours after the urge started, I was over it. And I was not injured in any way. I was so exhausted. It was a particularly bad day yesterday at work and I am sure that added to it but to go from urges that last half hour tops to three and a half hours was just insane. Hope that never happens again",K_Ley,Community Member,27-10-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/last-night/td-p/577407
Suic-250,In a mental health crisis with no support,"I have severe anxiety and depression. A bit of background-I am 40 female. Had mild agoraphobia and strong social phobia and GAD all my adult life. Was sexually abused age 14 and then moved with my parents to a beautiful secluded 5 acres just out of a seaside town and learnt to adjust to being rural and gardening and chickens ducks even sheep. I found it hard in my late teens and 20s to socialise- i had no help from my parents - dad only drove mum couldnt and dad was always working so if i wanted to go out i walked an hour into town and back. That was most of my 20s. Tho I met a man when i was 24 online, he convinced me to fly interstate to stay with him for a week so i did out of character and he ended up emotionally and sexually abusing me at first sight and it was an ongoing stay for months that i managed to get out of and it took years to get over. I became more of a recluse. Being home on acres with a view all is my world. I feed all the local birds who rely on me including cockatoos. I love being in nature, open wildish spaces with gumtrees and greenery. The fresh air. Been basically a recluse here for 26 years, since i was 14 and now i am 40. My parents i live with, they in thier 70s now. Dad is mildly abusive and my whole adult life ive had to be a bit like a man, a bit like a slave really - non emotional - he can be frightening with him, he will tell me i have to do this and even if i dont want to i have to. Ive only had one job all my life and that was for 4 years i really enjoyed but it went bankrupt and also i met a partner turned friend from their whom has paranoid schizophrenia and hes been in my life for 8 years since and its been very hard on me, even tho i need the company, hes the only one that knows me well and only immediate friend i have. ive been driving since 2010. I drive mum everywhere and its hard to even get independence much in my family. Start of this year my dads new car caught on fire in our long driveway and mum and i had to run with buckets to put it out. After that, Ive had to dedicate my life to driving both my parents with dad’s heavy bowling schedule and mums things - had little room for myself. Even planning my day, id end up with dad interfering with my plans and just give up. I was burnt out and severly depressed and anxious when it got to May. I took a year saving for my car and at that time i couldnt go out because dad in his car would complain about petrol if i did. So I was also angry. Then my dad out of nowhere told me that he is selling this place and he want mum and i to quickly look for a house within the span of 3 months so that the money from the sale can be invested into shares so my sister can get a house. So that caused me severe distress. Being ordered to leave my comfort home on acres what im used to where i am most of the time, to look at urban very small spaces, i couldnt get my head around it. The amount of pressure from my dad making us go to inappropriate hpuse inspections cause in winter there was hardly anything on the market. Everything was distressing for me.

Suic-251,can't win,"i've had a pretty awful last 2 months it never ends always one thing after another, it all started at work 2 months ago when i was getting overwhelmed by finances and my job and just life in general, i went to wrok one day when i should of been at home and just wasn't feeling it, smoko came i droved out to get smoko then i get a text saying we got a meeting in 15 minutes, short notice so i was a little late, i sat there upset with everything and then i just walked out and slammed the door and walked downstairs sobbing then went home for the rest of the day. i have a mental illness and i felt like i wasn't supported by this employer enough, i think i was upset not just of my debts i'm paying off but also the fact that work was getting overwhelming and what they expected of me as a first year apprentice and just dropping tools and jumping from breakdown to breakdown all the time and getting told to go quickly and i'm busting my ass off there basically trying to take everything in, me having autism spectrum doesn't help, i got a warning for my walking out but truth be told i never once took my problems out on anyone there. fast foward 3 weeks later and i cut my thumb with a kitchen knife, went to the doctors next morning and was told to take 2 days off work which i provided a medical certificate for. no worries, i come back to work for two more days then it's the weekend. on the saturday, i was working on my car and used a wrench and my hand slipped off it and it hit the body of my car breaking my thumb, went to hospital that night then got surgery the next day, i was in hospital worrying about my finances and my job. so went home next few days and was on antibiotics painkillers, had a meeting with my group training company saying there were performance issues. met with them again the next week and the company i worked for decided to get rid of me saying i got sacked because of what i metioned here, i'm still trying to chase payments from them from trade school as well. i'm still with the group training place, but to get sacked like that when i gave it my all at work and saying i'm not good enough without being given the opportunity to develop my skills was a dagger in the heart, i'm still depressed and upset over it, i mean why do i go thru this badluck with apprenticeships, all i want to do is go to work and learn my job, that's the 2nd employer in the space of 12 months, i feel like when something happens i can't control there's big consequences",luke_c,Community Member,20-10-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,6,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/can-t-win/td-p/576976
Suic-252,Not coping,"Yesterday morning I was in a dark place MH wise. Everything hurt so much that didn’t want to live anymore. Thanks to the love of 2 cats I phoned local prevention team and spoke to MH nurse who as part of the phone conversation triaged me and did referral for me to be accepted into their program. Tried doing different things during the day but couldn’t settle. Ended up driving approx 30mins and spending few hours with a cousin. Another disturbed and restless night but ‘slept’ for 13 hours. about 1pm returned miss call and spoke to Ben from local MH team who has booked me an appointment for 1pm tomorrow to start to get help from the team. He advised team consists of variety of experienced staff including psychologists and psychiatrists and that while I am under their care they will provide updates to my local dr plus current therapists. as I explained to this Ben, I’ve only recently moved to lifestyle village so I don’t feel so alone and have lots of social activities I can choose to get involved in to give me things to do but last few days my thoughts have gone negative again …. I’m tired, tired of being in tears that I can’t stop and can last for hours, tired of within the same day flipping from being happy to being in tears. Without my cats I dread to think what actions I would have taken within last few days. I am safe and know I would never intentionally do anything to leave my cats alone.

I have autism, I know I will probably never have the connections and relationships I dream about, so dreaming about it is the only way I can experience it - to have to snap out of it and realise I will be lonely, unlovable and ugly for the rest of my life hurts more than anything and it terrifies me. I feel like daydreaming is the only thing that keeps me alive, I can talk to someone who cares about me and comforts me when I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown (which helped me stay safe in the past)... a person who doesn't exist. If I stop im scared I’ll want to kill myself ill be so alone, but if I keep going I’ll kill my future and then it feels like i will have no choice but to. Im ok for now, but scared for my future.

Suic-257,Managed to get through self harm and suicidal thoughts today,"A trigger today pushed me over into a drive towards thoughts of self-harm. I need to tell someone as I don't feel I have anyone I can talk to, even if I am talking to invisible cyberspace. The trigger was being informed by the strata company of a particular pesticide possibly being sprayed on the lawns where I live. Something told me to research it. I have a disease that destroys the intrahepatic bile ducts (small bile ducts in the liver). The research I found indicated this pesticide's strongest correlation with cancers is specifically cancer of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Given my liver has only recently stabilised it felt stressful to deal with, as I am doing everything to try to prevent it progressing. But I've spoken to the gardener today and will get back to him and the strata company tomorrow to advise I don't want it to be sprayed, at least not on my lawn. I know he will agree following our conversation today not to do it during which I told him I'm going to do research to look into it. But it was the feeling of being invaded by something toxic that just pushed me over the edge. I've been dealing with very upsetting toxic family circumstances that I feel powerless to do anything about, and then being told of an actual toxin that felt like a threat being sprayed at my home sent me into further feelings of powerlessness. I just had a major drive to self-harm because I've been dealing with intense grief and already woke this morning with a really strong feeling of sick anxiety that has been there for a couple of weeks now. I just desperately needed to feel something other than distress and powerlessness. I feel I have lost the family I once knew as part of my identity. I feel very much alone. I have a lovely cousin but she is dealing with significant challenges herself at the moment, and I don't want to burden her with my stuff. And my good friend in the city has a beautiful new baby, and I haven't wanted to bring distress into their world. I have a very kind neighbour who has said I can drop in for a cup of tea anytime. But because of so many experiences of being harmed since a child I really struggle to believe anyone is safe, even when they show multiple instances of being safe. I am still waiting for something to go wrong and someone to turn and hurt me. My psychologist is one of the few people I know are safe, but I probably even protect her in a way from the worst of what I feel. At times I am just in unbearable distress because I feel so isolated. I am very used to isolation which I felt from the beginning of life, but it's like my system can't do it anymore. I've made major efforts in the past to connect outwardly and it's been helpful in many instances, but the additional traumas of the last few years have made the world seem even more threatening. I have a lot of trauma flashbacks. I know I need to have some good experiences to counter the bad ones, but my trust has been really damaged. I feel the only safe place is to withdraw. I know there are some safe people, like the kind ladies in the local cafe. One of them has been particularly kind with me and basically drew it out of me that I was struggling after I kept trying to say ""I'm good"". It's really hard for me not to deflect. I know if I allow myself to feel the anxiety and be present with it, it helps more than if I try to suppress it. So I think it will ease in the coming days. But I just needed to write that out. I feel I have no one to tell what I'm going through, at least I don't want to tell them the worst things. I can feel I still have some life-preservation instinct left so I think I will fight for my own life. It's just such a struggle sometimes to keep going.",Eagle Ray,Valued Contributor,18-10-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,8,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/managed-to-get-through-self-harm-and-suicidal-thoughts-today/td-p/576773

I have self-harmed 3 times, been to the doctor for medical attention for the last one, had my first ever suicidal thought and somehow come out the other side. I have some amazing supportive friends and the support through these forums is incredible. I am not under any illusions that somehow my darkest hours are done and dusted, but for now I am ok. I hope I never go through a similar experience as what I have since Tuesday lunchtime, but I am also fully aware that it is a possibility that it will happen again. This journey only really started for me a matter of a couple of months ago, but I have already learnt so much about mental illness and the things that sufferers go through.

Suic-260,Theories on suicidal thoughts,"HiOne of my favourite psychologists is Jordan Peterson. He has hundreds of videos on Youtube. He mentions in one lecture that his belief is that a common reason for suicidal thoughts is that the person cannot tolerate the complexities of their lives. For us humans have hundreds of tasks every day and new ones coming along not to mention the stresses of financial struggles, bullying, separation from family and friends and possible drug abuse. And those can be the tip of the iceberg. Perhaps to help ourselves we should lower that complexity by reverting to a pre adult simplicity. Reduce stress numbers by removing them. Toxic friends or family? remove them. Consolidate debts, draw up a financial plan so you have a better outlook in 12 months. And so on. Shape a +ve pathway. I've long time been an advocate for replacing negative thinking for positive outlooks and plans. Reading posts here of how people are treated poorly at school (bullying) or their own negative thinking so inground they know no other way of thinking. Please allow me to guide you- there is no better transformation to a better life than realising your thinking is self destructive and to move towards a positive outlook on everything- everything. You hurt your leg and you spend weeks in a wheelchair - think! you have arms and hands to write, to touch a loved ones face to show care... how lucky You fail a topic at school, give yourself time to adjust to it then think! how lucky you can get education. Drop that subject, add another, we all have limits so accept it that it isnt a topic for you. Be realistic You have an upset at home, go for a walk, focus on life, on the bees collecting nectar, the old lady carrying shopping inside (offer to help as helping others elevates your worth), feel the breeze Climb a hill once a month. Sit in silence and watch the sun set. It will take 2 hours start to finish. Dont move. When I did this a small bird landed on my shoulder- how special is that? Appreciate the wonder of a sunset. Occasionally remove yourself from your obsessions like study, mobile phones, games and ""fun"". Add to your life the addictiveness of life itself. It's right at your doorstep if you look. Love yourself, your uniqueness.. there is no other like you. So, are you hoping for a small change to your life? I wouldn't be happy unless it totally transformed your life. https://wordpaint.com/prem/en/when_sunset.htm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X30sWycWz4o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgh08mZ355Q TonyWK",white knight,Community Champion,10-10-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,14,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/theories-on-suicidal-thoughts/td-p/576267

Suic-262,Suicidal,"Hi. I have not been in a good headspace lately. Last night, before I phoned the mental health triage, I had self-harmed. The lady over the phone was brilliant. I was honest with her about the way I which I felt. I have been experiencing increased suicidal ideation over the past month in particular, and for a variety of reasons. Firstly, I am only young, and I have a restraining order that has been against my name for over the past four years. I was told that it would last a lifetime. Basically, I had a stupid crush on a bus driver who I stalked because I didn't have the courage to ask him out on a date. I really liked him, too. He ultimately and obviously rejected me, despite telling me in his own words that he had 'always liked me, but had kept it from me.' That took a shock to my system and I ended up hospitalised in the psychiatric ward of two different hospitals three times, and I almost went to jail. While it has taken four years for me to move on from him, at the same time, I have not really healed properly. Secondly, I am looking to move out of home and start a family of my own. I certainly do not mean having children of my own, because I well and truly believe that I am too mentally incompetent to bear them, but I want to find a motherly and fatherly figure to add to my life, as my own biological parents are addicted to drinking and gambling. My mother speaks with a psychologist over the phone. My father is a lost cause. My mother and I fight nearly every weekend. She has never held a driver's licence and expects me to pick her up from work most nights. Thirdly, I have only two friends, and I have been very unsuccessful at making new ones. I have this one friend who I have known for two decades. We're supposed to be going away next year and she was too hesitant to buy a seat to sit next to me on the plane, because it wasn't for free. Boggles the mind. Meanwhile, I have another friend who I have known for one decade, and she literally shouted me dinner (because she knows that I am currently on Job Seeker). She spent nearly $80. I think that it is worth mentioning that I am currently different psychiatrists on a rotational basis, which really does not help when having to discuss my trauma and obvious misdiagnosis of Hebephrenic Schizophrenia all over again. I want to see a psychiatrist privately, but I can not afford to see one.",goldilocks,Community Member,15-10-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/suicidal/td-p/576605
Suic-263,Suicidal thoughts,"Hi, It’s been a few years, but I’m back here again. It’s funny how so much time has passed, so much has changed, and yet… here I am again spiralling back down. But this time feels different… this time I’m calm. I don’t have the irrational, out of mind emotion to self harm again… this time I have a plan and I feel calm about it. Very long story short… I’ve been bullied from a young age, I was sexually abused by my cousin at a young age, I’ve been raped by a bf but had no fight in me to report it, I fell for a narcissist and was emotionally abused for two years which took another two to recover from… I then got roped in to an ex and later found he had a gf the whole time… to now being played by another for months, told everything you want to hear then dropped like you are nothing and says he’s emotionally unavailable (i.e. met someone else)… I was emotionally neglected by my mother as a child and I have done the counselling and am actually very self aware of my trauma and attachment style. Though I did everything ‘right’ for this last guy and really worked on boundaries and communication and needs… and yet, still got played…. I have everything else I’ve ever wanted in my life which has taken a lot of work and time… and yet, I’m feeling it’s becoming impossible to find a genuine loving partner. I give and they simply take. I have nothing left to give. I was happy being alone for many years. Though now, at almost 37, the thoughts of going home every day alone has become unbearable. I just moved interstate away from family and friends. I feel like I’ve literally run out of reasons to live. If you’re not able to love and be loved in return, I simply see no point. ‘Things’ don’t matter to me. I don't think I can spend another bday, another Christmas, another new years alone.

Suic-264,What do I do?,"About a year ago I moved and left everything I’ve ever known. Since then, sure there have been some good things, but my mental health has gone downwards and badly. My brother has ADHD and everything is always about him. My parents don’t know that I have Snapchat and it has caused me so many problems over the last few days. One of my friends, who is a lot older than me has told me he likes me and I’ve never had anyone say that before and I’ve never liked anyone romantically. I had to tell him and set boundaries, hurting him in the process. I’m the sort of person that can’t hurt anyone and is guilt tripped easily. I self harmed and it’s not the first time I’ve spiralled like this. It’s healing now and I came to an agreement with this friend and we started talking again. Then a few days ago one of my friends had a panic attack in class and he was the one to calm her down and I later snapped at her cause I felt like I wasn’t needed. And then tonight, my friend, the one who had the panic attack, and I where talking about going to Neverland and finding a bridge and dieing and he has snapped and said he doesn’t care anymore and that guilt tripped me. He has also been really toxic and not really caring about me and my friend but neither of us have the courage to unadd him. To top it all off, my mother has been away for ages and I’ve been doing all the cooking and house work and wanting to cry all day every day and not being able to while my dad and brother sit on their asses doing nothing.

Suic-268,Death of Hope,"Hello, everyone. I have suffered with depression and anxiety since young teens. My chronic joint pain, vision issues, dizziness, add extra weight to my suffering. Ever since i was 12 i realized how artificial and manufactured reality is and i am so disillusioned with this plane of existence now i view most people as NPCs rather than humans. The presence of other people make me deeply disturbed as if a otherworldly entity is looming over me. I view literally no purpose for this life, history and experience has taught me life is horrific suffering interrupted by small windows of contentedness.

Suic-270,Broken system,Why is the mental health system such a mess. After a very serious sucide attempt I woke up in hospital and then dumped straight onto a mental health unit with barely any interactions from staff just given sedation till they washed their hands of me. Sent to another unit with similar outcome. I had been diagnosed with MDD and PTSD. Then I had some chick prance through my room with 20 odd questions and then I was told I was BPD. I don't meet the criteria and was then told they are finished with me and by the way if you have a crisis just ring triage!! I cracked it and stopped all my medications which I don't think were doing much and now I'm totally going down the rabbit hole. My GP is a joke ( hasn't once asked about my mental health or sucide attempt) I dont have a shrink so I suppose if they don't care why should I?,Scrabbling ,Community Member,04-10-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/broken-system/td-p/575861

Suic-272,"My mum has had suicidal ""jokes""","Several months ago, mum made a joke about going to sleep and never wanting to wake up. Now I've had suicidal thoughts myself in the past, so it triggered me. I rang my brother for help, but he just suggested I stick her in a nursing home using my power of attorney. I sent an email to her GP to chase it up. In the depths of her drinking and despair, she would often say these things with sincerity, but now that I've followed up on them, she says it was just all a joke. She now resents me because she has to see her GP about it, which she's not looking forward to. For hours today, we argued about it, because she simply doesn't accept the trauma that it invoked within me. Eventually, I stopped her by going into detail what my thoughts were many years ago. She never realised. But even now, after discussing the trauma that it invokes inside me, she still doesn't respect my ""mental boundaries"". After all, everyone she's spoken to sees it as a joke. But none of those people have had suicidal thoughts in their past. So my question, is who's problem is it to deal with? Mine, to stop over-reacting to such comments when she's balling her eyes out and has lost all will to live. Or hers, to respect my sensitive nature. If I was a bit more thick-skinned, I may not have reported her behaviour to her GP. She is 77 and severely depressed and even though I am getting counselling which is helping, leans on me an incredible amount during her cancer treatment. I've tried to explain to her that it's a bit like a reformed alcoholic sitting in a bar, or a reformed smoker sitting amongst other smokers. To me, it's just not acceptable behaviour.",David35,Community Member,30-09-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,12,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/my-mum-has-had-suicidal-quot-jokes-quot/td-p/575526

Suic-274,Scared of Relapsing and Attempting Again.,"Hi. I've never posted here before but I'm desperate. These past few months I've made everyone think I'm doing mentally okay again, but it's far from true. I've been struggling with thoughts, and honestly the only thing stopping me is the fact that if I survive this one (would be my 6th or 7th within a year) everyone would be so angry with me, particularly my mother. I'm 18, and I've struggled with mental health my whole life just about. I love my family, my best friend and boyfriend, but I can't deal with any of this. I can't even really tell my therapist because of the whole 'duty of care' policy. I don't need everyone finding out I'm thinking like this again. I can't really talk about this stuff with anyone other than my therapist either, but even then I don't really tell her everything. I tell her the truth, but it's truths that don't matter. I tell her I'm disturbed, but I just use something I've already told her as my reasoning. I couldn't tell anyone the real reasons. Obviously I won't disclose them here, but my god, I'm just struggling to survive at this point. I'm so good at pretending nothing's wrong, but I can only do this for so much longer. Every day I hold on to these secrets I promised would die with me, the more i lose sight of why I'm here. I'm running out of reasons to stay. Everyone uses love as a reason, and as much as I love my family and that, I'm not entirely sure love is enough to save a wreck like me. I like such an attention seeker; posting shit like this isn't me (like at all), but I have nowhere else to turn. I know I need to tell my therapist but as I said, DOC exists and I've been burned like that before. I'm begging for help.

Suic-277,Why am i doing this to myself,"Hey all, about a week ago i lost an extremely close mate to suicide due to him being really depressed and always being put down. This had really hit me extremely hard and killed me on the inside. A few days later i lost a very very close family friend to unknown course during the night. We had the funeral recently and that day really hurt me deep down. I tried to just kms to just end the pain and suffering i had gone through for the last several years but I couldn't lose my GF and I didnt want to take the easy way out. Then on Friday i went out and purchased a lot of alcohol. Friday i started to drink a few here and there then on Saturday everything was to much and i just drank 1 after the other. At about 9pm that night i texted my GF saying that i never want to talk to her nor see her ever again and shes fat. None of this is true, she is the most amazing, beautiful, kind hearted and caring person you could ever imagine. I love her so so so deeply you dont understand. Sunday I spoke to her and i read all the messages i had sent and if im honest after reading them i didnt even want to talk to myself. It hurt that much with everything i had said all because i decided to drink. Everyday i have tried and tried to talk to her and shes responded here and there then earlier today she called me and i broke down instantly. I honestly thought she never wanted to even speak to me ever again but she did, after everything i had said and done, after all the emotions i killed. She still wanted to talk and i tell you that talk was the most emotional talk i have had in a long time. I know that she still doesnt quite want to talk to me and thats understandable and im honestly just hoping we will be able to have the good chats and laughs like we use to.

Suic-278,I’m so lonely right now,"Right now I have felt so lonely. My friends have been hating on me lately of what I did to one of my friend’s . Couple of weeks ago, I told a school councillor about my friend that I was worried about. I have been worried about her for a long time because she selfs harms a lot and I couldn’t bare knowing this info and something bad happening and I didn’t do anything about it. She has been in denial of whole thing and she always says that she is fine, which I know her so well that she was definitely not fine. My other best friend agreed with me that she needed help and that we didn’t want anything to happen , so we agreed to tell someone we trusted. We decided to have a talk about our concerns about our friend and tell her that we supported her, I mentioned that both of us will have to tell someone because we are worried about u. Having past mental health problems I knew that getting help was the right thing to do and it helps so much, but after I mentioned it to my friend who was struggling, my other best friend who supported me with my choices said , she didn’t agree on telling someone about this and she said that she wouldn’t support me if I went through with this.Anyway couple days later got more advice from other close friends and they 100% agreed on telling someone about it and that it is the right thing to do , even if she hates u afterwards , it could save her life. Anyway I told the school councillor about everything going on, they said that they would talk to her , ring the parents up and take further action from there. They said to tell her to give her the heads up instead of just surprising her with this info. Me and my other close friends approached her and told her everything and we mentioned things on why we did this like it’s because we love u so much and can’t bare the thought of something bad happening,that’s why we did this etc. she went silent and was chill to my surprise but I could tell she was upset and mad. After going back to class , my friend who was struggling with self harm, yelled out to my friend who claimed that she would support me with trying to get our other friend help, and said “they told”, my friend approached the struggling one and said “how dare they, they are terrible friends.” I knew after that, that she didn’t want to help my struggling friend , she was using this to get closer to my other friend because she was always jealous with how close we were.Now none of my friends are talking to me and have left me on opened on everything because I did a terrible thing, they are acting like I don’t exist and that I was never friends with them.it was one of the hardest things I have had to do, but I knew it was the right thing , but now I have zero friends so I feel so lonely and I feel like no one even cared about me. Other people are telling me that she will realise that u were the good friend and that ur friend will forgive u , but it doesn’t feel like it ,and now I’m on school holidays so everyone is hanging out and I’m just home alone , bored shitless and waiting for the days to finish and sometimes I just want to disappear because I feel like no one will ever love me like I love everybody else.

He was the one in my family who made me feel included and that I belonged there and now with him gone I feel so alone. The suicidal thoughts (which I’ve had in the past) are now creeping in! I would I hope never act on them as I have lost my youngest sons dad 11 years ago as well and he has no one if I was to leave too but to be honest that’s probably the only thing keeping me here. My sisters promised to include me more but that has not happened in the end. My mum is grieving herself and doesn’t seem to want me around she actively seeks others out before me yet me being there for her most of the time ! Dad taught me family is the thing that matters the most so I’m trying so hard to be there but I just feel so alone! I understand everyone is grieving but it was like this before he passed. When dad passed my relationship got better with my oldest son (20 he long story but after youngest sons dad died I gave my older three boys to their dad as I was grieving so hard and he feels like I abandoned him which I understand) but yesterday he hugged my mum and didn’t even say hello to me ! That broke my heart as I thought we’d made progress! My anxiety lately is debilitating I can’t seem to do the simple things I feel so stuck. I feel like I can’t breathe properly and I struggle to put one foot in front of the other ! I have complex PTSD and have worked so hard to be a better person and I have been the best mentally up until dad died I have ever been ! I’d have my bad days but they wouldn’t take me as long to manage . I just feel like I don’t matter my feelings don’t matter I’m not wanted and I’ll never be enough for anyone. I feel like everyone would be better off without me and I feel like I’m just a hindrance! Again I’d never act on these feelings my youngest son is enough to pull me through anything and I know if that wasn’t going to pull me through it I would get more help! I have a psych appointment tomorrow but this is a new psych and I’m feeling like he isn’t getting me however I’m going to give it one more shot before I stop ! I have a lot of health issues (heart and stomach ) and I can’t even get in to see the dr for mental health plans as a single mum on jobseeker I can’t afford to go see one.

Suic-293,Suicidal constantly,Hi all. Like others I think of suicide basically constantly. It's like a someone whispering in me ear that I can't stop as my life otherwise is (mostly) ok. I told my parents again but they just said Im an attention seeker that using it as an excuse not to work. That is far from the trust as when I tell them I'm suicidal they laugh and then get angry. It's so difficult as it makes my suicidal thoughts worse but they seem completely oblivious. Anyway stay safe all.

Suic-295,Do I deserve it or is my mum the asshole,"So since about a year and a half ago, I started having a quicker mouth, and it would run at the worst of times but I think I've gotten better with it and I've had fam and friends agree but my mum still says everything I say is extremely rude, or out of line, and if I make a joke about my grandmother, because thats our family, we make fun of each other, she will laugh but usually my grandma will get offended. Then my mum will yell at me for about 10 minutes which I think is unfair, and she always sides with my grandma no matter what. She often tells me to go blank myself, die, or ""I hate you"" (1st time she said it I was abt 8 and left sobbing in the driveway). I'm extremely quick witted but sarcastic at the same time which gets me into trouble sometimes but its to almost anything I say. No matter what its rude or insincere or disrespectful, or I'm talking like she's a piece of crap on my shoe. Everything I say is in a joking manner but clearly I think my voice sounds like something else because its almost always rude, even though no one else says it. I've given up trying to compliment her or family because it apparently just sound insincere but whenever she asks my opinion and I give my honest answer she yells at me because it was to blunt. I've given up trying to help around the house because I always do it wrong resulting in her screaming at me for ages, and me saying some dumb crap back at her. I've been diagnosed with depression by my GP but they are refusing to give me antidepressants because they say I'm too young (I'm 12) ad they're trying to refer to me a 1000 dollar psyc but ik we can't afford it so I'm making my mum not do it. I think my mum hates me, because she doesn't try to engage in conversation gets pissed if I try and show her a video, doesn't seem interested if I tell her about my life, but then gets mad at me if I don't tell her. So am I rude, and the creep who deserves it because I'm rude or is my mum dramatic/ toxic",Marnay21,Community Member,02-08-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/do-i-deserve-it-or-is-my-mum-the-asshole/td-p/571544
Suic-296,Feeling alone,These days life just seems like such a struggle… I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and cptsd but I also think I could be struggling with ocd too. I have a psychologist who I’v been seeing for about 2 years she’s helpful but I just don’t think therapy is enough support… some days I seriously feel like just dying. If I had the opportunity I will probably take the opportunity to kill myself the only thing stopping me is my family and how much of an effect that would have on them. I’m trying my best to keep my head above water but shits hard. I’m trying to find a psychiatrist but the waiting process is so long I think I have to wait about 3 months and it’s super costly too… I’m a uni student so I’m barely making much either. Also I’ve taken some sick days from work because of my mental health and my manager is beginning to get mad at me… she doesn’t have any context to how I’m feeling so I get that and she needs workers to show up but I can’t rn. I feel like a let the whole team down…. I could bring it up to her but there’s a lot of stigma surrounding mental health so I’m just a bit scared… confused and lost I hope someone can share some words of encouragement,Mysweetpiano761,Community Member,01-08-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/feeling-alone/td-p/571458

Suic-298,Body dysmorphia or just plain ugly?,"The mental health issues I struggle with a many and almost overwhelming and go back to events in the childhood - could not cover it all right here! One of the biggest hurdles for me has been how people regard me, physically.I always seem to repulse people. I don't have to open my mouth or do anything to be abused... so from early childhood I realised it was my looks. I was bullied at school for my appearance and weight. I (still, at 50!) struggle with the mental effects of eating disorders, disorders that were NOT treated (except with punishment, humiliation and abuse in the family).The facts say I am ugly.I also know that when I see my reflection I see a monster and I avoid ALL social situations, hardly leaving the house because I just don't want to upset people with my hideousness. I have been abused by blokes (mainly, although women also express their disgust) in public places too many times to remember.So, I am ugly. I also know that my symptoms and experience is related to body dysmorphia and the related issues to the eating disorders I battle. In spite of these experiences and feelings, I have never been formally diagnosed with bd. I suspect that psychiatric professionals see ugly people as unable to also experiencing bd... I mean, such people ARE ugly so the fact they feel monstrous is only natural and not a real psychological problem. Some medical professionals seem to think I'm fishing for compliments. Male practicioners will not tough the issue with a ten foot pole.This stigma is real. I suffer every day - frequently leading to suicidal ideas (and past attempts) and thoughts of mutilation. I may be seen as ugly scum by society - ugly females are absolutely not welcome in this world - so, are these abusers and (what I consider) neglectful professionals right? Are these feelings just the natural and deserving punishment for not being 'easy on the eye', or can an ugly person experience body dysmorphia as much as a normal person?",Moonbeamer,Community Member,01-08-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/body-dysmorphia-or-just-plain-ugly/td-p/571474
Suic-299,My life is one hurdle after another,"I'm not sure how much more of my life I can truly take. I'm not exaggerating when I say that nothing goes right for me. Despite my best efforts, and doing my best to be kind, empathetic and generous to others, the world just craps on me time after time. I don't have any money, I don't have a job, and I'm facing homelessness. The only thing worth living for is my daughter. If I didn't have her, I would literally have no reason to be here. I feel like I'm a burden, a drain on everyone else (including my poor daughter), and just useless. This has been my life for years. Nothing changes, nothing improves, it's just one letdown or challenge after another. I had a job - a good job - and because I couldn't live up to the boss's expectations, they let me go. I decided to apply for a government program, and after fighting for my spot I was accepted on the proviso that I have a mentor. I have tried and start my own business, but I have no customers, my mentor has never been in contact with me. I leave messages, I send emails - nothing. Then, last week, I was thrown off the program because of ""non-participation"" and because I hadn't managed to reach my goals (get customers, basically). I tried, I really did, but nothing ever happened. It's like I was invisible. I had to sell my apartment. I started looking for another apartment before I put mine on the market, so I knew there were places out there. My place sold quickly, but for a lot less than I paid, and now I'm desperately looking for a new place, but the real estate agents ignore my calls and emails, my conveyancer does the same, and I don't have access to the money I've made from the sale because it's with the conveyancer. In a couple of weeks I will need to move out, and I have nowhere to go. I just feel like no-one can see me, or hear me. I often wonder if I'm imagining things - like I'm not really here and it's all a dream. But it's not. This is my life. My would I want to live in a world where no-one can see me, or hear me? Where I'm invisible, and hopeless?

I have depression and anxiety, and also undiagnosed ADHD. I found that I may have ADHD during my therapy sessions and it has only been a couple months since I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. In the recent weeks, I've started to think of death as an option. Like a worst case option. Im in a really bad personal and family financial situation and my parents are going through a divorce. Whenever I think of the worst that could happen, I have started to assure myself that in a worst case scenario, death is an option. I don't even think about my dog when I think these thoughts, despite knowing that I am all my dog has. I have never had these thoughts before. Sure, I have thought about death, but have always brushed it off because I knew it was not an option, but now it's different. I haven't told my psychologist about this because I didn't know how to.

Suic-302,Anxiety,"Hello All, I'm 37. I never used to be like this. I never suffered anxiety like this before in my life. It has gotten worse with age. Everyday, I'm anxious about work, social anxiety, anxious about my neighbours, for some strange reason, I've been anxious that someone is gonna complain against me and sue me, for God knows what. I'm always scared that I'm gonna be in legal trouble for something, even though I'm not doing anything wrong. I literally have no idea how this all started. I did try 2wice in my late teens/early adulthood to suicide, but that was a long time ago. I'll get anxious about tiny things that most people wouldn't even be anxious for. For some reason, I always feel like, or think that people around me are talking about me negatively, and that it's gonna come back on me somehow. I know that I'm not the only one going through this, but most days, I just wanna crawl into a hole somewhere and live away, and live in peace. I am back to suicidal ideation, but at this stage, that's all it is, ideation. I even tell my husband that I'm gonna kill myself, and himself being anxious, it makes his anxiety worse. I literally don't understand how this all started. Sometimes something will trigger me, and I'll start getting anxious, then angry. I feel like this world is too much for me. It really does feel that way. Every day I wake up, hoping something happens to me, but it never does. When I turn on the news, and I see all these tragedies happen, I sometimes ask God why that wasn't me? Why can't God just take me, and give me respite? I even have gone so far as to make a decision, that if I was ever diagnosed with something serious, and life threatening like cancer, I'd just leave it be, and let myself waste away. That's how bad I'm feeling. Sometimes I think about getting mugged and killed, or held up. I always tell myself, that if ever someone pointed a gun at me, or knifed me, I'd put my hands up and tell them to do me the favour, and go ahead. 'take what you want, go ahead, do me a favour, I don't care'. I literally wake up despairing, hating having to go to work, hating everything. I even would go so far, as to hate people. It's just so bizarre behaviour, but it's literally my reality. If someone else could validate what I'm feeling, and tell me I'm not alone, that would be nice to know it's not just me.",Mozaik,Community Member,29-07-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/anxiety/td-p/571252
Suic-303,Your greatest promise with suicidal thoughts and/or self harm. TRIGGER WARNING,"Some time ago I wrote about acceptance whether it was our biggest challenge see link. That was in view of accepting our mental health issues, a goal you would want to reach whereby you have all things in place- diagnosis, medication, therapy and lifestyle. A point in the process where you are living your life the best you can as functionally as you can, as close to normal as you can get considering that huge hand you've been dealt. Acceptance at this level is great because you have accepted your lack of some capabilities under extreme conditions.. Great! But rarely is it achieved hence the title of the greatest challenge. https://forums.beyondblue.org.au/t5/staying-well/acceptance-is-this-our-biggest-challenge/td-p/147694 Then there was the theory of switching our mind in thought, to do the opposite of a physical need, like needing to go for a walk and instead we remain lying on the lounge. To do the opposite of what our brain is telling us to do is sometimes beneficial. It takes training, practice and determination, see link. https://forums.beyondblue.org.au/t5/staying-well/switching-mindsets/td-p/274532 Combine the above together for your greatest challenge- the realisation that you need help with suicidal thought or mental crisis - to not remain in a ""it will pass"" state of mind... To get help no matter what you are thinking at the time, if you are thinking of or acting out self harm, having suicidal thoughts regardless of what level of seriousness, even if you do not believe you are a threat to yourself WHEN THE TEARS START FALLING COMBINED WITH FEELINGS OF HOPELESSNESS PLEASE SEEK HELP NO MATTER HOW OFTEN. In my experience of hundreds of such episodes I believe all such episodes are a short step from making that one action of attempt, I'm not mincing words, I'm trying to accurately describe the sad, horrifying place that ouR state of mind exists in that zone of depression. Many of you know where that place is. On one occasion only I took it to another level and will never go there again and now I will get help every time, it's my pledge., my promise to myself. Yes, our greatest challenge is very simple. Tell a loved one you feel you are in danger and ask them to contact someone be it suicide watch 131114 Beyondblue 1300 224 636 or ambulance.

Suic-306,Is anyone particularly upset about dealing with ‘cognitive defects’?,"I have been struggling with cognitive defects throughout my life, such as lack of attention, lack of awareness of surroundings/directions, slow processing speed, forgetfulness, slower learning abilities & poor social skills. I am managing to keep my streams of income, and more feedback is good, however a lot of services seem indifferent about whether or not they have me working for them. I’ve been given negative feedback a few times about my lack of interactions and some people seem to have a problem with me not knowing what has been said/shown to me right away or for not remembering. When I’m in a situation where I’m unsure about something or someone points something out to me when I wanted to figure it out in my own time & way, it upsets me tremendously, to the point of feeling worthless, cognitively defective & sometimes to the point of suicidal feelings in which I contemplate the point of existing, why my parents had me, why I wasn’t euthanised or murdered & whether I am a waste of space. These feelings are somewhat temporary & occasional but they can be triggered in similar circumstances. Cognitive defects are the worst of issues I’ve dealt with as they may very well be permanent and they are ongoing and detrimental to my self-worth and happiness.

Suic-311,Bipolar Diagnosis and Treatment,"Hi. I've been with beyondblue for about 10 years. I myself am diagnosed with PTSD, Depression and Anxiety issues. I recently married and found out my wife has a severe form of depression and anxiety. To the point she has suicidal thoughts, sits in the corner of a dark room rocking back and forth crying, will throw tantrums on the floor, and generally cannot be talked to whilst she is going through these moments. When she is done usually many hours later or the following day she will apologise profusely and say that was not her saying and doing all those things. It has happened in hotels, shopping centres, and in the street. Grabbing hold of me dragging herself on the ground. When she is having an episode in a room I try and talk to her and to calm her down and ask what's going on, but she grabs hold of me and won't get out of my personal space. This is where additional problems lie. With my anxiety issues and PTSD I can't stand someone to be in my personal space generally not letting me get away. It flicks a switch in me. I just want to be left alone when this is happening. But you can imagine being late at night in a hotel in a foreign country you have nowhere to go and don't really want to leave her alone at the same time in case she harms herself. My psychiatrist has advised that I walk away from her no matter where I am. It's easier said than done though. One time it happened while I was driving. She remained suicidal and full of blame about me treating her poorly and leaving her in the middle of nowhere. I can't win. So after that very long introduction, my thoughts are that she has severe bipolar. Maybe some people can help chime in if I am incorrect. Not a medical diagnosis I know but she will not go to a medical professional because her culture deems it inappropriate to do so. And I can't force her. Is there anyone with my similar PTSD etc condition that has had to deal with a Bipolar person.

I'm so afraid of rejection I go to these great lengths to try and talk to people but it just ends up being so toxic and so weird. Some things I done I feel like I can't live with. I feel like I'm just going to go to hell anyway so what's the harm in doing that now? If I feel guilty and miserable now I may as well not live like this for the rest of my life. Plus I just feel like I can't tell anyone about it because these are just ideations for me, not plans and that will freak people out. I'm a really kind and caring person, I care a lot about people, but all this mental health shit going on in my head has made me make some really fucking stupid decisions. I'm my own worst enemy. I just can't live with it. I have gotten better over the past few years but I still do stuff like this. I've always thought I'm going to be someone who dies young...

Suic-315,I’m not really sure..,"Hi everyone, I suffered a spinal injury playing footy almost a year ago now, as well as my spine I got a concussion which has also lasted a year too. I got kicked out of my school as I wasn’t fit enough to be there and my friends would constantly say I’m faking it just because it isn’t a visible injury. I’ve had teachers bully me and humiliate me infront of my class, yes I am under the age of 18 but I really need someone to talk to and didn’t know how else to get it. For the first 6 months of my injury I was in a dark room and did nothing but sleep and eat after that I went to school but only for a max of an hour about twice a week. I wasn’t getting the right help and no one referred us to the right doctor.I am now at a children’s hospital going through rehab but I’m struggling to be motivated to do anything and I’m constantly nauseous, light headed and have blurred vision. I have my suicide note and tried to kill myself last year on December the 26th but told no one about it, not even my family. I’ve always had those thoughts lingering in my head and they come every now and then. I haven’t taken any medication but I’ve never thought of it as depression just as being sad.",idRK02p4,Community Member,06-07-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-m-not-really-sure/td-p/569600
Suic-316,How much more can a mother take when her child has suicided,"Hi, I’m not really sure why Ive decided to write on this forum. No one can truly heal me so maybe I’m after some unbiased help.My 22 year old daughter left us nearly 2 yrs ago. Her suicidewas very public, inappropriately placed and completely devastating. I am here to ask for non religious sensible, unbiased help and advice. 868 days ago I became a broken, shattered person that feels those 868 days as if I’m back at day 1. I have seen psychologists,psychiatrists,councillors,paid for 2 therapists,1 living in America and the other in Canada and attended a 6 week grief course. I never once thought there was anything bad enough to make me feel the way I do and the silly thing is there’s no cure. No amount of pills will make me forget her, no amount of counseling can fix my broken heart and no matter how hard I cry/beg/scream I have to acknowledge my baby is never coming home and there will be no new memories that include her physically by my side. Im struggling with depression and anxiety and am out of ideas on how to help myself learn to adapt to this new me. I’m drowning in regret, guilt and mental pain. My friends/family all see me as an incredibly strong person that is handling this situation with poise and dignity but behind my closed office door or in the shower I’m a mental mess and I don’t know how to get past feeling like this. The man she was seeing on the night of her death was her narcissistic boss, her narcissistic boyfriend and was 30 narcissistic years older than her. Can a narcissist push someone to suicide if they’ve got a history but has made the decision to turn a corner and see a suicide councillor and a therapist? I believe with all my heart he coerced her into killing herself as she was emotionally unstable and would have been an easy target. I have handwritten notes from her relaying things he would say to her, to encourage her to kill herself. Any advice would be appreciated as I hate living like this.",Donella,Community Member,06-07-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,5,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/how-much-more-can-a-mother-take-when-her-child-has-suicided/td-p/569620
Suic-317,It’s all falling down,"I’ve been suffering with all kinds of symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts for most of my adult life (30 yrs old) I suffered through severe bullying during my school years which have haunted me into my adult life, I’ve struggled with making friends due to trust issues and being able to make real connections with people, I have only my Mother who has always been there for me when everyone else has abandoned me. through all these years I made a block point in my mind even if everything gets to difficult I couldn’t hurt myself as i know the impact it will leave for her, but it’s at a point we’re I feel It’s just not worth it. I am going through a really bad part now, I’ve struggled with keeping my career on track due to how one minute I can see glimpses of happiness then next minute I can barely function, I fear what’s going to happen tomorrow and what people think of me, I feel like I everyone talks about me behind my back and it leaves me feeling sick. I’ve kept all of these feelings tucked away for many years but in recent years I told my mother as it was becoming apparent when I’d sit and stare at nothing and barely speak, I’m sure someone out there knows what it’s like to just sit there and disconnect mentally, sometimes it feels like I won’t come back mentally. i have sought help from numerous GPS and psychologists but it’s never helped I can’t get across to them how I can go from mild happiness to patiently waiting for the unfortunate time when my mother will pass and I’m left with nothing. All I’ve wanted is some peace for this time but now I’m stressing my mother too much with me telling her these things, I realise now you only get help when you do something. I want to disconnect myself from society, be put away and forgotten about functioning is getting to hard now. I never thought I’d be thinking about self harm but I was this morning… I could do it again, it feels like this is the only way to wake myself up, it’s like self expression. I came on here some years ago when it wasn’t this bad and was recommended seeking help, that never helped, I’ve called the hotlines but that’s just a band-aid. Is it almost time?

In my 67 years I think I had suicidal thoughts hundreds of times. Every time I reversed it- how is this done? Here as some ways- Time. In the depth of sadness taking time to pass by as there is ""no rush to escape the demons""Breathe. Take long deep breaths, hold them when out and in for several seconds. Appreciate that action, you can breath, it is a wonder, a giftMove. Get up and walk up the street and back. Dont go far, your absence will be painful for othersLove. Let yourself love you. Appreciate. It's ok, it is all ok.Cry. Let it out. Changes. Once recovered alter your life with survival in mind. Employment, environment, toxic people, follow your dreams and seek out your true selfSeek help. You know you need it. Find the help you deserve. We arent super human.Pluck a comment that's positive. For me it was from my dad before my attempt- ""better to be the best part time dad than no dad at all""Rest. Calm yourself, rest, reflect and gather what is valuable in your life. Suicide path is a hard road to walk, it hurts, its sad and its emotional. It can be devastating for family and friends. Action. What ever it takes. Any other road you take is better than the alternative you have considered.It's ok. it's all ok. Talk. Seek out you chosen professional. Chat away. Follow the road to recovery.

I’ve tried to get a psychiatrist appointment to adjust my meds but now I’m on a three month wait list to get an appointment. I don’t know if I can make it until then. Everyday my inner monologue in a constant mantra or suicidal thoughts. I am barely keeping myself together at work and am having panic attacks regularly. On top of that I’m constantly stressed about finances and paying rent on time that everything seems useless. I barely have any close friends and I can’t see anyone wanting to be in a relationship with me. I don’t enjoying doing anything anymore and I feel so tired all the time. I’ve been self harming because it’s the only thing that makes me feel in control. I feel so lost and like a massive failure. Is this all my life is supposed to be?

I have a previous history of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, attempting suicide, mental health diagnosis (BPD - Boderline Personality Disorder), physical health problem such as right ankle tibia fracture due to sucide attempt, skin graft because of potential risks of developing cancer on the surged area (right leg - metal plates and screws placed on 01 Sep 2021), a major accident - 2 days extreme verge of homelessness due to my mother's ruthless actions towards me (i fell down the same day at school - fainted and experienced seizures in which I had hitv my head, leg and arm multiple times which might have resulted the metal plates in my right ankle to twist making it difficult for me to walk now, my head is in a bad state - by which I mean that it is constantly stinging and aching, my left wrist is undergoing horrible pain at the moment as well.

Suic-333,Needing encouragement,"June 19, 2020 I attempted suicide. I didn't/don't want to be in pain anymore. That date is coming up soon and it's triggering me. I've tried so damn much since then to rebuild my health, mind and willpower. But my mind is fragmented into a thousand pieces. A lifetime of chronic headaches/migraines. They can be over 15+ days in a month. They can last anywhere from 2 to 16 hours. I was born missing supportive bones on one side of my neck. There's no cure, only manageability. I've had chronic fatigue and depression for 20 years. Tried all the things. My son is 3.5yrs old. He's my heart. I love him so damn much and love being his dad. It's the only reason I keep fighting through this continuous pain cycle. It's torturous. I don't want to be in pain anymore. But I don't want to leave my boy fatherless. So each day I'm crushed between those opposing forces. It took 15 years of mental degradation to attempt my life. It's been nearly 3 years since then. I've been diligent in trying to repair my mind and willpower. 100+hrs of clinical psychology, mindfulness, meditation, exercise, diet, drugs, no drugs, western medicine, eastern medicine and so on. I don't think there's a option I haven't tried. I'm tired. The journey to some semblance of sustainable health is always out of reach. Everytime I make progress it gets taken from me. I can't leave my son without his dad. But I also don't want to be in pain. I feel trapped physically and emotionally. Looping the same loops. My family knows my story. They are immensely supportive. I'm not in danger but I am in mental turmoil. Each setback shatters me and I have to rebuild again and again.

So I'm not sure where to start to be honest, ok I'm currently in year 12 at school and I am more of a practical learner, so I don't do well with school, and hence why I do not want to go to uni. Last year my dog who had been my best friend all my life, she lived over 18 years so she has still been on this planet longer than me, and I am not excited to turn 18 because of that, she passed away, we had to put her down, and words cannot describe the grief I am feeling and the guilt. Then we go a new puppy, but it was too soon for me. when my dog left us, that's the first time I ever hurt myself, I felt guilty because she could have lived more, but she had dementia and a lot of problems, so she would have been in pain and unhappy. Grief has and is hitting me hard, I have never experienced it like this, with someone so close, it hurts, it really does, and because of this grief, lately I haven't been able to concentrate in class, connect with family, I haven't been eating properly, I haven't been sleeping well (clearly because I'm writing this at like midnight), so I'm all out of wack, and it's not just the grief... school and friends have always been an escape for me, escape from home and my responsibilities of being the eldest daughter amongst 3 younger brothers. Lately, well it's gone on for a while now but I came to this school in year 10, and have an amazing group of friends, but there is one person in particular who doesn't like me, and because of that I have been left out of things, have been talked about behind my back, and I have tried so hard to connect with this person, but they don't seem to care, and I just felt worthless, so this was the second time I hurt myself. Recently, family has been hard to deal with, teenage boys suck and they don't get anything done, and the eldest gets blamed obviously, and they just don't understand you in general. And stuff has come up recently with other family stuff, so my youngest brother is actually my 4-year-old half-brother, and my ex step dad I guess, we had to deal with family violence with him and it wasn't fun, and stuff has come up where child protection services have had to step in again, I'm about to run out of words so...Thank you for reading my vent, feel free to offer any advice you may have, vent here, or just say hi -lil quirky",lil quirky,Community Member,02-06-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/vent-about-life-currently-feel-free-to-read/td-p/566893

I can't think straight. I have a constant bad headache and my heart is racing. I've been trying to ring Centrelink all morning and the computerised system kept hanging up on me. I finally got put on hold and it's been more than 1 and a half hours already and still, that horrible music is playing and I dare not hang up. I'm just feeling like what's the point of anything? I'm old, can't find work, and can't understand the paperwork I must fill out. I need exact date statements from my bank, showing my exact bank balances on that day last year, and the bank won't help me they will only give me the regular 3 monthly statements. The bank just laughed and said yes can't do it, I said Centrelink is demanding them and they said yes Centrelink is like that, we can't help you. I need help to fill out paperwork but I can't imagine anyone that could help me. I don't have friends or anything. Someone said that Centrelink is there to help you. I don't feel that's true. Because of the mistakes they say I have made, I fear I am going to be cut off and have a large debt to pay because these papers were from last year and it took them this long to query them.",Smb81,Community Member,29-05-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,5,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-can-t-get-an-appointment-with-my-doctor/td-p/566552
Suic-343,Am I actually depressed or just sad/attention seeking,"Hi For roughly the past 2 years (I don't remember exactly when it started) I think I have been feeling depressed. Generally, I ignore the feelings of sadness and push them down until something triggers them again. The only problem with this is I think I'm just looking for attention, instead of actually being depressed and I want someone to take notice of me for once. When I'm around my friends, I laugh and make jokes and I think I feel happy yet I still feel empty inside. The depression comes in waves almost, as in I'm fine one day then crappy the next, and have the most suicidal, self-degrading thoughts ever. Everything feels like it's just going to go straight down the toilet so I just don't try for anything anymore. Because of this, my grades have dropped and my mum yells at me about how ""useless"" I am and how I'm ""wasting my talents"" as I used to be relatively smart. (Dad isn't in the picture in case you are wondering). I'm sad so much that it physically hurts inside, as in my chest will tighten and my heart aches. But then if I google ""depression symptoms"" only one or two of the symptoms match what I feel so am I genuinely depressed or just sad and wanting attention?",Marnay21,Community Member,29-05-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,6,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/am-i-actually-depressed-or-just-sad-attention-seeking/td-p/566585

Suic-350,"Anhedonia from herbal remedy, really struggling. TW","I have been through a devastating journey with chronic illness, and LONG story short I'd realized that a herbal supplement was worsening all that I was trying to help. Unfortunately one of these symptoms is apathy/anhedonia. I have been off the stuff for 4 months and nearly 3 weeks now and although it's improving each week I still can't feel my emotions and am dissociative.It's not just the 4 months, I've been suffering from this and the chronic illness for nearly 2 years, so for a huge portion of my life now (I am 30 and want to be living my life) I have been unable to feel music properly, or dance, feel truly connected to nature or people. And no one understands because it's such a specific affliction. I have in the past been emotionally numb from cptsd/mental illness and zero coping skills, SSRI's to a degree, and even from illicit drugs, but this effect is not being caused by my thinking, because it is known to affect the brain, gut, hormones etc. in ways that results in this symptom for some people. I have self harmed this month. It's improved a lot but it's at the point where I'm becoming so lucid I'm really losing my patience and am very aware of how much I have missed out on in life through all this time. I still feel disconnected and am finding it hard to reconnect with friends, I don't have many close friends, and even the ones I am closer to it's sometimes still been really hard to be social. It has been and it's going to be a real effort to get back into community and taking initiative to make new friends + start nurturing friendships again. I am sick of this life, and I know I've learned a lot and I've made it this far and finally am pulling through but I feel so upset by how my life has felt like a vacuum. It's so non linear daily I keep feeling like the rug is being pulled from underneath me, ever since I self harmed a couple weeks ago I keep thinking about doing it again (I cant even drink alcohol etc, not even coffee right now). I just feel so isolated, and mentally exhausted. I don't want to lose hope and I keep wanting to self harm again. I feel at my wits end. Most of what I do is just walk, cycle, or run, and on a good week do one social thing in my small routine as I finish a short course to get work. Life just ""feels"" bleak at the moment.

His illness got so bad at a certain point that he would deficate laying down and I was physically lifting him up. So he was put down.

Suic-361,Involuntary Mental Ward,"I went into hospital thinking I would have liver surgery, I had sleep deprivation, constipation and hemorrhoids, a bleeding liver for several days. They sent me to the mental ward. I was seeing things and hearing things not there temporarily and is common with sleep deprivation. They gave me medication without my knowledge I thought it would help then they gave me an injection which gave me a back blood clot for a while and some blurry vision but worst of all it gave me akathisia causing more sleep deprivation after I had it solved, still don't know about my liver but the blood stopped for now. When I went home finally my akathisia made me call 000 and for a bad back. After a gruelling trip they gave me medication then sent me back to the ward. I complained I couldn't sleep but they angrily told me to go back to bed right next to a troublemaker. In the ward the psychotic are tougher, they bully the quiet and even the traumatised there's no segregation. The Psychiatrist this time told he would give anti anxiety medication to help with my akathisia, when I went home and checked there was none. Another Doctor also said I had more white blood cells which could mean infection. First I rang up about the medication asking for it the second time about my white blood cell count. Shortly after a nurse from the Ward rings up saying I have to go back or she'll ring the police because I've been ringing up with too many problems. At tribunal they gave me the option to leave for good but with said demands or stay. I left because they always told me I could negotiate with the CTO that I could change the injection or even that I'm not Schizophrenic because I don't actually see things or hear voices. They didn't even look into it and on the 26th they will inject me with medication when my Akathisia hasn't healed fully. The withdrawal and even the injection itself has given me so many problems.

That plan will involve going to the hospital that has traumatised me. How can I have trust in a person I don’t know & who has links to the hospital that has traumatised me?

Suic-376,Feel betrayed,"I have been seeing a psychologist under a Mental Health Care Plan and on the 6th visit disclosed I was in aych emitional pain and had suicidal thoughts but no plans. The psych said he had to do a report to my gp for extra funding and asked how I felt about him mentioning the thoughts. I told him I had a poor relationship with my gp and needed to find another as I didn't feel he was interested in my depression. So basically gave the impression I didn't want that divulged. When I saw my gp he started quizzing me about my disclosure to the osych and I felt really uncomfortable and ambushed as I thought I had made it clear to the psych I did not have that sort of relationship with my gp. . The gp said the psych thought it was""ambiguous ideation"" I think he called it. So if that is so, why did my therapist divulge this to someone I didn't feel comfortable with? Is this a breach of confidentiality? The psych didn't discuss safety plans or anything and my next psych appt was not for 3 weeks so he obviously was not too worried. I feel betrayed by my psych and I felt I had to endure a really excruciating discussion with my gp and niw I am embarassed ti go back to the gp. Now I don't want to see my therapist again either. Did he breach confidentiality when there was no clear concern that I would do something and was really just speaking out of distress.? I also now don't want to engage with another therapist aa niw I don't trust that what I say will stay confidential and it took so much for me to even get to that point with this psych.",7592,Community Member,13-04-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/feel-betrayed/td-p/563241

Suic-378,First time ECT  by scrabbling,"Hi to all especially mmMeKitty, the Pages here have changed and I can no longer find our thread and I haven't got the tolerance to spend hours on my phone, so I hope you see this. as I said before the roller coaster has been at Full Speed and it finally came into the station which is Ward and I had to make a decision. I cannot keep going the way I am and the doctors have mentioned a few times in the last 6 months about ECT to be honest it absolutely bloody terrified me, I know we shouldn't assume but I think everyone has seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest!!! certainly didn't help people's perception. I have been drowning for a long time it's been like walking in a thick fog I was desensitized totally to life and unbearably sad and just wanted it all to stop, the staff here on ward have been fantastic and I had my first ECT yesterday I will be honest it wasn't a perfect run, my anxiety exploded as I am awful to cannulate at the best at times but when I'm stressed my veins disappear, so I think I was a bit like ""when you give a pill to a cat"" and you retrieve it off the curtains and off the back of the couch and from under the bed !!!! that was me, the staff were very patient and finally they managed to get a vein, I woke up with a minor headache and a little bit of shoulder blade soreness none that really wasn't sorted with some Panadol, I did have a sore neck later that night again that went away with just the hot shower, I can't speak for everybody and possibly may even sound stupid but after the treatment I had a snooze for a few hours and I did feel clearer and even if it was briefly a spark (excuse the pun) the old me made a breif appearance, yes the sadness came back in the afternoon and I'm sure I will be having a few more treatments but I had nearly forgotten the old me.

Suic-379,Can't take it anymore,"I have been married for 8 years to a man I loved for more than 3 years before marriage. From the very beginning of our marriage, he never liked my family because we are poor and unable to provide for dowry and jewellery for the wedding. I thought it was just a phase and it will be fine once I moved in with him. I moved from India to Australia with the promise of a better lifestyle leaving all my friends and family. Now I regret this as the worst decision of my life. He started slowly isolating me from my friends and family. I got a small job within a few months in the same company as him and tried to help my parents in clearing my student debt and dowry debt. He immediately freaked out and forbid me from maintaining any contact with my family and friends. This was because he got me the job and the money is technically his and I cannot spend them on my family. I still believed him and thought everything will be alright once we have kids. The actual trouble started from then as I insisted on both my parents come to Australia to help me with my child birth. The moment they came to our home, he started disrespecting them and started treating them like maids. During my daughter's 1st birthday, in laws started demanding for wedding jewelry and property my parents owned. A big fight happened between my dad ,my inlaws and my husband. I was forbid from maintaining any contact with them. Every bank transaction of mine were monitored. Finally It reached a point that he started spreading false stories about my parents. My parents lost their respect in the family and made them feel like culprits. My parents have disowned me now and I am also forbidden to attend their funerals. I lost everything in my life with no support from friends and family. I am suicidal thoughts for about 3 months from now and tried discussing this with my husband but the reply I got from him was "" let's get separated and then you go for suicide since you will no longer be my responsibility "". I realised I am just an insignificant part of his life who is an unpaid maid and nanny. I can't take it anymore. There is no Shoulder to cry on. He doesn't allow me access to a therapist.

Suic-390,I'm lost.,"I (20F) have been struggling with mental health ever since I can remember. My earliest memories I have of my life is me feeling unworthy and depressed because my dad left my mum before I was born and so my mum blamed me for him leaving her, my older brother and me. ""He didn't want you"", ""he wanted me to get an abortion because he never wanted a daughter"", ""he never loved any of us"" she would tell me, my earliest memory of this was aged 6 or 7. My father was never in my life until I was around 12, He sent me and my older brother a message on Facebook. A couple of months later he flew to Brisbane to see us both with his new girlfriend, we met at a Mcdonalds and sat and talked for a while. after that we kept in contact on Facebook for a while and he now had my phone number, so we called each other occasionally. Flash forwards a couple of years, aged 17 I lost my poppy (grandpa) he was my favorite person and I really struggled with my mental health and started therapy, I almost didn't graduate high school because of it. six months later I wound up in a psychiatric ward for a week only a month before my 18th birthday, the nurses and doctors in the psych ward didn't believe any of what I was telling them and told me ""Your parents (my mum and stepdad) say there's nothing wrong with you"". the Two years following that have been hell, I've been on so many different medications and overdosed on almost all of them with an intent to kill myself. I've seen many different psychologists, psychiatrists, councilors and doctors to get a diagnosis and get put on the right medication to help me but still nothing. Amongst those there are many other traumatic events that I could list but we'd be here forever. I started dating my partner (20M) almost a year and a half ago and he's been an amazing support person to me, we occasionally have fights over little things but overall he's a great support person to me. I guess what I'm saying is I feel lost, I feel depressed every single day, some days I find it so hard to get out of bed. I would love some advice on what I can do to make my situation a little easier to manage because im honestly sick and tired of trying, I am sick and tired of fighting the illness or illnesses I have. I am sick and tired of not being listened to and sick and tired of my mental health issues being swept under the rug because people find them to complex.

He said what would mum and dad say to you right now and I said that they want me to be happy and he said no, they wouldn’t say that. They aren’t happy with what you’re doing right now. They want you get your life back on track.

Suic-399,"For the first time in my life, I had suicidal thoughts","Hi Everyone,I'm new to the forum and looking to speak with other people going through a similar situation or who may be able to offer advice. I separated from my wife in October 2021, I left a few times and stayed with my dad for a few days but always returned home. The ""spark"" between us was gone and we weren't really talking much. I was happy to leave and move in with my dad until I could find a more permanent solution. We have 2 beautiful daughters together. We had a conversation (not an argument) one night where she asked if I was there for her or just for the kids. I was honest and said that I was there 70% for the kids and 30% for her. She was obviously not happy with this and she left the house. The next morning I was confronted by the police and our home with an IVO against me. She claimed I was financially controlling and a whole heap of other nonsense. The next 12 months would cost me over 100k in legal fees to see my children, along with being slapped with a community corrections order because she messaged me about the kids a few times and I was silly enough to reply. I lost my family business And now everything is finally coming to an end, she won't sign the divorce. I just struggle each day to find the motivation to go on. If I didn't see my girls I know I probably would have ended my life. I've been on anti depressants since I was in my early teens for panic attacks, but I've never felt this depressed before.

Suic-401,Pain in my head,"My past is catching up with me: every morning when I wake the muscles in my head and to my neck are tensely tight and a mild tremor. I spoke to a doctor 5 years ago when it first started but she looked back at me as if she was 'dumb founded' she didn't have any answers nor questioned. I do have a very low threshold to pain. I nearly lost my baby i labour and nearly died myself when the long intense 14 hour labour became intolerable, both of my legs from hip downwards started shaking uncontrollably, my baby developed tachycardia and they rushed me to theatre as baby wasn't coming out. She was a large baby and had swallowed feaces, she was covered in it, brought on by her developing tachycardia. She is 25 years of age now but I wonder if this tremor in my head is a symptom of what is going to happen, a full on body tremor. It only happens when I am waking up from sleep. I do have neuropathy in my legs, numbness, spasms etc I exercise most mornings, 50 minute walk and I always feel great afterwards but I am scared of my body being in physical pain in the future. I am just delaying the inevitable. In 2020 the pain in my thigh was horrendous not even the strongest drugs helped and finally physio after 2 months in bed finally helped lift the pain from thigh, it was so bad I could not walk far. I still have numbness in my left thigh. I am seeing a new doctor this week and hopefully find what's causing the tense knot in my skull and the tremor and frequent spasms in my neck and throat. Weird. I wish most times to never wake up, I wish I had the courage to end this pain but I seem to just go on suffering. I am alone, my daughter lives interstate and is moving overseas in June for 3 years. I have no close family and no friends. My social housing property say to stop gardening as a tenant is trying to stop me. I can't join landcare like they want me to do but other tenants have complimented me it's just this one person causing me grief that I just wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.",HelloGail,Community Member,11-02-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,5,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/pain-in-my-head/td-p/558761

Suic-404,I don't know what to do,"I don't really have anyone close to me, and I came to this site just so I can say something honest somewhere. I moved to Australia at the beggining of high school, and I'll be doing my HSC next year. Since year 7, I never had any friends I felt close to, even growing up in India. Things got so much worse in year 7, I was basically bullied for being headstrong and opinionated. I wasn't perfect, but I never did anything to hurt anyone. I started faking having friends, and lied about having friends outside of school because I didn't want to be as pathetic as I was. The more I pretended not to be alone, the lonelier I got. No matter how well I do in school, even now, it doesn't feel enough. I have good grades? doesn't matter, I'm not at the top of my year in every subject. I have so many dreams, so many goals, but everyday they feel more and more unachievable. I don't know if I even deserve to get a good atar. I started self harming in year 9, my parent's found out then, and they got mad at me and got cold towards me. A year later, I had a breakdown in front of my drama teacher and told her everything. There were phone calls home, and after a lot of fights I got to go see a phsychologist. I thought that would help, but I didn't. I realised that I couldn't be honest, that I didn't feel comfortable with the psychologist largely because she was a middle aged Indian woman who reminded me too much of my mother. I felt pathetic. I acted my way out of that, and now I am lost. I avoid my teacher, I avoid my friends, and I just try to get on with it. I have self harmed since then, not because I want to, but because I feel like I would loose my mind if I don't. I want to make close friends, but I don't know how. I want to be normal, but at the same time I don't. Sometimes I just feel like I'm faking everything for attention.

I don't know what the worst part about it all is either, the guilt I also feel knowing he has a girlfriend of five years also looms on my conscious I have had to deal with and live with this for several months, facing him on a daily basis. Nobody else at work knows anything, I am sure even though he has made threats to ruin my life and tell everyone numerous times, he constantly abuses me, manipulates me and gaslights me about the situation at work and I feel that if anyone found out I would feel so ashamed and embarrassed. I am currently looking for a new job but today has been especially tough for me, we got into a argument over it with him 150% blaming me for everything, trying to guilt trip me, saying he's leaving and he will lose his house and custody of his child ect ect..and it is all my fault. I just don't know what else to do, I have always been depressed on and off in life, many times wanting to KMS, I have been okay for a little while until now. I'm tired of coming home crying because of the abuse which happens more times then I can count on both hands, I don't want to be here, he was the one person I thought I could trust but it turns out for 5 months he was just grooming me practically pretending to be my friend to get closer to me, I live in a state I didn't grow up in now and I basically have no one to talk to. I couldn't even bring myself to tell my mother because I know she would just tell me to pack my things and 'come home' the problem with that is, she too is and always has been abusive toward me growing up. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I am better off just offing myself at this point. I know I need help but I just can't be bothered nor do I want to go through the trauma of rehashing all of the hurt and feelings I have over this predicament with a doctor or medical practitioner that wonr take it seriously.

Suic-425,Can’t remember a time I didn't want to die.,"I have never wanted to be alive. All my life I have planned to die by suicide. I will definitely die from suicide, I am just not sure exactly when. The only reason I havnt done it yet is because I am a single parent and if I die there is no one to look after my children. I plan to die once my youngest is in their early 20’s, I have a plan and take comfort in this. I know it will hurt my children no matter what age they are when I die. But the most I can give them is bringing them up and helping them become independent. Once that is done, I am going. I resent the children for keeping me alive, sometimes I think it could be better for them if I died now, but I know if I do they will likely go into the foster system, so maybe an unhappy, resentful suicidal parent is better then that, I truly dont know.

Suic-426,SH is the only way to feel anything ekse,"Lots of things coming together, or rather apart right now. I'm really trying not to sh but I did again last night. I've tried exercising until it hurts but it isn't the same. It's not the flashing ache of pain like other self harm, it's more like a dull headache. I'm sure many other people struggle on Valentine's Day. I went to my support group the day before and basically learned that everyone there had never had a successful marriage; that being it was full of abuse, trauma, toxicity, etc. That somewhat reminded me that I'm just... Doomed, I guess. I met a young woman I got along quite well with last year. She claimed to be a lesbian initially, but she has gone back to dating men, which made me feel lied to and like she couldn't be honest with either her rejection or me. To top it all, despite me getting out of a bad relationship quite recently, throughout the day she sent me multiple pictures of herself out with her date having fun. We both have ASD but surely this can't be that ignorant. On one hand I want to be happy for my friend, on the other, it feels like she is trying to make me feel this way. I wrote a bunch of music, the only productive thing I've done. It's all terrible. All I can think about is killing myself and that, and how inadequate I am and that if I was deserving of life things wouldn't be like this. Not planning on taking my life. Just thinking about being dead a lot. Suicidal thoughts, not intent. I thought writing this would make me feel better, but it didn't. But now I've done it so I may as well post it.

Suic-428,Recovery from suicide attempt - it can be done,"Hi everyone I wanted to post something positive about how recovery from being suicidal can happen. I am a first timer. I’ve had episodes of depression but don’t usually go deep enough to be suicidal. My heart goes out to all of you and your mental health struggles. Bipolar runs in my family. Mum was a hospital admission last year and sadly, is now a resident in aged care. My 32 yr old son has autism and bipolar 2. My story is one of a battle with depression while supporting Mum (My older brother and I worked together) in hospital and Dad - who has Alzheimers- at home. Both are in their 80s. I was suicidal a year ago and made plans - but had a powerful spiritual experience and didn’t follow through. My naturopath helped me to sort the many Imbalances in my body and I recovered - for a time. Dad followed Mum into care in January and my brother and I sold their house. I then found myself being drawn into being a caregiver for Mum when I was already exhausted and struggling. Suicidal thoughts crept in but I pushed them away. I just tried to keep going - until I couldn’t. One sleepless night, I attempted …..My husband took me to the ED… I was offered mental health support and I accepted. I was in a daze. This was 4 months ago. I was diagnosed with caregiver burnout.I had five sessions with a psychologist, two with a psychiatrist- all from Monash Health and Medicare funded - and found myself doing a lot better. I’m now seeing a private psychologist and have improved even further. My son is almost my fully transitioned into supported accommodation and I am learning to deal with the things that wore me down. Very few people know what I did. I haven’t felt ready to tell them. But my whole outlook has changed. Getting help and being prepared to face my demons is what has changed me. I’m not good at asking for help. I’m better at helping others. I’m actually working on that in therapy. My message to you all is,- don’t be afraid to ask for help. Don’t be afraid to open up and let people in. They can’t help you if they don’t know you are in pain. If you don’t like the health professional you are seeing, ask to see someone else. A good relationship with that person is paramount. Therapy won’t work if you don’t trust them. Most of all, trust that you have it in yourself to overcome this. Your life IS worth living. People DO care. You just have to let them in.",Junior1962,Community Member,27-09-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,74,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/recovery-from-suicide-attempt-it-can-be-done/td-p/548174
Suic-429,Not feeling ok at the moment,"I just need to write down how I’m feeling. I’m exhausted and in pain. I have overwhelming grief recurring that I thought I’d begun to heal from. I’m very dissociated. I know that’s my body trying to protect me from overwhelm. Was seeing someone this week about starting voluntary work (possibly a stepping stone back into workforce). But feel like my body is screaming at me that it’s not ok and can only rest. It’s like I was oversaturated with stress for too many years and I have nothing left. It take’s phenomenal energy to use the small part of me that’s still functioning to interact with others. I manage to convey outwardly that I’m fine and come across as positive and competent even though internally I’m breaking at the moment. I cannot tolerate abusive or exploitative relationships anymore. Putting boundaries up to protect myself, but somehow that triggers more grief linked to past issues even though it’s necessary to establish those boundaries. I had side effects from a med badly flaring one of the autoimmune conditions I have, so came off it. This has triggered other undesirable effects that are potentially serious so have gone back on it. I’ve spent decades now, since childhood, managing chronic pain and health conditions. I’ve always been relentlessly positive, but that is starting to fail. Angry too about denial of abuse in my extended family - the way perpetrators were protected and the reality and impact of abuse denied. This continues. I can’t stand it anymore. Although thoughts of death are there for me almost daily at the moment, I think a will to live in me is stronger. The thoughts are just my mind-body not wanting to struggle anymore.",Eagle Ray,Valued Contributor,20-01-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,38,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/not-feeling-ok-at-the-moment/td-p/557247
Suic-430,Worried about my husband,"My husband has been under a lot of pressure at work over the past year. I've been really worried & have been flagging burnout/depression with his for months. In early December it's like a switch flicked - he stopped engaging, especially with me - still interacting as needed at work. At home, he just shuts down. He's also had a few binge drinking sessions with friends (he's in mid 50's) but aside from that doesn't drink much. I finally convinced him to go see a Dr & is two weeks into antidepressants. I found out a few days ago that a few days prior to the Drs appt he had planned to a suicide attempt but didn't follow through - he volunteered this information to me but now won't talk about it. He said it won't happen again. He says that he told the Dr, but I'm unsure as he insists on going to appts on his own. I'm afraid, and not sure what to do. We had a good relationship before this, ups and downs of course but primarily good. How do I make sure he knows I'm here for him without smothering him and creating additional anxiety? How do I make sure that the Dr knows what has happened? I'm struggling to manage my own feelings with this and neither of us is sleeping well. I guess I'm also trying to understand how to make things worse.",Magnolia11,Community Member,12-02-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/worried-about-my-husband/td-p/558835

Suic-435,Exhausted and scared,"I have bpd, depression, aptsd. This is my first time using a forum, so I apologise firstly if it reads a bit over the place. I think I have had a really bad relapse due to putting myself out in the online dating scene only to be constantly misunderstood, then I get ghosted. I am terribly lonely and have been since the end of my marriage. Which I felt alone for 17 years. I developed acute ptsd from child hood trauma then to watching my son go through leukaemia for 3 1/2 years with no family support. I had to leave my marriage due to cultural abuse and subsequently lost my son who lives with his dad. I totally broke down a year ago and had a plan to end it. At the last minute I went to hospital as a voluntary patient. All was going well until my ex from a brief relationship was brought in by police. He was high on drugs and cornered me straight away. I could not believe that this was happening so I discharged myself and went to my gp. This is when I was diagnosed with bpd which did make alot of sense. But I have relapsed twice in 6 months. Each one is triggered by my ptsd then I do some things that are self destructive but feel good at the time. But then comes the self loathing and such hate for myself. Then the suicidal thoughts kick in cause I can't handle my racing thoughts or the feelings that are so intense that you want to anything to not feel or think. I do this alone as I don't know what's worse, possibly being taken to hospital or being alone cause I don't have anyone to talk to that would understand. Each relapse is harder to handle emotionally physically and mentally. I am so exhausted and afraid that I feel it is only a matter of time before I just give in. P.s a new symptom of bpd has also crept in, I'm paranoid constantly that family and friends are absolutely sick of my constant ups and downs. I mean I am so sick and tired of me I don't blame them.",crystal78,Community Member,04-02-2023,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/exhausted-and-scared/td-p/558255

I have suffered from depression and low self esteem for years. I thought that I would be someone to end up in a hospital, I felt like my world had collapsed and there was nothing else to live for. One morning, after waking up in the hospital again I had to call my boss saying I couldn’t come into work. The surreal world of a mental breakdown had now become a reality. I made a decision that day that I wanted to live, I had to live. The shame is overwhelming at times. I feel as though I have this other side of me, that no one knows about.

It is not working very well. For about 12 months I have been emotionally disconnected except for at times of stress. So at the moment I am not really used to feeling, and when things are coming up my instinct is to push them away however I can. It's not working though. None of my skills/strategies are helping. So my brain is turning to 'what else can work?'I have been repeatedly delaying. Thinking about my dogs, reminding myself of protective factors. I really don't want to let everyone down. Probably the thing that has stopped me. I'm so lost and confused in my own head, and so frustrated with myself.

I've just been extra sensitive to everything, I'd feel upset, annoyed, angry, hurt way to easily. Things that should only make me a little upset, make me feel like my heart has been ripped from my chest. My emotions just go straight to the extremes. last night I was meant to go on a dinner date with my partner, but he cancelled it because he was too tired from work. And that's fair enough, he does work a lot. but this dinner date had literally been the only thing that had helped me get through the week. Not necessarily the date itself, more so just seeing him again, because whenever i see him i know everything's going to be alright, and I'm going to be okay. And i just really needed that. I don't really know exactly what it was but i felt like something in me just broke. and i was just so over thing and everyone and life. I grabbed some alcohol and started drinking. I was also messaging my friend at the time and she decided to come over and drink with me. but by the time she got there i was already intoxicated. I could pretend and say i didn't realise how much i was drinking but in all honesty i knew exactly what i was doing. I only remember snippets, but at some point my friend had left and messaged my partner, who came straight away. He told me this morning what had happened and i pretended like i didn't remember but i remember trying to hurt myself, all while crying my heart and soul out, I don't think I've ever allowed myself to feel the full extent of the hurt vie carried with me throughout the years, but I've never felt this much intense emotionally pain before, it was a whole other level. and he struggled to keep me from hurting my self, you couldn't have said anything that would have stopped me. I don't remember when i stopped but at some point i was just laying there on the shower floor, soaked, surrounded by my vomit, laying so still. and I could hear my partner telling me to get up, trying to get me to stay conscious. he then decided to call the ambulance.

Suic-449,All I can feel is bitterness and hate.,"(My Dad is the only reason I'm still alive. Sometimes I wonder if he has any idea how good a father he's been) My mother abused me. She violently screamed at me everyday, nonstop, from a baby until now (I'm 23). She physically attacked me until I was big enough that she knew she'd lose a fight against me. My siblings abused me. I even have flashbacks of my brother physically assaulting me. He was maybe 8 at the time. I would've been 5? He tried to choke me unconscious, until my Dad found us and pulled him away. My sister exchanged maybe 10 sentences with me over a four or 5 year period of living in the same house. All of those sentences were to insult me. Every friend I have ever had has abandoned me. My best friend attempted to sexually assault someone, and he tried to convince people I sexually assaulted someone (my supposed victim went out of her way to message me saying she never had an issue with me, and that my 'friend' was putting words in her mouth). Despite every one of my friends admitting he was entirely in the wrong, almost all my friends abandoned me so they could keep this psychopath in their lives. Apparently to them, I am worth less than an attemped sexual assaulter (and remember, they believed I was in the right and he was in the wrong. And I still didn't matter).

I loathe myself for creating doubt, pain and stress , for creating chaos and drama. I don't want to be this person, I don't want to poison the world and the lives around me because I'm such a massive mess up. Just want to fall into a dark hole and never get back up.

Suic-454,I need help,"My best friend took his life in 2019 just before covid, its been years and I still want to do something stupid. The only thing stopping me is the feeling I still feel now, I want to die but I don't want anyone to feel like this. I've been to hospital multiple times when I was a kid for these feelings, but now its a lot worse because someone who I done everything with is gone. We grew up in state care and got addicted to drugs as kids. I have more questions, he was the last person I'd expect to harm himself. I just want closure and I don't think ill ever get that, I don't think I can live without answers. I got rid of everything sharp in my house, I'm fkn 27 years old living alone with no knifes in the house. Got rid of my nailgun because I had racing thoughts, I don't know if I've done enough to stop anything. Nothing gives my joy in life like I use to like playing drums, I don't know if its the drugs that ruined my enjoyment in general life activities or if its life in general. I want to die, but I can't do it to my family now I know what it feels like. I don't take drugs anymore but drinking is becoming a problem, that's when I want to do stupid things. I'm fkn lost and I can't talk to anyone because they'll freak out, I don't want anyone to worry because it feels bad to worry. I know at some point, I wont be able to control myself and do something to myself I can't take back. I have nothing to offer in life, I'm not an idiot and I know others see that in me. The thing is I don't care, I just don't want anyone else to hurt. I've seen too much shit in state care growning up. I'm overwhelmed by life, I don't know what to do. I'm on an anti-depressant but its fkn useless, it doesn't help anymore. I think my depression is beyond medication, I need sedation so I can't think. On top of that I was diagnosed with COPD at 24 from smoking. Everything is adding up to an inevitable ending that I can't handle, its almost 12am and here I am spilling my problems because I don't know what to do anymore. I just want peace but I find the opposite, I can't be sober and that's a problem. My best friend may still be alive if he never ended up in care or on drugs, I feel like I'm heading down the same road. I hate life, but at the same time I love my family and want to live for them.

I have a plan and can get rid of it but has become a security blanket for me. I know I can be better. I have been better. my strategies aren't working as well as I hoped they would. My meds aren't working as well as they should be but keeping up with them. Usually I stop taking them but a part of me is fighting these thoughts. Idk what to do.

Suic-456,Depression kicking my butt... can't get joy from anything,"I'm over 30 and just don't have any motivation anymore for anything. Nothing excited me about the future.I have a partner who I love very much but is also just stressing about work all the time and going through his own problems.He's strong though and not a very easily emotional person, so I think maybe he's better off finding someone else.I just can't see myself wanting to be around anybody anymore, only my cats. Animals have always been there for me: my parents tried but I was too ""different"" they couldn't connect with me. Also at school I was bullied and never had any friends. I mean people always still invite me to parties but never anything personal really. I tried making a friend who I though we got along perfectly but then she said she was getting busy with work and I never heard from her again. I guess people just get bored of me and I don't hate them for it , I have just accepted they will be happier with people in similar personalities etc... I wanted to do a course in vet nursing, but even in the past it was a struggle as I was studying ""at my own pace"" but still had to hand in assignments on a due date. Supervising nurses could never keep to it as I was only a volunteer, why put in effort to train me ? Corona hit and I had to take a break anyways... Nothing I want out of life, even with hard work is achievable. People are all busy with their own problems and have no idea how to help me. I made an appointment with my psychologist for next week , I had the luxury of taking some days off, which is unfair compared to even my partner who has to work to the bone for his job and things . I guess I'm hoping to find something to want me to carry on, but nothing in this world makes it worth the hard work and stress anymore, I just want to sleep, at least my dreams are nicer most of the time.",Jessksch,Community Member,05-12-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,12,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/depression-kicking-my-butt-can-t-get-joy-from-anything/td-p/553976
Suic-457,Feel that things are getting worse,"Hello everyone. It has been a while since I used these forums, I guess I stopped knowing what to say but have found myself back in a mindset where I think making a thread and visiting others is what might help me right now.I feel safe right now, though maybe I was not over Christmas. I live with my family who contribute greatly to depression and other kinds of thoughts. I have been really struggling to eat as well, I guess with how explicit an issue that is right now I am realising that due to health issues since I was born I have maybe never had a healthy relationship with food? I am managing to eat at least once a day, but I worry about it and did go to a care centre at one point because I knew I would not eat at all otherwise.I think I realised where my thinking about self-harm comes from, not sure if that is anything of value but maybe that knowledge will help me find something else to do instead as it seems to be a way of coping with my other pain, though not a healthy one. It does seem to be a different place than suicidal thinking too, which is more a place of hopelessness. Not sure if it is appropriate to go into details of whys so I guess I will leave that there.Things feel hopeless. Someone mentioned that they just kept living in tomorrow and even if things got worse they could derive a morbid humour from that, but... things keep getting worse, I tried to live for tomorrow and now tomorrow makes me nauseous, tomorrow is something I feel I need to avoid. Tomorrow is more abuse, another coping mechanism that stops working, and potentially it is another unsafe day. All I have to look forward to is eventually hearing from my friend again, it has been longer than I would like with no understanding of why they disappeared, but I have to believe that I have that at least because if I start being insecure about them again I have nothing. No reason to keep going.

I find lately that even when I’m have a hyper manic episode that I am having suicidal ideations.

Suic-461,It’s like I don’t deserve anything,"I’m safeI find myself second guessing everything I say or do in my life which leads me into a downward spiral most days. I think of other people first before myself and then feel as though I have let myself down, that’s when the negative thoughts take over and my self esteem drops. It feels like I live in a fantasy world of my own and everyone else is bypassing me, they don’t see or acknowledge me. They know where they are going in life but I don’t. I feel stuck in time. I seek approval from people for everything because I don’t believe in myself and it’s exhausting. I’m a people pleaser. I am constantly trying not to upset people with my words or actions. I have OCD (even writing on this forum has taken me an hour going back over it again and again) I’m worried about what people will think. I’m cautious all the time so as to not say or write the wrong thing to upset anyone or worse to trigger them or make them feel bad. I don’t know why my brain is wired to do this and to give of myself so much and then feel so worthless. Second guessing why I do what I do and say constantly it is debilitating. On the flip side, I have been sober for 19 months. I found drinking was a double edged sword. I loved it, it helped numb the thoughts and feelings but it let my words and actions hurt the people I love. I eventually left my family, felt I wasn’t good enough for them, they deserved better. I felt so unloved and lonely when I was with them but feel lonely without them too. It’s Christmas morning and I just don’t feel very Christmassy. I have more down days than up but I keep going. I like to see people happy and never want anyone to feel the way I do. I meditate only at night time just before bed because it makes me sleepy. I try and surround myself with people who make an effort and reach out to me first, that gives me a sense of belonging. I find it hard to be around loud opinionated people. I take a lot of bad energy from these people and unfortunately internalise it. I have only just started to see a therapist, been once but looking forward to the next visit..

Suic-463,I have a problem with CBT,"I have a problem with CBT.CBT is always telling me to reframe my thoughts. Its kind of invalidating and telling me that despite a large amount of evidence to contrary, that I am thinking about situations 'incorrectly.' The truth is; I am more accurate in my thinking than most. The world really has become shit. Capitalism, greed, misogyny and racism have fucked up my life and it's statistically, factually, unlikely to be changing any time soon no matter what mental gymnastics I put myself through. I really am post-menopausal. I really won't have children. My parents and partner will never really understand me. They won't. I know them too well. It is too late to have friends. Yes, it is. They all have children and none of them have time for me. They are actually awkward around me. They live on planet family - which I'm sure has it's complications, I live on planet loneliness and isolation. They are incompatible mindsets. The world really is hurtling towards a climate disaster, an overconsumption disaster and a billionaire-led fascist insanity disaster. I am just living until I die. It will largely be the same. There is literally no point. I am not a theoretical physicist and at this point I think that high level abstract science is the only thing left that will leave me with a sense of awe and mystery and it's probably too late to do anything meaningful in this field. Being intelligent is the only thing I can base my self-esteem on. So therefore, I cannot stand CBT constantly gaslighting me, telling me I'm not able to 'manage my thoughts and emotions' which is a super nice way of saying I am stupid and defective. It then advises me that thinking I am stupid and defective is just further evidence of my stupidity and defectiveness that I need to 'work on'. Super helpful. Not. I did a medical degree. I have evidence of my intellectual intelligence. I have worked in psychiatry with my patients consistently liking me and finding my interactions helpful for them. I therefore have evidence of my emotional intelligence.",Outside observing,Community Member,02-12-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,16,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-have-a-problem-with-cbt/td-p/553783

Suic-466,Have tried to help family and done wrong by them and alone now,"G'Day guys, Don't know how to start this and my first step in an maybe last attempt to reach out. 5 years ago I lost my wife at a young age, passed away and had a very close relationship with one of my cousin's in another state. My cousin assisted me to move away and move in with her and her husband, in return I assisted in financial wealth gain which is something I'm good at and I tried to get help with counselling, currently in antidepressants and was at one point addicted to pain killers which I finally got off but still on the antidepressants. Long story short, I had ended up losing my cousin's savings and a huge amount of my own backing that got me this far (most of it was my wife's insurance payout) and now in a terrible place. I for so long lied to my cousin / family about the lost, attempting to rebuild back but failed completely multiple times and lost all my own assets and cash now. Her husband found out and they tried to talk to me, me being a person who runs away and can't confront things very well, I ended up staying with a the only close friend I have at the moment in a garage, a mattress on the ground thinking I can't move forward from this. Left it for too long, my cousin and husband are now pretty sour (understandable) and want my stuff moved out from their place and I'm now on the verge of taking my own life. Lost all I had worked for and owned. If it wasnt for my friend here I would be on the street but I can't keep this up, as he would need his own space too. So I'm thinking of just calling it quits when I tried so much to help family out but ended up so badly. I've got nothing else to live for anyways.

Suic-475,365 days.,"There are just 24 days left of 2022. Each day that passes is one less that I need to survive. 341 days of survival. I can't call it living, I may be alive, but at this point I am purely surviving and even then only just. In my 34 years I have suffered from mental heath issues for about 19 of those. Over time, I have learnt coping strategies, ways of recognising warning signs and when to ask for help. In my late teens and early 20s, I went through a stage of self harm and risky behaviour. There were no suicide attempts, nor thoughts. Just a general feeling of being misunderstood and wanting to escape the world. My mid to late 20s, my anxiety became more prominent, I withdrew and self isolated. The suicide ideations began during this period, but I could never commit suicide, it wouldn't be fair on those around me. My early 30s were a period of great upheaval. They haven't been good years. There has been a lot of loss, people, places, jobs, things, the will to continue. I lost 2 different family friends to suicide in this period, and my own father was at times suicidal. My thoughts moved towards dying through accidental means or through terminal illness, something that wasn't my fault. At 34, the year 2022, for the first time I find myself spending the majority of the 365 days of the year, just surviving. I have considered suicide more days this year, than not. Whilst the thoughts are just thoughts. With no specific plan, I am fearful that with time that may change. I am fearful, that the thoughts will get too overwhelming and I'll make a snap decision.

The country I am travelling to is the only thing to complete on my very short bucket list. I was hoping for April last year of when to pass, but this did not occur. Reaching 18 was never something I had planned for, and now going to the one place I have always wanted to go seems like the opportunity for it. I can’t stand the thought of the phone call they will get. I still remember their faces when we lost my brother. I can’t help to both want this but fear it so much. I don’t want to but I want to so much. I can’t do this to my family again but when the time comes, and I am standing in the forest I have always wanted to, what will my mind decide? I am terrified and I feel so, so guilty. I love my family so much that it stops me, but I fear being alone with this opportunity. I don’t want to do this I promise, I need some help. I don’t want to tell anyone because this will set my family back far too much if they know.

Suic-479,Christmas Drinking and Work,I had my work Christmas party on Friday night. I was quite anxious going and I ended up getting really drunk and ended up puking and having to be brought home by someone else in the office. I don't remember a lot of it. I woke up completely paniced on Saturday morning and ended up with my friend ringing the CAT team for me. All I wanted to do was end it all. I have managed to get myself back into the window of tolerance and the feelings aren't as big I do feel safe. But I do feel overwhelmed and the thought of logging onto work tomorrow is completely overwhelming and freaking me out that I will be fired. I keep catastrophising and I know that rationally I'm not being right but the thoughts just keep on coming. I know it is my own fault but I haven't been in this job long and it is senior so I just feel like I've done damage and if something is said I don't know how I will handle it. How do I work through this? I also think it is the time of year I find really hard but why did it have to all come crashing down at a Christmas function,Tryingtomoveon,Community Member,04-12-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/christmas-drinking-and-work/td-p/553911
Suic-480,Living in car,"Howdy everyone. My partner and I of 7 years broke up at the start of the year and I've got no place to go. My 3 kids don't know that I'm officially classed as homeless and living out of my car for the last 9 months. Both my parents and sister have passed away a while ago now and I don't have any family to turn to for help. 2 mates know all the details and how I'm living and trying to help. I'm still working 2 jobs and can't get a rental to call home either. I had 2 Social workers give up on me trying to find a home, my ex was trying for 3 weeks but gave up and now a mate has offered to help with a bond if I find a place. Finding a place seems like a waste of time because I don't have anything to put in a home. My dog is living with the ex and she won't let me see my 15yo dog either now or even send me a picture of how she is going as well.. this Xmas coming will be the 8th shittiest in a row now and I just can't do it again. I just can't seem to get a break in life or get the hell I need to have a happy life again or share it with someone that loves me. Everything seems pointless or useless to me and all I can think of is just going, disappear or leave without a trace to never come back. I know it will break my 2 sons 18,17 and my 20yo daughter would not care. She refuses to see me, talk to me or even reply in texts and now she won't let me see my 9 month old grandchild that I've seen 1 time for 10 min. I have no where to go, no one to turn to and everyone gives up on me now and I can not see the light at the end of the tunnel and only seems like my hole is getting deeper by the day now. I cry myself to sleep most nights while sleeping in a sleeping bag in my car and pray to the lord to take me in my sleep but it never happens. I'm sick of this missarible life and so exhausted to the point where I can't think of see properly now.

Suic-481,Trigger Warning: I would like to end my own life now.,"I first thought about taking my own life back in 2014. That happened to be the first year that I self harmed. I was in Year 11 at the time and I was being bullied relentlessly for having curly hair - ever since Year 8. But ever since Year 8 I was being bullied for various different reasons. I can't recall what those reasons were, as it was so long ago, but what I can recall is that the teachers did nothing about it, despite the involvement of my mother and grandmother (this was back when my mother was a decent individual and when my grandmother worked for the Department for Education.) I was previously an A and B grade student but then plummeted to a D and E and NA student from the bullying. I ended up quitting school. In 2012, I joined a netball team, after playing for another club many years prior, where I was punished for being a phenomenal shooter (I was put in WD every game - I certainly wasn't having any fun - like the coach wanted us to.) My breathing disorder (not asthma) was not taken seriously by the team or the coach (who - the coach - I believe has undiagnosed Narcissistic Personality Disorder) and I was eventually kicked off of the team and booted out of the club for reasons unknown. The coach demanded that her team won every single game of the season. In 2013, I played against my old team on one occasion and I was put in GS. I was being bullied on court by the GK (who usually played in C) as she kept slapping the ball out of my hand deliberately (her mother/coach told her to do this) and when I missed ONE goal her mother told her that I should 'give up shooting goals,' which was loud enough for me to hear. Well guess what? She gave up coaching because her team weren't good enough for her (not even her own daughter was good enough for her). So, who is the real winner here? If you made it this far - THANK YOU! I actually feel a bit better now that I have shared this with you.

Suic-484,Tips to survive when feeling suicidal - please share,"Hi all. I've been suicidal for quite a while and I know it's excruciatingly difficult. My 15 hospital visits in a two year period with 4 intake to the acute (voluntary) mental health ward suggests I might know a bit about it. I'd like to think so anyway. What I'd like to do (if moderators allow) is for each and every one of you on here who is suicidal, has been suicidal, might become suicidal - to please name and list your coping mechanisms. The reason I am starting this thread is because the standard ""mental health plan"" via Drs didn't work for me (I still encourage others to do it definitely) and had to make my own plans that suited me. I'll start and I hope others contribute as this isn't about me, it's about what we can share to help others in that moment (yes, anyone suicidal knows that moment) I personally now: 1. put a light on if it's dark. Darkness scares me. If I feel panic the light is on immediately. 2. put a movie on. Even if it's 5am like now it goes on to distract me and even searching for a movie helps 3. plan a new hobby. Even if it doesn't eventuate, just getting excited on something other than self misery helps me. I've planned many overseas trips that haven't eventuated but it helped me. 4. never respond or engage with toxic people. Whether it be social media, family (in my case) or friends. If not positive or understand to a basic level leave it immediately - this takes courage and harsh, but if they are toxic they are no good for you. 5. financially ease your burden as much as possible. Unless a millionaire we all struggle, but paying for things you don't need causes further stress. Cut them and put money elsewhere or save. That's just my 5 for now but I'd love to hear more on how you have coped. I'm still a massive work in progress and we are all learning together.

Suic-486,Idle ponderings - no suicide attempts,"I spent most of my life, up to the age of 52, wanting my existence to end. I still believe that I never went though with a suicide attempt because of my fear of failure. I've done a mental health first aid course and know that I'm supposed to avoid using words like ""failure"" and ""success"", but that's how I think of it (sorry). Now to my pondering or thinking out loud. I wonder whether the severity of my depression actually saved me? That is, I was so depressed that success seemed like an impossible outcome - I'd find a way to screw up my plan(s) somehow. Did my not taking action increase my depression and make suicide seem even more impossible to me? Was this one of my mind's ways of protecting me?

Suic-487,will it ever get better,"I'm sick of feeling depressed, people not understanding esp at work. I'm sick of this shitty life and feeling like I haven't achieved enough or I'm not good enough. I don't know what direction to head into. I've been gradually getting worse for the past year. Four years ago I was removed from one work area to another. I got talked into it and have regretted ever since. Now I'm stuck in customer service - an area I hate and which brings back bad memories from 20 years ago. In late 2021 I was given another task which means dealing with even more difficult customers. I then had a car accident last year in which someone passed away (not my fault). Ever since then I find I can't cope as well. I have sent about 2-3 emails to my manager saying how i don't fit in, there is no support, I hate my job and I regretted moving - usually when I'm at my lowest and feeling suicidal. Nothing gets done. The last time HR was called in - nothing done again. They don't want to accept any responsibility for putting me in this situation. I was told not to send any more emails or speak about how I feel to my supervisor, that I'm stressing everyone out and I'm too hard on everyone (this was the first time I heard of this). They just want to blame me. I'm stuck as I don't have the mental strength right now to find a job elsewhere. I also don't know what to do with my life. Last week they advertised another position at a higher level in my area. I decided after trying to motivate myself, I will apply for the job as I think I could exceed in the role. However, when I asked my supervisor if she could be my referee, instead of being supportive she questioned why I would want to apply. It felt so obvious that she would want anyone else in the job except me. She ended the conversation by saying that everyone is welcomed to apply. All day I was building myself up to write the selection criteria. I actually thought my supervisor would have expected me to apply. It was a shock that she felt differently. Work insisted I see a psychologist which has made me financially worse off. I have been spending/shopping far too much in the last year just to make me feel better but now I feel even more depressed. I really am struggling how to get out of this as I'm feeling even more depressed and suicidal. I was first diagnosed when I was 20 and I've had this for 30 years. I'm over it and I think everyone else around me has had enough too.",Tia12,Community Member,30-11-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/will-it-ever-get-better/td-p/553603
Suic-488,NOT important just looking for advice,"Hi all! So recently (like a week ago on Monday) I found out that someone I have been becoming friends with has been self harming. Turns out he has a kind of abusive father who gave him a lot of crap. This really made me sad as he is a really good person, but on Tuesday I accidentally found out that his recent ex-girlfriend that he is still close friends with also has some cuts. He broke up with her because he liked her best friend (they are dating now, ex-Gf still likes the other boy). She hadn’t told her best friend about her self harming yet and I didn’t want to confront her about it so I left it. Later that day she told one of her most trusted friends. I was glad that she told someone, but I also felt bad that I had left her alone. I have been struggling with depressed thoughts since the start of this year but I don’t want to ask if I can take a test. This situation just tipped me over a barrier and I started self-harming myself as well. I blame myself for my friends situation and I feel guilty about not asking her about it when I found out. I told my youth group leader on Friday and they told me to tell my parents, but I don’t think it is that bad and I was getting better, but on Friday night I just had a huge mental breakdown and I was so panicked that he was going to tell my mum that I didn’t know what to do.

Suic-491,I hate this life,"Been here a few times, only back because I'm distressed again. I'm a massive theme park enthusiast and have been a member of a theme park site called Parkz, over the past few months it feels like I've simply hounded, you state your opinion on something and it turns into a giant argument, I had to constantly defend myself. 2 days ago, I cracked a joke, and accidentally made a typo, I was hounded for that, had someone say my half of my content is a waste and that it's annoying to read, in other words was called annoying. I reached the end and threatened suicide, a few hours later police knock on my door to check on me. I vented yesterday to parkz, about this saying the bullying on here is horrible and that parkz almost killed me, if it wasn't for police I don't know if I would be here. Obviously the mods of parkz pulled it down pretty quick, banned me indefinitely from parkz, which is fine because I wasn't coming back and instead of thinking parkz might be the problem the asshole moderator, simple stated to ""please get help, parkz can't help you, we can't have you continuing here."" And gave me lifelines stupid number, which is useless. Immediately saying I'm the problem, yeah I have depression, but for months I've been happy I've been good, for the first time in years. I come back to Parkz, and my mental plummets, coincidence I think not. It's a common saying on that site to have thick skin, and not be sensitive, why would that be? you get my point. They did this to me, they made me want to commit suicide again, and still I want to die. I've been through enough in this world, been bullied like crazy throughout my school years, even by some teachers, why because I was autistic, or as they said spastic. Lost a really good mate of mine to an accident, last thing I ever said to him was drop dead, because we got in an argument. I had a cousin who I considered my brother, turns out he stabbed me in the back, lied used me, got about $5000 out of me, but worst of all he raped a mutual family friends daughter, twice, and almost did it a third time. I was left broken after it. I could go on, but there's no point. Finally I break free and start to feel happy again, and get back involved in something I like, now I'm back here, and I have a difficult moderator basically saying it's your fault, nothing to do with parkz.

I am a 51 year old mother of 3.I joined a while ago, but never really posted or read anything until now, tbh trying to work out how to use the forums is a bit confusing. So here I am introducing myself. Late teens was when I first started suffering from Clinical Depression, but I had no idea what was going on. When I finished Hight School and started working Anxiety and Panic Attacks reared their ugly heads. Then at 25 I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, I started working as a clerk in a Hospital Emergency, and whilst there my antidepressants were changed and when i wheined off the first one brand I suffered my first nervous breakdown at 29. Then had 2 more in the next few years. In 2006, my husband and I lost our 2nd child, a son. I hit rock bottom and can't remember the next 3 months. I spent the next 11 years being alive but not really living, then in 2017, when things were going well I enrolled to become a nail technician. I was so excited I felt like I could really make a change. then 5 weeks into the course within 3 days, we had handed over a child we were kinship caring for and had for 4 years (there was major issues with the people handling our fostering setup) and my mother had passed away. It's 5 years later and I am broken, I can't work because I have no self esteem, confidence. I am so lonely because I live in a town without family, which I have cut myself off from. I have no friends because I know no one to go anywhere with to meet to new people. NOT that I really even believe that I am worth while anyone getting to know me.

Suic-494,Suicide rates bipolar,"FACTS- 75% of suicides are male, suicide is the leading cause of death between ages 15-44yo, suicides yearly is more than double the road toll and on average 135 people are effected by one suicide. You are 17 times more likely to suicide if bipolar. Research suggests up to 20%Trusted Source of people with bipolar disorder, especially when untreated, die by suicide. A larger percentage, around 20% to 60%, attempt suicide at least once during their life and (from ""Healthline""). Talking for myself- I've had one attempt but I want to talk about the few minutes prior to that objective. That feeling comes regularly, say twice a year. It is preceded by a trauma of some description, an argument, a socially embarrassing situation or less often, a tragedy like whale beaching or human suffering. Those are my triggers. When younger it could have included- financial hopelessness or excess criticism of my mother (estranged now since 2010) or bullying. Every person with bipolar suffers differently and I also have dysthymia and that is relevant as my childhood trauma has resulted in extreme sensitivity not dissimilar to HSP (highly sensitive person of which up to 20% of people are).

Suic-495,Perimenopausal depression and suicidality,"I just wanted to share a realisation I’ve had since last night. After several weeks of suicidal feelings and a strange anxious depression, I’ve realised that biological changes I’m going through that I’m now becoming conscious of may be a factor. I’m 47 and perimenopausal symptoms are becoming quite apparent. While there is no doubt underlying trauma issues I’ve been looking into are part of it, I’ve realised the emotions around these issues have been greatly intensified by hormonal imbalances that have become more radical. I’ve just read an article that describes depression as being 16 times higher in perimenopausal women than in other groups of Australians, according to the Medical Republic, a publication by doctors and journalists. A recent study found 1 in 10 perimenopausal women have suicidality. Research has also shown women developing clinical depression during perimenopause when they didn’t previously have it, and others whose depression was under control finding it’s no longer controlled. Conventional treatment approaches to depression may not work as well in perimenopausal depression, from what I’ve read, so I’m looking to see what is known about alternatives. So with this insight I’m going to seek some professional health care advice. Just knowing that hormonal factors are likely involved takes the edge off feeling horrendous. I still don’t feel quite right but I can see the fuller picture now of why things have recently gone downhill. So if you are in a similar age bracket and you have feelings towards suicidality and/or self-harm, this may be another avenue to look at and it can be worth doing some research and talking to health care professionals (even though I know this can seem really hard when you’re in the middle of these feelings). I thought I was going crazy but the unbalanced feelings are making sense. I’ve become aware of parts of myself that split off in the past due to trauma and these parts of myself have been especially distressed in recent weeks as hormones have destabilised. Now more in my attention I can work towards healing and re-integrating those parts of myself. Previous suicidal thoughts have linked to specific traumatic stressful events in my life that overwhelmed me. This time it made less sense but it’s becoming clearer now. It’s kind of a relief and I hope to feel better soon.",Eagle Ray,Valued Contributor,20-11-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/perimenopausal-depression-and-suicidality/td-p/552824

I still find it incredibly hard to navigate my thoughts and feelings within this world without getting locked up. I still have feelings and I don’t want to be palmed off. It’s all just pretty talk about RUOK and mental health; but nothing changes. I remember when I was close and I felt as abandoned as I did as a child. It makes me incredibly sad and angry because two of my friends lost their lives the year I let attempted.",Guest_2350,Community Member,06-11-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,11,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/would-anyone-care/td-p/551625
Suic-500,Suspected sleep apnea is making me consider suicide,"It's 3am and I woke up in the middle of the night for the second time in a row these past two days. I'm dead tired, constantly paranoid and nearly just wanna phone it in for this lifetime. And you know what? I feel ashamed for even feeling this way. Everyone else in my family supposedly has it, but I'm the only one struggling with it? How dare I! How dare I leave work early because I could barely stand! How dare I focus on my diet and lifestyle just to function like everyone else! How dare I, how dare I... The sleep clinic is taking forever to get back to me and I'm starting to think I'll never get that sleep study at all. I don't even know if I can afford it if it ever comes in. I've been desperately trying to find solutions to this but I'm just as clueless as I was a year ago, when I nearly completely botched my studies. I desperately want to believe there's hope but I'm finding it harder and harder to believe each night I wake up with a splitting headache or a dry mouth. I have such a clear and beautiful vision for what I want for the future but it just seems more and more like some whimsical fantasy cast up to cope with the life I have now. I don't know what I want to achieve from this post other than catharsis for having written this. I just know if I attempt to post this, I will regret it, if I don't, I'll regret that too! Kill myself and keep going, I will regret both of them. Get the sleep study or not, I will regret either way.

Suic-501,Approach I’ve found helpful for thoughts of suicide and self-harm,"I just wanted to share an approach that’s helped me in recent days in relation to a depression that came over me in recent weeks and involved some thoughts of suicide and self-harm. The depression was linked to a traumatic memory I’ve now been able to identify. Unable to sleep one night I researched online and found the work of Janina Fisher, a psychotherapist who works with clients with complex trauma. Often the part of us that is experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide is exactly that, just a part, not the whole of us. But the challenging thing is it can feel like the whole of us. In Janina Fisher’s approach it’s possible to identify individual parts that have split off as a survival response. These parts can be unconscious because of the way traumatic memories are stored. But it’s possible to bring gentle awareness to the part that might be feeling shame, fear etc and realise it’s not the whole self. We can then parent and take care of this part with self-compassion. It can help to do this with a caring therapist who is familiar with the approach. I asked my psychologist if she could do this work with me and we did yesterday, and it enabled me to sense and feel what my child self was feeling and be present with that child self to help them feel safe. It’s transforming the self-attack drive behind impulses towards self-harm and suicidal ideation into caring for that part that split off in the past due to trauma. This allows the part to re-integrate into the whole person in a healthy way. I just wanted to share this in case it helps even one other person. It’s still something I’m working on, but it’s given me an understanding of what’s actually been happening to me and that there’s something I can do about it.",Eagle Ray,Valued Contributor,11-11-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/approach-i-ve-found-helpful-for-thoughts-of-suicide-and-self/td-p/552087

Suic-505,Constantly in this negative train,"TW Suicidal ideations, urges I honestly don't know where else to get help from... My local hospital seemed to not take the necessary step to help me out with my problem... Whenever I present to their ED they just do all the ED stuff and then just discharges me even when I still pose a risk to myself... I even verbalise to them directly that I am not safe to go home... I feel so rejected and defeated right now... I'm actually afraid to go home nowadays coz of how strong my ideations and urges are lately... Plus how vivid these ideations are... I have community mental health support but I just feel that I'm not supported enough or for them my problem is not as bad as I feel or imagine it to be... I feel like I'm going more mental and that I'm making all these things up... The only way I sort off have to keep myself safe is by either forcing myself to sleep as soon as I get home or if I'm just at home OR I have to keep busy with work (which depends on how much shift they'd give me)... I am trying to take on a new hobby which is bejewelling a portrait of a rose that I bought in Big W the other day... I can only do so much, so what do I do when I ran out of options to distract myself? Or what do I do when I'm so stuck in my head that I can't stop myself from going thru the plan which btw is always in play it's just a matter of trying to put it off every waking day... ive been diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, depression and anxiety. I was on meds but due to conflicting information between different doctors I decided to stop taking them for months now... Due to a very limited number of psychology sessions under Medicare, I had to spread my appointment very thin specially now that I'm only left with 4-5 sessions for the year... Just got approved for NDIS funding just waiting for the allocation of budget. I have a community mental health support worker that's under my local hospital... Even with all these I still feel unheard, ignored and/or not taken seriously specially when my suicide plan is pretty serious... Also I live alone so if I do anything without telling someone no one would ever know... It scares me a little bit but each time I get rejected and ignored my fear seemed to slowly disappears and I know that one day I won't be scared I.

Suic-506,Tonight I realised how self-harm had snuck into my thoughts,"Hi I am safe, and I have a safety plan. I wasn't sure where this belongs, and it took me a lot to post in this forum rather than the more general ones. I'm going through a rough patch again, one of several this year, this one due to relationship issues that have broken a fairly good 2 month mental wellness run for me. Many thoughts about that but tonight I was writing some stuff about how to manage my tendency to lash out when triggered. I thought about inflicting pain on myself as a circuit-breaker. I thought about different options, self harming stuff that I could do immediately, and could hide any marks. Earlier today, I was hungry (I hadn't eaten properly because of work and anxiety) and I took some sort of ""comfort"" in that feeling. Not long after, I thought ""wtf has happened to me"". I never would have considered this (I barely understood it in others) and I feel quite ashamed and guilty. I have been through some pretty big difficulties in life, and never felt this way (at least as far as I could recognise). I've prided myself in being able to get through tough times, but my self esteem has taken a real hit lately. I feel like I'm in for a bumpy ride for the relationship and I feel I might stay in a bad situation because of my fear of not coping with a break-up. I deleted the thoughts from my writing but felt that I had to put it out somewhere as a reminder that I felt them, and how I dealt with them.",Leica27,Community Member,01-11-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/tonight-i-realised-how-self-harm-had-snuck-into-my-thoughts/td-p/551226

It’s constant day in day out continuously having to live life and do the things that you have to do but in the back of your mind knowing what you really want to happen. It’s so hard living missrable knowing you have tried everything to change that mind set and it still not working. It’s getting worse as each day goes by. I am constantly telling myself to snap out of it, constantly trying my best to do what I have to do but knowing exactly what I want. I hear people writing you really don’t want to die. Oh but I do and I’m comfortable with it and I don’t think it’s fair that I am forced to have to live with this crap on my mind. There’s a lot more backstory but basically I’m tired of it all and thought I’d express myself on here.

Suic-510,My inner demons are winning,"TW Suicidal ideations and urges here we are once again, waking up feeling like crap then to have my inner demons shouting like hell inside my head… no one truly understand the feeling that one goes thru in moments like this… so let me tell describe what or how I’m feeling when I’m struggling… More than often it’s starts with feeling anxious upon waking up. When I say anxious, it means im abit on the edge that it’s like there’s an immediate threat towards myself. Some of the time it settles down when I fully wake up which can last upto 2hrs upon waking up. If it doesn’t, then my demons starts waking up. When I say demons, it’s the suicidal ideations in my head. Not long after they wake up comes the urge to act on it… the urge is like an itch or pressure inside me, if you scratch it(act on the thought) I feel some relief but the downside is that if wanna keep doing it just to relieve that pressure. If I don’t act on the thought, they will go for a little bit but comes back 10x worse than the last which means it just keeps building up until I can’t handle it anymore.., and more than often I I’d give in to just feel some relief. Then it start all over again during the day… I can go many cycles (short intervals) in a day but sometimes I only get a few long cycles which is worse than having little ones… I do feel ashamed of what I’m doing to myself specially when people knows about it. Hence I try to keep to myself which then brings the isolation… which leads to loneliness then lead to an attempt… I currently feel that I’m in the brink of really giving in to these demons in my head… work can just keep me safe for 8hrs but after that? It’ll be hard to not act on the urge… I live alone and coz I’ve distanced myself from people including my family , that no one will think or wonder if I’m okay or not.

Suic-512,I’m Tired,"Some days I feel so suicidal I don’t even feel like leaving a note. I just feel like walking out the door and never coming back. I get annoyed that I’m loved by people cause it forces me to stay.My favourite “oh you should stay”, is thinking about the reallysmall impact people that you’ve met like if your primary school crush found out, or that teacher who used to think you’d go really far, “she’s really smart she just doesn’t focus” those people who would spend a minute mourning you, the old best friend. One of the 4 boyfriends you’d had growing up. The guy I spoke to yesterday questioning his self worth cause he couldn’t “save me” I also get annoyed thinking I want to go cause I’ve lost people I love in my life and I know they’d take my spot to be here in a heart beat.. how could I possibly be so ungrateful. I also get annoyed that I’ve told so many people I’m sad and they just kinda agree and laugh. has depression become something we talk about at dinner? Maybe that’s not a good thing.. at least not for me. my favourite line from anyone who listens is “wow your so self aware, that’s the first step” Well funny thing is Karen I’ve been self aware my whole depression experiencei know all the problems but somehow 2+2 is still equaling 5. I like to go inside my head and list off all the reasons why I might be like this. - am I too lazy to change - do I find no purpose in life- does nothing excite me I feel like sadness off of inside out but it’s like an embedded sadness like one thats more a personality trait. Like when I get home I get to take off my funny, cool girl suit and turn into jelly. Even when I am ‘myself’ I’m never really ‘myself’ till I’mby myself.

I've been feeling extremely anxious and depressed lately and I couldn't stop myself from overthinking. I've been working in a small agency for a month and I'm feeling happy and shitty at the same time. I know I should be grateful for my job as my team are really nice and friendly but I also feel like an imposter because I don't understand why they're hiring me. I don't see myself as a great asset here, even though I even passed my writing test during my second interview. I also think that because it's my first full-time job and I'm an international student - I'll need to work hard to stay in Australia to fully secure my job. I am so mad at myself. Having intrusive thoughts/overthinking has become a habit and it's ADDICTING. Whenever I feel like dying, I tried to re-read the strategies and my own logical statements that I've written the other day. I was literally forcing myself to think rationally and writing down emotional vs logical thoughts while my mind was banging and screaming and telling me to just die because I am worthless and I am not perfect enough to be loved. My thoughts are so conflicting - I want to die just to end my suffering but I also don't want to die because I don't want to run away. I hate myself for being so weak. Thinking about past experiences made me feel nauseous and I hated myself for being so vulnerable. When I tried to open up to one of my friends (I tried to trust them), it seemed like they didn't try to understand my situation and they thought I should rely on myself. I was so frustrated because from my point of view, I didn't even rely on them and they made it sound like a huge deal. I couldn't cry at all, Damn, I don't feel like working tomorrow. I just don't know how to convince myself that I am capable of doing my job. I want to succeed but I see no future, I want to get more tasks from my boss but I don't think I'll be able to nail my job.

My thoughts change hour by hour, I can appear fine and just being kinda disconnected and then it'll switch into suicide mode really fast. I hate that this happens, and when I'm feeling up I can't explain how I feel when I'm down. I've tried writing my feelings out when I feel bad but then when I'm up it just washes me away. If i try to give them to someone to explain it i just break down and nothing makes sense. I have no idea how to ask for help and how to stay consistent with management strategies.

My GP is the obvious choice but I don’t want to lose his confidence and trust, especially given he’s the one whose been prescribing the medication.

Last year, I found out I was legally too late to abort an unwanted and unintended pregnancy. I was manipulated into keeping it, and I hate myself for it; I've never felt so empty or useless before. I never, ever wanted to have offspring, and--depsite what everyone's said--my feelings haven't and are not likely to ever change. Nobody seems to understand that. I feel so alone.I want a hysterectomy so badly. I was only allowed to get a c-section instead of a natural birth because of a single male doctor who didn't treat me like dirt. I've always been afraid of doctors, and I know that I have to see one to get the surgery, but I also know that the chances of any doctor allowing me to have that kind of medical autonomy is ridiculously low. The prospect of getting a hysterectomy is the only thing keeping me around, but I don't want to ""blackmail"" anyone into doing it for me, either. It scares me I've come to terms with the possibility of getting shot down and the outcome of my actions if it doesn't happen.I hate myself for being born with a uterus. I hate myself for having sex. I hate myself for being so sad all the time. I hate being so worthless. I don't know what to do.My laziness is the only thing keeping me from acting on my thoughts, so I'm safe. Just aimless.

It started when my friend I've known since i was 15 (I'm 19 now) blocked me suddenly without a word. It really broke me because i was in love with him and when i finally confessed my feelings, he agreed to them and everything was fine Or so i thought. He never messaged me after that day so when i went to check up i found out he had blocked me. I panicked, was it because I'm trans? Was it the distance? I tried everything to get him back, messaging, re friending him but he wasn't accepting friend requests. I blamed myself for it and broke down in years because i enjoyed hanging out with him, we were close and i ruined everything by confessing.. After a few days though, i went to headspace to seek more help, i went to my first session but that didn't go so well, i felt very out of place so i left. I also tried kids helpline, but i felt like I had waited for so long i didn't even want to talk about my problems anymore so i gave up.. So here I am, I'm back to beyond blue for help once again. i just need something to make me feel better, I'm lying to my friends, saying that I'm okay because i don't want to bother them.

Suic-536,"I'm lost in this life, it's beyond understanding.","I am new here and just wanted to say hello...please help. I looked into ordinary chat rooms, but find the most sensible conversation comes from troubled folks who contemplate more than the superficial and the nonsensical. My life has reached a cross-road and I don't know where to turn. I have truly tried everything and have come to accept there is no answer for me. I live completely isolated, not by choice but because of life-long experiences, necessity and circumstances. I have no family–I think we are all an irreconcilable embarrassment to each other–or friends, who were ever only users and abusers. Relationships only last a short time, and I can't keep trying. There's no point. I don't fit in, have never fitted in, and my family of birth has the same affliction; but while they have dropped their standards in order to try to fit in with everyone but never achieving it, they have lost their self-respect and their true selves. I am trying to maintain my true self to represent my family. I think of it as my responsibility and I wouldn't be happy doing otherwise. I would love to work through this with a skilled psychiatrist, but I had one and he betrayed me in a way that remains life-threatening. I tried two others since, twice each, and they thought my situation humourous. I have no trust in therapists. Trust is earned and I see no reason for it when I see what is being termed 'treatment'. I am a dead woman walking and fight the urge to end my misery in recurring waves, daily. It is hell. That is what my detractors want.I am doing an online course that gives me a great deal of fulfillment, but socially, I have never found my 'fit'. I never will and I just don't know what to do.

Suic-537,I'm scared I'm going to kill myself,"Hey all, hope you're doing well I am afraid that I'm going to kill myself. I have had this suicide plan for almost half a year. There are many reasons, such as depression and anxiety for years, possible ADHD, dysfunctional relationships with friends, or friendships that seem to be going downhill, an emotionally abusive ex-girlfriend who turned a whole school against me, and failing grades that made me drop out, to try and pursue my ATAR next year as a year 13. I haven't got my license because I wanted to focus studying, so that another thing I'm behind all my friends in. I have felt lost, alone, depressed, and suicidal for months now, and have made a plan to get away from it all. It's not an attention thing, as I'm apprehensive about even writing to this forum in case people found out, and I also hate pain, pretty adverse to it, so self-harm is hard for me to commit to, even when I feel it would help.

Suic-539,Scared to tell my GP about self-harm,"Hello,I’m currently going through the family law system. My son’s father has been out of his life for many years now but his paternal grandmother has taken me to court. This is my second time going back as I am seeking to have the orders changed due to the abuse I have suffered from that family. I had my son when I was very young and he is almost an adolescent now. I feel I cannot escape the abuse I suffered from his paternal family and am being re-triggered by past trauma and do not feel free to live my life how I choose. It feels like being in an emotional prison where I cannot escape the cycle of abuse. I have been a great mother to him and there’s never been any question about my ability to raise, love and care for him. Even though his father is not involved, I am still being bullied, spoken down to, lied about and slandered by the paternal grandmother and the court is telling me I have to continue to send my son there even though I am concerned he is being exposed to the same abuse I was as a child in that home due to what he has told me. It is extremely psychologically damaging to feel as though you can’t protect your child and your rights as a mother are being stripped from you. I am so exhausted and my mental health is at an all time low. I’m missing work, I can’t complete my studies, my relationship with my partner is strained. I’m so anxious I feel like I can barely leave the house and I am starting to feel without hope. I don’t know how to talk to my doctor about self-harm and the thoughts of suicide. I don’t want to die but I feel like I cannot escape and I am at the end of my rope. I’m scared it will hurt my family law matter to be honest about my mental state and I’m scared they will force me to go to hospital and my ability to parent will be in question. I cannot afford a psychologist and I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be very welcomed.

Suic-541,New school and mental health 😫,I moved three months ago to a new school. Just a Lill back story a year ago I wasnt going to school till late next month I hadnt been to school for a year or so cause of bullying and my mental health was detiriating rapidly. I was homeless for a while in a mobile home then when the address got put on file police dcj and everyone started turning up every day multiple times a day . I started to get really upset cause I didn't want to go to another school and they kept pushing and my mental health started getting worse again . They didn't know that I was suicidal cause of it but I started having bad panic attacks every time they came. Fast Forward to October 4th I woke up and before annyone turned up I decided to try and end my life dad took me to the hospital and he warned them the whole time I wasn't doing well but nobody listened till I ended up in hospital. About two weeks after they managed to get me to go to school and what I was under the knowledge that I'd be going part time silly me they made me go everyday burnt me out so I started wagging school. Fast forward to this year I was going to the school not Verry often then got lectured about my attendance and I broke down Infront of the welfare teacher she didn't care cause she just sent me back to class . Now I'm at another school and they are starting to ask questions as to why I'm still wearing jumpers and trackies and I just say I'm comfy in them but it's getting hotter and I'm not doing well cause I'm now waging at my new school and I've been told if I don't stop I'll be on a suspension warning and I'm not 100% sure but I think they know what happened last year the thing is I've come a long way but it just feels like everyone wants to care once you are in pecies and when your not they don't care I don't want to talk about my problems to the school cause then they will start treating me differently and they already are saying to me oh are you going to leave school next year and it's sorta upsetting cause I want to complete school but I don't cause I'm just not getting annything done . And I can't help but remember this comment that was said oh you can't just go to wellbeing and sit there cause you don't wanna go to class you have to actually have a problem and most of the time I have multiple but it's just in my head that no one cares unless something has already happened then it's too late,Ashara,Community Member,25-09-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/new-school-and-mental-health/td-p/547933

Then I felt negative, drunk alcohol and self harmed. My doctor knows too. My husband now has control of my medication. Quire rightly, but I hate not having control. I must admit if I had access, I'd probably do it again. Just to hurt myself, not something else. I've taken this week off work too, to try and feel better.

I have no friends. What should I do? I’m on medication and I’ve seen tons of psychologists but nothing seems to work.

Suic-550,I lose my free will when I'm not allowed to choose death,"With the family history of depression, I was so afraid of falling into depression but the more I worried about it the more it will grow out of control. First I could say to myself, it's just mood swing, everybody had bad experience, it will be ok, but it's not. The bad things happened in life triggered the depression that made me feel I could never get better again, I started to lose the basic will of living. It's no longer about the bad thing that happened in the past, it's about losing the will to do the simple things in life. Everything in life seems so difficult, I just don't want to be any part of it. Death become the only hope but it's forbidden in my religion. I started to question my religion, isn't Free Will the gift of the universe? When I cannot choose death means I lost my Free Will. How did I come to this point? Smile, I need to live for the people I love, be strong be brave. But when will this end? I still got a long time to go, and who knows what's going to happen? Hell is better than depression because at least you know it's the worst known to human consciousness. I'm not afraid of hell but I'm afraid of not knowing when I can reach hell. God please save me, I don't want to hurt anyone who cares about me, but living like this is really made it difficult for people around me.

Suic-551,Struggling so much,"Hi,I don't know where to start. I am 54, father of two. Recently I have been hit by many issues at the same time. I live in QLD, but I have been working for 3.5 years in Melbourne for a company I co-created with others. It has been a very very long separation from my family, made worse by COVID and months-long separations in 2020, 2021. Recently, the work did not suit me anymore and I was eventually made redundant. Pretty much at the same time, my mum who lives in the Indian ocean on a little island called Reunion Island got very ill and I had to fly there in emergency. She almost died on me once barely 2.5 weeks ago, and in total went to ICU 3 times over the last 3 months. I think she is sorted out now; I have found an aged care center for her. Afterwards, I came back to Melbourne, packed my stuff, and drove back to Brisbane to find my mariage in tatters after a lengthy separation... All sorts of things that I had not taken time to process dawned on me in the last few days: How angry (in a vengeful way!) I was at my ex collaborators, how angry I was at myself for having imposed such a hardship to my family for the last 3.5 years, and then the double whammy of a struggling relationship with my wife. This is a lot to take on. I always have had issues of depression which I have tried to cope with to the best of my abilities for the last 25 years, using breathing techniques, meditation, sport, etc, having always managed to stay away from medications. Except for two weeks 13 years ago where I had to take myself to a psychiatric hospital. So that's me. I am back home with my beloved family, trying to mend things and resume my career. I think my big problem is that I am very impatient, and struggling with panic attacks (taking Saint John's Wort). In the last two days, I have felt everything dawning on me, felt overwhelmed and emotionally tapped out. At moments, I have felt like I wanted it all to end, without actually mentioning suicide yet. I had thoughts of suicide in the past, back in 2009, when I walked myself to a psychiatric ward. Right now, I can barely function. So step 1: function, step 2: reinsert myself in my family which has learned to go on without me for the last almost 4 years, step 3: forgive and move. Not necessarily in that order... Not sure... It's just the first few days. I take it a day at a time. Depression and anxiety is such a curse... I hate it...",FrnkFntn,Community Member,13-09-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/struggling-so-much/td-p/546855

Im uncomfortable talking out loud or to professionals im not sure i will get help but i do think ill lose the 3 people i do have very soon .

Suic-553,What next?,"Hello, I haven’t done one of these post things before so I am just going to go ahead and splurge my thoughts out. I am a 17yr old boy that’s about to graduate high school in a couple of weeks. I have been suffering from depression my whole life basically. From being bullied throughout my primary school years which created bad habits for me like being shy, isolation from everyone, and overthinking every life decision. Things only got worse when my parents divorced when I was 14 because my dad wasn’t feeling happy and decided to cheat on my mum. I went through years of pain mentally and tried so many things to try coping. I have been doing therapy for 3yrs and have been through 4 different therapists. I was prescribed anti depressants by my GP a year after my parents divorce, which has been changed either being moved up a dose or being completely a different type of depressant. I have struggled so much and I find it hard to tell people. I was able to tell my mates about everything that’s been going on but then idk what to do next. I am at the point of not knowing what to do next. I feel like I have tried everything to keep me distracted, and help me cope. But nothing works. I did a post years ago on a forum and I was only given replies that weren’t really helpful. And yes, I have attempted suicide, twice. First time I was able to stop my inner demons. Second time I was saved by a random stranger, I never saw again after the incident. I am just so lost and am really hoping that I can get some advice or just positivity or something because I am completely lost and confused.",Mysteryc,Community Member,12-09-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/what-next/td-p/546757

I’ve had a lot of time off of all work since I last posted, I’ve been in bed since which I’m not sure if it’s been a good or a bad thing for my mental health. I reached out to my Gp during an appointment for something separate, I felt it was the only way I could’ve said anything I don’t think I could’ve set an appointment specific for mymental health as Id be too nervous anyway. Unfortunately even after asking for a mental health plan, we had to address the more pressing concern (and injury the reason I was in there) first so it was brushed off. I know it wasn’t his fault and it was my bad timing but it took a lot for me to ask for help in the first place and I don’t think I can do it again. I know I can’t stay in bed everyday for much longer, I’m not sure why my family doesn’t just make me. (I know it’s not their responsibility and I don’t blame them) I’m sure seeing someone lay in bed 24/7 doesn’t strike them as normal. this I honestly more of a rant post which is why it’s so unstructured I’m just out of options at this point. another part of me thinks that because I didn’t set another appointment with my Gp for my mental health so soon after I mentioned it to him I’m not unwell enough, I’ve managed to survive this long that he will think that i obviously don’t need a plan. Maybe I don’t?

I've tried to hold it together, I've been on so many medications over the 40+ years I lived with this, been admitted to the mental health ward, lets think, at least 5 times were my stay was greater than 3 weeks which is also when I was given the 4 courses of ECT, voluntarily, I will give any treatment a fair try in hope I might find some relief but nothing ever really helps, I'm just finishing the 4th Couse of ECT along with yet another med change so everything has changed except for the misery, it's just as strong, crippling and smothering, only difference now is ECT has wiped out so much memory that the wonderful woman I stay for is under more strain than ever because she has to keep telling me all the things I can't remember, I so wish she could see I'm just a lead weight around her neck as we sail full steam on the SS Titanic.

I’ve harmed myself before while on meds that just didn’t agree with me, and now that I’m not on any, the thoughts are ten times worse and near constant. The main difference is right now I can stop myself from acting on them whereas while on those meds it’s like I gave up control. The thoughts are always there though. Thinking about how I could do it. It scares me sometimes how often they’re there and that I’ve almost become used to it. Thinking about it now makes me feel sick. I don’t know what would help but I’m doing some more research.

I am experiencing severe side effects from the medication that I am taking, and absolutely nobody will listen to my concerns in regards to this. I clearly have no purpose here - so ending my life could be an option, although I don't want to do it. No one wants to be friends with me/be my boyfriend either because I am not NT. And before people ask, yes, I am seeking help for my Schizophrenia - from an excellent psychiatrist and psychotherapist. But unfortunately, my psychiatrist is moving on to a different mental health centre at some point in the near future and I am going to struggle again. I am hoping to seek psychological assistance from the head psychiatrist of the state, at my local mental health centre - boy aren't I lucky? On top of that, my mother is a perfectionist and my father has no understanding of mental health - even though they both suffer from it. I am often at fault for a lot of things - such as my parents drinking and gambling problems. I've also been reminded consistently that I need to move out of home so that I am basically not a nuisance to my parents anymore. I have been having nightmares about my mother and I arguing. I have self-harmed. I was bullied in school about my hair. I've been groomed and I had another man lead me on, making me believe that he had he liked me for me when really, he is a narcissist who has a ex-wife and daughter on the side. I have tried to be a bit more extroverted, to no avail. I am sick of being rejected. I also tried receiving closure about something from a psychic medium.

Suic-563,"Mens emotions, sledging, bullying and toughening up","Society is broken. Here we are well into the 21st century and after more than 4 decades of effort by many including this organisation and we still have elements of our communities that hold the view that men should ""harden up"". I like AFL footy. Last night there was an incident that, from what we are told, was a sledge on the field by the Brisbane captain to a Melbourne player. So bad was the words that the victim was uncontrollably emotional, crying and red faced. At the end of the game the Brisbane abuser appeared to apologise and it seemed half accepted. An investigation will commence. Today the topic appeared on Facebook. The comments were appalling. -""you're among men now, you're not playing under 12's, harden up""- ""you got the age wrong, more like you're not in the sandpit""- ""Harden up. Afl isn't for you lad. You wouldn't have lasted in the 80s or 90s"" So, if you cry you shouldn't play footy. If you cry you are immature so, you shouldn't play with the real men. If you cry you should harden up. How do you harden up? Besides, why should you harden up? So I did reply in that I mentioned the men suicide total for 2020 was 2384 and the road toll for males and females was 1094... less than half.

I dont venture into that day in 1996 very often or it becomes non productive. I had been abused for 11 years. I have bipolar, depression and dysthymia. How did I survive? Endurance Not everyone has my endurance and I'd say that quality has been the top reason for my survival. But how have I used endurance? We often mention distraction on this forum to be used in many situations like deflecting trauma, moving your thoughts onto other things. A very good tool. Well my endurance was made easier through distracting myself from the trauma at hand.Medication Purely a topic for your professional medical person but I decided early on that I was unique and therefore would not take much notice of what I ""should"" be on. I perfected my meds with the help of my Dr especially with dosage. This was a regular assessment over many years and to get it right in the end was truly worth the perseverance. Follow your fitment For me I was a city kid that enjoyed holidays on relatives farms. So at 17yo I left the city to join the defence. Eventually I's settle in a country town. This was very important for me. Environment is important to fit into.Employment Being unstimulated in your work can prolong depression. To seek out your ideal job likely needs commitment in education, a double edged situation. In some work, on the job training is better suited. I found 2 or 3 part time jobs were better than one full time. 8 hours working with the same people tested my limits. Refuse shift work.Sleep I needed a CPAP. Quality sleep is essentialSelf praise Fact is, we need praise but rarely get it. Give it to yourself. Be your best friend. Reject the destructibles There is a high percentage of people in society that will not serve you well. Be wary, be choosy, pick your friends and family that are a benefit to you. Enjoy Love life. Watch a flower bloom, a bee seeking nectar, buy a puppy. The basics are worth your focus.Give I feel we are on this planet to give to others but you should have a limit. Too much giving leads to giving to some that will take advantage. Be wary and ""charity begins at home"". Any input?

Suic-570,"Thoughts about self-harm, past struggle with suicidality","Hi, So I'd like to preface this by saying that I have really struggled with speaking candidly about my suicidal thoughts. But recently, I witnessed someone speak about their addiction before an audience and I really admire their strength so I'd like to replicate that to the degree that I'm comfortable with in my own life. Apparently my comfort zone only allows anonymity so I'll roll with that, I guess... I have been diagnosed with depression and have struggled with it since the age of 11. I have always downplayed my struggle because I didn't want people to pity me or worry too much. And to some extent, I never been able to truly allow myself to acknowledge my struggle because I have a cushy life. My parents have good jobs and on the surface everything is perfect. I have a close relationship with my mother who has always welcomed me to be vulnerable and talk about my struggles, I have been reminded by members of my social circle that this kind of relationship with an immigrant parent of my cultural background is like having struck gold and it is quite true. I am incredibly grateful and that's part of the reason I feel like I am spoiled and perhaps haven't faced much in life and maybe I'm complaining when I should be thankful for how loved and cherished I am. Onto my suicidality, I often fantasise about suicide and how I would do it. Because I am worthless. I deeply hate myself. I am ashamed to say that I came close to self-harming last year. I have so many reasons to hate myself that I often wonder what it is that is holding me back. Is it family? Friends? Or my cowardice? All I see when I look in the mirror is someone who is undeserving of her life. To add to my amazingly low self-esteem, is the fact that I am not straight. Queer is the label I prefer but bisexual also works. I'm from a Christian family so I would literally be a social pariah if I ever came out. I can't really imagine myself in a relationship and I also identify as ace to an extent.

Suic-571,no life direction,"im kinda stuck. like i was stationary in my life, then i got going, and then i got stuck. iv have seen people talk about how hard they have it and i think and i unreasonable for telling myself im struggling. i have been suicidal for almost 2 years now and nobody knows. i have social anxiety, weather its severe, disorder or nothing, i dont know but i know i am hopeless in social surroundings. i umpire in local afl but in the goal but i would like to be a field umpire. im way to anxious to talk to players and make decisions that they wont like. i dream of being one though. i dream of being an extravert. i never had a girlfriend and i always dreamt of being so confident like the other guys. since graduating school i have struggled with friendships and the anxiety has gotten worse. when covid started i started writing music and i want to be a full time musician some day. but recently i lost interest in music all together and i cant understand why. im exhausted all the time now. i mean i did just get a job, but that didnt help my happiness. idk if depression or anxiety or im just an idiot for thinking i have problems. how long can one last whilst silently suffering. not long i suspect",rocketman__,Community Member,22-08-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/no-life-direction/td-p/544584

Suic-575,I have run out of hope,"Background info: M, 40y/o. I live with my Mum; we both have complex health issues that are NOT being adequately managed by our doctors. *I had to pare this post down to 2500 characters from over 7000. A LOT of detail has been lost* I am suffering from a condition that appears likely to be Narcolepsy type II. I also have several other physical and mental health problems. My main symptom is a permanently reduced level of wakefulness/alertness. This has gradually worsened over 27 years. Until two years ago it was relatively manageable. Last year a Sleep Specialist suddenly stopped the only medication that had been helping me a little. She COULD have done this in a kind and understanding way but she deliberately made things as traumatic as possible. I had already been suffering from Demoralisation Disorder due to previous stressful incidents with doctors; the incident last year has caused full-on PTSD. I CONSTANTLY relive that situation, dozens and dozens of times a day. And it gets stronger and stronger... I am supposed to be caring for my Mum, especially as her health is deteriorating also, but she is looking after me more and more and it is draining the little health and strength she had left. I feel so TERRIBLE. Before Dad passed away, he made me promise I'd look after Mum. That was the only thing he asked of me. And I can no longer do it. I am a failure. An absolute failure. The final straw came last week when I had an appointment with another Sleep Specialist to get the results of my recent Sleep Study. He gaslighted me and said there's nothing wrong. I give up. Nobody listens and nobody cares. Nothing works. I can't get any answers, I can't get any help. I have tried nearly twenty antidepressants with ABSOLUTELY no benefit from any of them - probably because my problems are neurological and psychological, not psychiatric. I've been feeling suicidal and don't feel very supported by my healthcare professionals. I cannot tell my Mum how I feel as she is very religious and I know she would not react well. My current state of mind is ABSOLUTELY hopeless. All I want is to feel OK again. But every day things get worse... I have lost everything. I used to be smart. I used to be good at solving problems. But not any more. My brain is dying more and more each day. I do not understand why I can not get help. I have tried SO HARD, for SO LONG... and all for nothing. I am done.",HopelessLes,Community Member,21-03-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,110,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-have-run-out-of-hope/td-p/16400
Suic-576,Correctional Services toxic workplace,"Hi everyone, I’d like to tell you my story of how I was a victim of workplace bullying. I worked for the department of correctional services in a high security prison. I have been with the department for well over 7 years and have seen some very interesting things. I’m a 6 ft 31 year old man of aboriginal heritage. During my years with the service, I have been assaulted, threatened to be killed, have had piss and shit thrown at me, all these things have happened to me but I accepted it as part of my job, dealing with the worst of society. But nothing has brought me to my knees as bad as being victim to cruel and inhumane workplace bullying at the hands of my work colleagues. Just recently my ex girlfriend had taken her life due to circumstances I can’t comment on and it’s left me in a state of grief, thoughts of whether I’m to blame for her demise and could I have done more to help her. I had found some sort of level of peace and had come to terms with it after a few months. Until one day, I decided to have lunch at the staff, the first time I have been to the staff mess since the passing of my ex. I was sitting down enjoying a nice hot bowl of soup when my supervisor walks in. He immediately begins to crack his jokes and dark humour, takes one look over at me and says “Geez mate, you’ve got a pretty shit track record of women” and I pause and say “How’s that mate? To which he replies “Well you’ve gotten one pregnant and ya last one killed herself” those words completely breached my thick skin and cut into my soul, it was as if I was glued to my seat, I couldn’t move I couldn’t speak when all I wanted to do was get up and leave. To end this conversation my supervisor laughs and said “I bet you raped her to? I was In complete and utter shock! I knew this man for 7 years of my working career in corrections, he was like a mentor, a friend, a brother whom I had confided in during the loss of my ex. He used it all against me to grandstand himself in front of all our peers at the staff mess. I wrote him up the next day which is a cardinal sin according to the Blue shirt code. It still hasn’t given me peace and has caused nothing but anxiety and worry! I can’t sleep and I’m not eating, I feel so on edge all the time. I’m hoping this investigation will give me clarity.

Suic-577,Young daughter has self-harm activities and suicide thought constantly.,"My daughter is 13 yrs old. Late last year, she had a bully from a dancing teacher aid. Then her temper has changed a lot within this half year. She is ok at school, but eaily getting mad at home. From early this year, we have found serveral cutting scars on her arm, and discovered that she has suicide thought for a while. At the moment, she is struggling with night sleep, and always worries about her body weight. We have tried to ask for some help, but she is reluctant to see any phycologist for support. She is not sharing anything with parents, and always lock her up in her room when she is not happy. Recently she had a big argument with me (dad) and does not want to talk to me anymore.

Suic-579,It shouldn’t be this hard,"Hello I am struggling to find hope and I don’t know why it is so hard. I have just come out of a long term relationship with the man I thought I would end up with. I moved cities, forgave lies, forgave him when he left me in a room to do drugs while I had an abortion, calling the police while I had a cigarette to avoid his alcohol psychosis - due to the constant begging for forgiveness and the empty promises. All of it took years of recovery and ended when he told me he couldn’t deal with his actions and he wasn’t okay when he entered the relationship. He tried still but I couldn’t be with someone who was unsure he could be with me and wanted to set himon a path to find his happiness as he expressed. A bruised ego shows no soul and no respect, or so it seems. I now find myself leaving the home I created with nowhere of my own to go, a career that suffered at the expense of his and am now being sexually harassed at work. I have no energy left to keep on trying. I tried for so long. Why won’t this end? All I can think about is the peace of death but my family would never recover. I don’t really know what I’m asking for other than a safe space and hopefully some helpful words, because I can’t go on like this. everyday I think about death and every day I breathe, I feel like the oxygen is almost gone",allthecolours,Community Member,10-08-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/it-shouldn-t-be-this-hard/td-p/543010

Probably don’t need to embellish but totally put on the spot to go voluntarily or they would take that decision away as well. Don’t know why they call it a choice? To say I was a tad upset is an understatement so here I am for the past 3 days In a perfectly safe room that I cannot believe how much thought they have put into avoiding incidents. I have been studied like a bug and I found it extremely unsettling when I can normally bluff my way through things. The staff seem nice but there are some really scary people hence I have remained in my room. The tablets have helped a bit with sleep so I’m hoping to go home today.

Suic-585,So sad,"I'm a lurker here, bit hard to be not ""to dark"" when your whole existence seem one dark place but I read the threads here and I know exactly how much pain the author is in, to me it's just so clear and like I have read in the threads just like me they cant get the physiatrist, doctors or anyone who hasn't lived this curse to understand just what a hell it is, when a day misery seems like forever and a week, month,and in my case years is countless forever's. Mine is a chemical imbalance, had it 40+ years, no hidden traumas, no dark events but the despair and misery are very real. Sometimes I luck out and a med will help for awhile, 1 med even gave me some years where I actually thought ""gee I actually get why unaffected people are happy to be alive"" it was a revelation, it was fantastic, it was fleeting, Like all the other drugs before and after, they became ineffective, I've literally forgotten the names of all the different drugs I've been on, lateral ECT [or was it bi lateral, I get them confused now, I've had both] certainly helped with that, wiped great heaps of memory, cant remember great tracks of time, I see photos of our X-Mass 2020 holiday get away and nothing, no memory of it at all, On the + side I was suffering misery then to and since that whole time is gone I guess that means I must have been in misery a shorter time since I cant remember it. Next week they plan to put me in ward again and zap me multiple times the first 2 weeks and then maintenance zaps there after. it would be nice if it could buy me even a little respite but I've done it all before and still I'm here where I do know the misery, despair and pain all these poor authors feel, frankly, even though I keep fighting, trying and hoping I don't really believe there is any hope for me, 40+ years is just too long to hold on to hope, I really don't want to hurt my wife, she loves me, and I love her, 37 years married.",Roadsend,Community Member,02-07-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/so-sad/td-p/24450

I wouldn’t be here today if I didn’t have my dog. After the last disaster in my life, I was suicidal for a year.... met no guys for almost two years and after a lot of time and self healing, I started to date again. After a lot of duds, I started dating a guy I originally met many years ago... everything was great and we became official and I thought he was going to be one of the ‘nice guys’.... I even said to my mum that I could see myself marrying him... how wrong I was... only as of two nights ago, i walked in on him with another girl... I never in a million years thought he could or would do that to me... it took me so long to finally open up to someone again and my trust has been completely shattered. I noticed some red flags and sadly I was right. For me, it was a tidal wave of emotions that flooded back from all my ex’s and past trauma... sadness, anger, betrayal, embarrassment as I had told my friends how great he was... I’m shattered beyond words... I’m soon to be 36 and I was looking for a husband... time is ticking away fast and the thought of starting over AGAIN for the millionth time is almost unbearable. I am glad I found out now and not further down the track, but it’s shattered me. I self harmed for the first time in a really long time and suicidal thoughts are coming in again thick and fast... I thought I had become strong, but yesterday proved otherwise. I had to call lifeline after a breakdown and I walked myself down to the police station to save me from myself. I don’t want to stay single, but I don’t know if I can go through this ever again. All I’ve ever wanted is someone to love me as much as I do them and I continue to get used and played.

The GP recommended me a few things like breathing exercises, grounding and even using a rubber band to snap on my wrist I know it’s not been long but the rubber band snapping sort of helps me but I find my self getting really snap happy if the feeling is bad then it stings for awhile after I struggle to focus on things I want to enjoy or did enjoy like programming, drawing I just lose focus within a few seconds to a minute even if I really want todo it then I get really agitated and upset at myself People say if you are unsafe to go to a hospital but my last experience was traumatic I know what I heard, a nurse saying I wasting there resources and if I was going to do it I would just do it, but now I’m questioning if that was a delusion from not sleeping in over 48 hours and that’s making me question if I’m attention seeking even though I hesitate to tell anyone how I feel, hospital investigated the complaint my GP lodged and they ended up apologising for how I was treated but even with that I don’t think I could ever go to one again even for a physical emergency, eg I was choking 2 weeks ago I forced my self to clear it my self was really scary but I’d choose that option over asking for help. I try to plan my words and actions carefully to avoid a hospital visit at all costs now thanks for reading my vent",Skippy_07,Community Member,14-11-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,40,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/just-need-to-vent-in-a-safe-place/td-p/28325

Suic-599,I was doing so well... but I relapsed :(,"HEY GUYS, this post might be triggering to some, I'm just In search of some advice. I'm in my early 20's and for the second time in the space of a year and a half I have attempted to take my life. My 2nd attempt was 4 days ago and I am currently still in hospital. As soon as I woke up I have been determined to get to the bottom of what has just happened. I am so confused and scared because after the 1st attempt I have worked so hard to get where I am and I was so proud of my growth. I didn't think I was capable of doing this again. I am diagnosed bipolar and on anti psychotic medication. The first time round long story short. Was in a reallly bad relationship couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, no self worth, I hated myself. I thought I was the worst person in the world and all I did was hurt people. When I was in that rock-bottom I genuinely thought I would be doing everyone a favour. I survived and I am so lucky to have had my family and friends to support but I'm so lucky to have the strength I did to get myself where I am now. Since I have done a bit of travelling. Backpacking for 6 months, now have landed in place I could settle for a bit got myself a really good job in retail and another job in a bar was living in a hostel having fun! For 3 weeks I have been here. Loving it. But the other day? I was drinking with friends had an amazing afternoon a fun night. Then I lost my wallet. Was searching for my wallet then all of a sudden got this overwhelming feeling and all of a sudden I was feeling exactly like I was the day I made my 1st attempt. And In a split second ... I'm here. I now have to go home unfortunately, but I'm happy I get to see my friends and fam from home. I am in search for DBT I have heard that is good? I'm sad about the situation but I am.more hopeful then anything, I want to live, I love life. I don't want this to happen to me again.

When i think about these things, i get tense, i pinch myself or scratch myself, but nothing that causes scars or marks. the thoughts sometimes appear randomly, but mostly appear when i'm in a weird mood and i'm in a situation where i feel suffocated and stressed. Sometimes they appear when i'm angry, but that rarely happens.

Suic-603,Psychosis stole my art skills and my will to live.,"I had devastating manic psychosis June 2020. After coming out of the ward I noticed my art skills alone were absolutely destroyed. I need to say that I was a professional artist before my accident. I did animation work for Dreamworks and Netflix shows and went to a prestigious internship and school prior, but my whole life I had gotten this far by working hard.Now however, I can barely do a sketch and the sketches always came out wrong. I am losing my ability to communicate this because I'm so upset. This is NOT creative deficit (aka. laziness) like many bipolar people say they have post mania. This is genuinely some cognitive issue keeping me from doing the fine decision making that it takes to be ME-level good at art. I can't attach an image of how I used to draw, it wont let me.I kept hoping these last two years that I'd see improvements. Sometimes I saw glimpses or so I thought, but they always end up as mediocre, broken and lumpy drawings. But art is subjective right? Other people in my life have told me my art looks fine. They have told me to be more 'well rounded'.Yeah tear off a butterflies wings and tell it to go do something else.It was my favorite thing and opened up the world. I'd draw at cafes, draw on trains and trams, doodle in class and create massive elaborate pieces late into the night when I was at home. I wont discard how art has shaped me my whole life. Art was breathing. Art was joy.Since my accident, I had to give up seeking freelance work, since I plain and simply couldn't damn do the work at the speed and skill level required. I hoped for a recovery, but until this day my drawing hasn't regenerated. I struggle, my brain gets tired. It just isn't high quality anymore. It's destroyed my self esteem, as everyone I know can see I'm worthless now. My psychiatrist hopefully isn't lying to me when he says I don't have brain damage and that it's just a matter of healing. Still I spent countless hours Googling trying to find information. Weirdly enough I can walk and talk and be me, just without the cognitive ability to draw.Maybe I just want to tell my abridged story, for some dingus doctor to get their act together and start helping people maybe? I'm seeing my psychiatrist in two weeks, it is never when I need it. I wish I could trust his words that I'll get better, but the world is unbearable and my head is screaming for escape.",Retronoodles,Community Member,13-07-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,5,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/psychosis-stole-my-art-skills-and-my-will-to-live/td-p/539760
Suic-604,Hamster on a wheel,"I have not posted for some time. Unsure if this will be a one off or not.

Not working for most of the body but some relief in the area targeted. Challenges both personal and work related are still hurtling at me, faster than I can manage but somehow the body moves on each day. Pain on average is between 7 to 9 each day. Depression off the scale. Some reduction in suicidal thoughts perhaps due to new medication perhaps not. Conversation continues with psychiatrist and I do believe he cares and is working to provide support. Yet again however I find myself struggling to take the medication. I plan to email him about this over the weekend. It gives him time to consider things before we talk.

Suic-608,Life after an attempt,Hi there First of all thanks so much for taking the time to read this. My husband and I have been struggling with our relationship since lockdowns began. I thought moving to a more rural place in Victoria would be more peaceful and help our relationship but I was wrong. We moved last year as the 6th lockdown happened during winter. At first everything was exciting. I am living with bipolar and hadn’t experienced depression in years then suddenly I found myself very isolated. My family and friends are now miles away. Last year August I saw two psychiatrists and asked for a medication change they said no. My depression became really bad and January this year I attempted suicide then again in April. I’m not suicidal at the moment just wanting to get better. My medication has finally been changed and my husband and I are finally getting couples counseling especially for our little toddlers sake. The real issue is I’m totally isolated where I live with limited opportunities I feel very unhappy here in this million dollar home that I can’t stand because we now have money troubles with the rising cost of living. My husband loves it here but I’m miserable and wanting to move back to where we were living and have half the mortgage and money stress. I also want to move back to be closer to family and friends but fear my husband will resent me if we move back. I honestly don’t know what to do. My husband said he will move back but he’s not happy about it because it means sitting in traffic again and possibly changing jobs and I don’t want him to go through that. At the same time I can’t bare to be here. I applied for work I got told the next day they won’t be moving forward with my application I feel very limited where I am what should I do? My husband doesn’t think it’s the place it’s me that’s the problem. Feeling devastated. Moving here is a big regret for me personally. I would just like things to go back to what they were before the pandemic.

Suic-610,Surviving suicide,Hi I’m a survivor of suicide. I wanted to share my story so here goes. I have had depression and anxiety for most of my life due to trauma from when I was young. Unfortunately this dictates a lot of what I can and can’t do in my daily life. This all lead to the breakdown of my marriage. I know now that I put a huge strain on my wife and for that I will allow feel guilty. after my marriage ended I entered the darkest depressive episode of my life. I lost hope and the will to continue. I spent most of my time in bed because I could not see any reason to leave it. This went on for a month. At this point I tried to end my life. I felt awful both in my body and mind. I was so full of anger that it hadn’t worked. I don’t know what happened to prompt me to call my friend but that’s what I did next. I broke down on the phone to him. I’m still in hospital today as I write this. After I got through emergency I was taken to the psych ward. It took me a few days to open up to the team here but I have been following there process and I can feel myself getting better. I don’t know what tomorrow will bring and I’m scared of going back out into the world but I’m learning to cope. Today I felt brave enough to write down my story and share it with you. I will take that as a win.

She put an intervention order on me saying she was stressed, intimidated and scared about what I’d do to the kids. Although, I have not been violent to them and only took her bait after being kicked out over tiny things and threatened with harm and never seeing my kids again. Which has always been my greatest fear, now it’s come true. So I attempted again. It didn’t work. So now, I’m fighting for my kids and myself.

Suic-613,Am I suicidal?,"Hi, So lots of the time I just hate life, I hate being where I am but not I don't want to run away. I wish that I could just float in the black abyss that is space. Lots of the time I feel like the people around me would be better off if I was gone, that no body would care if I ran away or died. That maybe they would be happier if I just went away. I can imagine everyone in my life not caring or moving on easily if I died, besides my Dad. I don't have a plan as to how I would do it, and the thought of a slow death scares me. I don't want to kill myself but I want to die, if that makes sense? I have self-harmed in the past. After righting all of this I guess it does really sound like I am but I guess its just that I dont always feel like this. I am a 15 year old girl in Australia. I am usually really happy. As far back as I can remember I would be self-harming but it wasn't really until end of grade eight or nine that I started wanting to run away and then it turned into this. My parents are divorced and I live with my Dad, Step-Mum and little sister. I used to live with my Mum, Granny and Poppy, up until the end of grade 5 when I had had enough. She was a textbook narcissist and so was my Granny. We went to two shrinks and they both told me to get away from her basically, we stopped seeing each other and only called, then she got pregnant without telling me. Then I said I wanted a break so her only contact was a text on holidays and my birthday. She didn't text on Christmas and I haven't heard from her since. I have a lot of problems because of her and its also caused a lot of problems between me and my Step-Mum. I thought I should say this because it plays into a lot of my stuff. So yeah, can someone please just help? I feel so trapped and suffocated, I dont really want to talk about this to my Dad because I am afraid of... I dont really know what, how he'll react? I get so afraid of what people think. I am so afraid all of the time.

I guess that I have got to the point where it I want the pain to end, but I don't want to kill myself, I just want it to be over, if this makes sense. Most of the time I feel hopeless, and am losing enjoyment in things that I used to love. I often feel that I am just letting everyone down, and that no one would actually care if one day I just didn't wake up. I am confused that this may mean that I am suicidal. I have anxiety and depression and a couple of phobias, which make it really hard to live my life. I feel like there is kind off no point keeping on going, like I have no future and am not going anywhere in life. School at the moment is really bad, and it is making me feel worse about myself. There are days when I just spiral into despair, feel like this is never going to end. My parents try to help, but most of the time I just feel alone as they don't really understand what I am going through. To be honest, I don't understand what I am going through either.

Suic-616,Never been so lost (content warning: distressing themes),"I have been through a lot over the last couple of years and I don’t know how much more I can take. It all started ok and then over time my 25 yr marriage began to break down. One issue was I was never violent or confrontational which led to my ex making me argue and talk. Over time I focussed on the negatives including seemingly not being able to do anything right. Intimacy was lost barring maybe once a year or so. She told me she had no feelings down there after the children and didn’t enjoy it and I believed her and wasn’t one to push things. I then found a large stash of sex toys which when I questioned her she claimed they weren’t for personal use which I know is a lie. I also found a sticky note stuck to a toy with a work directors number on it that I never questioned her about. She also said something in bed which I never disclosed to anyone but wasn’t good. I turned to online porn and chatting to others. I went through the unexpected loss of my sister and a few weeks later lost my mum to dementia. My daughter announced on social media she was transgender and there were many other things happening at the time. I then did something that appals me to this day and others may feel that I don’t deserve to live. I have spent time in prison, thousands in counseling and a program I chose to do on the outside to help understand and prevent this happening again especially given my own experiences of abuse which some don’t believe happened. I feel like no matter what I do I will never be able to make amends. I recently was terminated from my dream job just because of rumours. I had started a new relationship 5 months ago and disclosed this to the lady I was seeing a few weeks in when it became obvious we were really enjoying each other’s company and things were moving forward. It was a difficult conversation to have but I didn’t want to hide it. The relationship was on and off for 5 months and despite her saying she would support me and saw me for who I was not what I did I don’t think she ever stopped worrying about what others would think if they found out and it has now ended. not enough room for everything but I feel worthless and world is better without out me and no one love me",LCS,Community Member,16-09-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,24,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/never-been-so-lost-content-warning-distressing-themes/td-p/21863

I absolutely know the devastation that my death would cause. I know that people care about me, I know I’m loved, I know that I have things to offer the world; so I am very confused about why I am feeling the way that I am. just wonder if anyone can relate or share their perspective of what’s happening for me right now.

But lately.. it's getting to the point where it is all I can think about. I don't know where this intense feeling has come from, or why it's gotten so bad, and honestly I'm terrified. These thoughts are interrupting everything; I can't sleep, I have little appetite, I can't focus at work or during my studies. I've been seriously considering admitting myself into a hospital - but I just can't bring myself to do it. I was taken to hospital for a similar thing just under a year ago.. but the difference was, someone took me basically against my will. The whole time I was there, I felt like I shouldn't have been.

Suic-624,I’m tired of the fighting the voice inside of my head everyday,"It’s been almost 3 years since the break up of me and my partner of 5 years. We were childhood friends whose families knew each other. We drifted apart for about a decades before finding each other again and it all just clicked. It really felt like it was meant to be. It was love at first sight. She was everything I wanted in a girl. Beautiful, Smart, funny, caring, empathetic. She’s a teacher who goes above and beyond for her students and even more so for those closest to her. I had everything going for me until I messed it all up by cheating on her with a fling from my past. I had on and off again formed an emotional attachment to this other woman who I had no feelings for, but because of my intimacy desire I kept gravitating back towards her. She was my first, the one I lost my virginity to so in a strange way I sort of felt indebted to her in some way. Sired if you will. We never did anything or met up. We talked openly and freely about intimacy topics, we reminisced about our times together and how we wished for a threesome someway somehow. My then partner had caught me in my lies and went through my entire message history with her. To say it devastated her was an understatement. The wool had been pulled away from her eyes. To her I was no longer the loving boyfriend but the man who had broken her heart after she had let down her walls. The man who had betrayed her trust and took her for granted. I will never forget the pain and anguish that I saw in her eyes that night. It still haunts me till this day. Everyday I wake up filled with regret that I hurt such an innocent, decent person who loved me unconditionally. I think about her all day and night, I think about how much I miss her and still love her to the point where my chest feels like it’s about to cave in. I’m so angry and torn that I could do such a thing to someone that I still love so much. I’ve never felt such long lasting pain in my life. Knowing that she’ll never take me back. Knowing that I got to live the rest of my life without her. She’s left such a mark on my heart that it feels impossible to let go. That’s why I cling onto this pain as a way to remind me of her even though it’s eating away at my soul. I’ve been to therapy and from what I can discern is that my need to seek that extra love and attention stems from my father walking away from me at a young age. It’s manifested into my desires in trying to find that love which is twisted when I think about it.",JoyBoy33,Community Member,16-06-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-m-tired-of-the-fighting-the-voice-inside-of-my-head-everyday/td-p/793

Suic-627,probably just puberty.,"why, just why. why do i have to feel like this? every night its ""your ugly nobody likes you. cut your wrists, run away."" those thoughts repeat over and over in my head. why? probably just puberty i guess. -but my life is fine at the moment. fine friends, fine mum. so why? maybe because of trauma? but that was 6 years ago why now? i don't even remember half of the stuff that happened. jesus, why do i have to feel like? maybe because the one time i told my best friend i was self harming she didn't seem to care? maybe because i don't have many friends? maybe because my face is absolutely ugly? probably just puberty. you know what's funny? i like being sad, not for attention i promise. but just when i'm alone in my room. when i'm sad i am more in the present than ever, i feel calm. i'm not trying to impress anyone i can just cry or sit there listening to music. being sad or 'emotionless' just lets me think. its as if my mind goes into this state of tiredness and self hate. where i'm the only one criticizing myself, where i'm the only one who can hurt me. but then i start to overthink everything. what if this is what death is like? sadness, empty minded, unable to feel but able to recognise hurt? only able to feel what we all truly feel. confusing huh? i guess. i mean i guess that's why i want to die so much. the thought of always being in a state of calm. nothing to worry about, no guilt. just nothing. sounds like a dream- well at least my dream. i guess im halfway there though. never showing much emotion, always tired. detaching myself from daily things. i dont know whats going on anymore, hell, i can't even remember simple things i just heard 5 seconds ago. i can't remember anything. i dont have anymore motivation. i've been down this hole before but of course, just ofcourse. i've had to fall in it again. guess holidays have really made me focus on whether life is that important to keep living for. although everyone says life is too short, then why does it feel like an eternity, why am i waiting for an end? i guess its just puberty. i wish i had more friends. no i'm not talking about being popular. i just mean 1-2 close friends who i know will be there for me like i would be there for them. i've told my best friend multiple times ""i'm here if you ever want to talk"" when do i get to hear that directed towards me. i don't tell anyone how i feel because they either make it about themselves or don't care.Who knows it's probably just puberty.",Lazy,Community Member,08-07-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,9,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/probably-just-puberty/td-p/16290

Please feel free to post below because I want to hear yours, and I want this to be a thread where people who come here can grab onto a reason too. The reasons why I chose to stay - - My dogs. - Planning to die was very complicated. - I wanted to hold on just in case things got a little bit better. and now, I'm glad that I stayed. Please know that while suicide will end the pain, it will end your life too - so you'll say goodbye to any opportunities that things might get better.

Suic-631,How to talk about thoughts of self-harm and maybe death,"Hey, first I am safe right now. I am not thinking of things right now, and whenever I have thought about it I haven't gotten close to doing things, I'm able to take a step back and stuff. I could be in a better spot but that's the idea. So, I have a GP appointment coming up and I know what things I need to say. Namely that I am thinking the things I am, and it's affecting my ability to look after myself, paticularly taking far too much effort to eat food. But the conversation scares me, I had to talk myself out of cancelling yesterday. Doesn't help that I'm so low energy and my GP isn't exactly local. She's a great GP though, I couldn't have imagined telling any of my prior GPs I was feeling this way, and I have seen more than a few gps in these 20ish years. So I shouldn't go to a new one just to not have to deal with a long commute. But yes, I have no idea how to talk to such a supportive GP about this. How do I say things, how am I framing them? Most google results are how to talk to someone you think is suicidal, not what to do as the suicidal person so I guess I was just hoping for some perspective. Ultimately, if I don't know what I'm doing I can go to my GP and say ""hey I don't know how to say this but I'm struggling to eat or see a future"". I'm framing this as a question but ig im just hoping someone's able to share their perspective and that might help with nerves. Also I tried to talk to a friend about this and, well I did everything I could without saying it to check they could have that conversation. But once they knew what it was about they weren't able to be there for me. And, I can accept that I'm just worried about them. I can imagine they don't feel great about having to say ""sorry I can't do this"" and.. yeah. If anyone has any thoughts on that too. If I can do anything for them.",CaramelCrisp,Community Member,11-03-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,31,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/how-to-talk-about-thoughts-of-self-harm-and-maybe-death/td-p/28507

Recently I’ve not been feeling so great, I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ocd, bpd and autism. In the past I’ve had self harm issues and I am trying so very hard to stay clean. But I woke up this morning and cannot keep my mind clean. Everything is overwhelming and I am so very depressed that I didn’t want to get out of bed. I live with my bf and he hasn’t been much help which has made me spiral even more. I can’t stop my mind from telling me things that I know aren’t true. But it feels pretty shit that my bf would rather play games and talk to his friends than sit with me while I’m in a dark period. The only thing that’s made me slightly happy today is my dog he is great and won’t leave my side. But I’m trying so hard not to slip up and self harm. My life just seems like it has no purpose at the moment which makes the depression even worse. I’m embarrassed to talk to people about it because I’m worried they will judge. I love my bf but I can’t help but feel a little bit neglected right now because of the roles were reversed I would do anything in my power to make sure that he was okay and it feels pretty sh*t that he won’t do the same for me. I’ve tried talking to my friends about it but they all judge him straight away and say I would be better off without him but they don’t know him the way I do. He’s normally super supportive so I don’t know what’s changed. I just want him to prioritise me for once. Especially since I told him how depressed I am. I feel like he never takes me seriously and it’s hard to not spiral even further down. I am trying so very hard not to slip up because I am a week clean from self harming but my substance abuse issues are far from okay.

I’ve battled with anxiety (no meds, no formal diagnosis) all my life, and I have an impossibly high bar for myself. If I make one mistake in something, my whole life may as well be a failure. I’m not like this with other people, just me; my standards for myself far exceed any I would hold those around me to. I am very fortunate in life, which just makes me feel even worse (like I don’t have a reason to feel this way.) I have a wonderful and loving husband, a very supportive work environment - so any time I feel I can’t go on I end up being even more mean to myself, like there’s people with real problems who aren’t as much of a downer as me. It’s so hard to battle this inner self critic though. That part of me is so strong, and so mean. Nothing I ever do is good enough for myself. I live in a constant state of comparison, and find myself lacking or coming up short at every turn. I often wish for really horrible things to happen to me so that I would either not feel like this anymore, or at the very least be able to give myself a break. I do see a counsellor (last 6 years), and she thinks the way I berate myself comes from my parents and my poor relationship with them; I’ve taken over their criticism as I’ve grown, kind of thing. The struggle for me is that I’ve got all this in life now that should make me happy - my husband, my job - but I still feel like I’d give it all up in a heartbeat if it would take this pain away. That’s so selfish of me, but I would rather have never been born (even if it meant never having met my husband, who is the best thing to ever happen to me) if it meant that I didn’t have to feel like this and fight so hard just to keep going in the wake of all this self criticism. I’m 30 right now and when I picture the future, instead of imagining nice things, all I feel is dread. I can’t do another 30 or 40 years of this battle - I’ve been doing it since my teens and I’m already completely drained. If anyone out there can give me some advice about how I can move forward and start truly enjoying my life, I would be forever grateful.

I’ve suffered depression, anxiety, Endometriosis, bulimia on and off and back issues since I was 15 (now 38) and I’m so tired of pain. Physical and emotional. I can’t escape it. Things get good for a while and then they go back to being hard just as quick. It feels like life is a constant struggle and I find little joy in anything anymore. Im finding it hard just to do the grocery shopping right now as I don’t want to see anyone and I can barely communicate with even my family. Ive lived with mental health issues long enough to know that people have an empathy limit and so I’ve shut myself off from almost everyone. Relationships and people are just too hard. I have 4 kids who are the only thing keeping me going and I hate what I am putting them through. I have severe sleep disruption and don’t want to get out of bed. I can’t get through a night without having a drink and I make myself sick almost every night after dinner. Knowing I will die one day is the only thing that gives me comfort but I can’t actually bring myself to do it because I am afraid I will fail. I’ve thought about it almost every day this year and nearly attempted over Xmas. I’ve seen so many therapists and medical professionals in my life and I’m still feeling like this.

Suic-645,Don't know why I'm like this...,"I'm struggling with the fact that I don't have an explanation for why I have suicidal thoughts/tendencies and it makes me feel like I'm being a complete and utter idiot for wanting to end my own life for ""no apparent reason"" , which ends up spiraling into self hatred for being so ""weak"" and ""useless"" among other things. I was 13 when I first harmed myself and now 16 years later at the age of 29, I still can't figure out why it all started despite having done it multiple times now. I've seriously thought it out over the last 16 years but can never find the reason for why I want to just end everything so badly. I just end up getting slapped in the face with feelings of ""I don't want to live anymore"" and then having a mental breakdown of sorts over it, which I overcome through self harm. It's never been to the point of being life threatening and I know that self harm even when minor is a bad coping mechanism but I can't seem to get out of that headspace without doing it. I've thought about calling or using the online chat to talk to someone when I'm going through my suicidal breakdowns but I can never bring myself to do it. Simply because I feel like I would just be wasting that person's time when they could be helping someone else who is truly struggling instead. I'm losing my motivation to keep moving forward... When I was younger, I used to convince myself that the suicidal tendencies was 'just a phase' and that I'd get over them as I grew older but now that belief is gone and now the only two things that are still keeping me here are 1. My fear of having to face my family's reaction if I survived the attempt to take my life and 2. My outstanding bank loans as I don't want my family to repay them on my behalf if I do succeed. My reasons for hanging on make me feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and am seriously hating myself over the fact that I want to end my life without even having a valid reason for it...

Suic-647,Anxiety and medication,"Hi everyone, Since being put on an anxiety medication 4 years ago for depression, I have developed severe anxiety, I never suffered from anxiety before this and was able to cope with my depression by wearing what I describe as a mask, I had a stable job that i excelled at and had a wide network of friends. While being on this medication I have resigned from my job of 14 years and left my marriage and have no friends left, I self isolate at home with my dogs and only leave when I absolutely have to, even then I take the path of least resistance, I now suffer from insomnia with never ending ruminating thoughts, in all honesty I'm exhausted and so lonely. My home is a safe haven where I don’t have to fake anything, but it is a catch 22, the more I isolate the more I feel disconnected from the world, even putting the rubbish bin out terrifies me in case a neighbour sees me and what’s to have a chat so I put the bin out at 9pm well after my neighbours have. I was never this person that I am today I loved life and spoke to everyone and anything, to people who knew me back before taking medication would say that I was always full of life and always smiling and made people laugh and probably my energy was a bit overwhelming for people that didn’t know me. But now I just sit at home cocooned in a protective shell from the outside world feeling like anxiety is who I am and it is what I deserve. In all selfish when Covid hit I wasn’t concerned as self isolation is what I’m used to and thought to myself this is what I deal with everyday and in a way I was happy that other people had to do what I deal with everyday, selfish isn’t it. I have tried to speak to my psychiatrist about changing my meds but he is so dismissive and thinks it’s just me, I have tried slowly tapering of this medication and then developed suicidal thoughts, in all honesty I’m at the end of my tether, I have no friends no support and a psychiatrist that thinks he knows best, has anyone else experienced severe side effects from taking anxiety medication?

Suic-650,Curious if anybody feels the same?,"Hi, I am new to the forums with only a few posts and to be honest, was unsure if I was even going to post on this topic but you all seem so understanding and compassionate that I have decided to do it. First of all, know that I am safe and not in any danger I just want to talk about my feelings and maybe see if I can get some clarity on things I've always been scared to talk about. I was suicidal numerous times in my teen years (I'm well into my 30s now) and well..okay so I've been to those quick ten set therapy sessions they hand out three times. Whilst I was able to talk some about losing my parents, I never got around to talking about this. I'm not sure I was even ready to and was scared if I said something they could take action even though I wasn't in danger at the time but my anxiety was making me a little paranoid about it. Anyway, I managed to keep my thoughts and such to myself for the most part and not go into a lot of personal details my parents eventually found out about what I will call my last attempt (I was 17). I guess I was expecting a hug and maybe some questions on why I would feel that bad that I wanted to end my life at that time, but instead, I was met with anger and what kind of felt like blame. Does anybody know why this reaction happened? I guess it's something I have always wanted some clarity on. I mean, I know it would have been a shock to my parents, but I wasn't expecting that reaction. Needless to say, I never spoke about my feelings again at least not to them and not in that way. I just internalised everything. The other thing I wanted to say is I've had feelings as an adult about it all it comes up sometimes yet there's thing knowing in me that I couldn't act on it so they end up just being mere thoughts but do others experience this? You know, the deep knowing that you can't do anything, you won't do anything, but yet the thoughts are still there and you kind of just sit with them until they pass? I'm just curious if anybody feels the same or perhaps could share their opinions or experiences on the matter?

Suic-653,Desperate for Psychiatrist assistance,"I am the mother of a 16 year old who has been suffering with anxiety, self harm and an ED over the last 2 years with excalating seriousness. Her care team consists of our GP, Paedatrition, Psychologist and a Dietatian. On Sunday my daughter ended up in the emergency room where it was confirmed there was a limited amount of damage to her liver. The toxocologist advised we needed to step up her care to include a psychiatrist immediately. This was supported by her psychologist and GP. Since this time I have approached every possible clinic and youth psychiatrist I can find. I have exhausted the lists provided by our GP, the hospital, recommendations and online searching. The responses range from 'books are closed', 'doesn't see youth', 'out of serviced region' or no response at all. I have even had the response ""if it gets worse then call the crisis line. I am feeling so desperate and without hope of finding the right specialist to assist my daughter. How is it we can get to the point in our society where we don't have specialists available to assist a suicidal teenager? Recent years have seen changes that now require adult administration of medications prescribed by a psychiatrist rather than GP's rather than stretching our specialist resources so thin they can no longer help the most in need? My ask of this group is twofold. 1) Does anyone have any tips or advice on how I can find a psychiatrist that could work with a 16 year old with the above conditions? 2) How do we work together as a community to convince the governing bodies that the current system is so heartbreakingly broken and there is a desperate need to review processes, policies and requirements required of these specialists - to free up their time to see the most in need.",Mumma_ST,Community Member,19-05-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,5,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/desperate-for-psychiatrist-assistance/td-p/21377

I thought since I had started and passed my first year of Tafe that I was past it but I couldn't have been more wrong when I started the second year. Since maybe the first week I've been absent for most classes, unable to pull myself together and it really honestly feels like I'm broke inside somehow. It's gotten to the point now that I've been told to withdraw from a class and that's honestly thrown me off the deep end into bad habits and even caused me to relapse. What's worse is that I feel I but others to blame when this happens when it's all my fault, and I hate the fact that I'm unable to talk about this to anyone around me irl, especially my parents, who I feel I've failed immensely and wasted their money and time with something they don't even know that's happening. Ill be safe, but I don't know to what end, I feel as if it'd be easier to end things, but then I'd feel as if that's selfish to others around me.

I cant even succeed in my suicide attempts. I recently battled Grade 3 triple-negative breast cancer. I survived but barely. I cannot cope. I am resisting the urge to hurt myself but I won't. I have 3 absolutely beautiful boys.I fought like hell for my life. I adore them and they need me. My husband&I have drifted apart. I feel so much shame over what I have done to him. He didn't know what he was in for marrying me. I made the ""best thing that has ever happened to me"" a shadow of himself. He had to keep the family going while I battled cancer. We lost our home and had to ""couch surf"" with family. We have been homeless ever since my diagnosis. We now live with my husbands side of the family to give my family a break. Living under the same roof with a family like mine, who has so many challenges causes major disturbance. I think I should leave. My husband cant stand me anymore. I see it in his eyes. He told me to go. Im destroying them. Honestly, I am. My husband said 6 words to me I will never forget ""YOU HAVE HURT MY LIFE""... and God, it's so very true. I am so disappointed with how I have turned out. I know - deep down - that the greatest thing I could do for the ones I love, is to remove myself before more damage is done. I'm a crap magnet and don't want the boys to know what that is like. I have looked at free campgrounds near by so I can be near my boys. I have no money. I have nothing. I don't even have a car to sleep in. I just have the clothes on my back and the love in my heart for my children. I wished I could nourish the love in my heart that I have for my husband but I can't even look him in the eye. I'm such a disgusting disappointment. The best thing I can do is remove myself so that my beautiful family can pick up the pieces without me causing more disturbance, but I was the victim of a house invasion and have terrifying fears of the thought of camping by myself.

Suic-667,How to reach out - for real?,"Hey everyone I hope you're all doing well So I've been struggling with anxiety/depression for a while and I've been going to a therapist and on medication for five years this year. It's good and it helped at first, but I've definitely become sorta stagnant with my progress and now things are regressing. Ive been in and out of severe depressive episodes since the end of 2019 and it's never entirely gone back to normal. At this point I've pretty much lost hope. I've been on and off suicidal for a couple years and I usually play it down when talking to people so as not to worry them. I've been told I likely am on the spectrum and have been screened for OCD and been told it's a high possibility, but no one is helpful. I've been two three psychiatrists and three psychologists and they've never taken the time to properly diagnose me with anything other than anxiety and gender incongruence. And even to get that took months and like five psychiatrist visits. I cannot go back to school. I cannot. I'm supposed to in a couple of days but I will just dissociate and become severely depressed again and I know that. I want to go to a psych ward for a couple weeks and see if it helps. I've read about it and I have friends who have been and really benefited from it, but my parents are really opposed to the idea. I think they think of mental asylums from the 1900s when they hear 'psych ward' rather than like proper therapy. And by asking to go to a psych ward, I feel like I'm overexaggerating or just looking for attention. I want a doctor to like suggest it naturally or something, but the only way I think they would is if I told them how serious I am feeling suicidal at times and I'm really bad at talking about that stuff.

One massive symptom of it is having suicidal ideation and urges as well as suicidal behaviour/attempts and risky behaviours. So for years, day in and day out, I constantly have this nagging thought of killing myself and sometimes just hurt myself. But in the past week or two, this has turned to the worst. I’ve been in and out of hospital lately, but the thing is no matter what my local hospital won’t involuntarily admit me when I still pose a risk to myself… but to be frank I honestly believe that there’s no one can do now, I feel that I’m pass being helped. I’ve tried almost everything, if not all, possible things I can do to help myself including reaching out to services for support.

Suic-672,Advice and plain old love,"To all who come here, I send my love to you. I have been down this road too. Often. When the body is tired and the spirit exhausted, it is hard to continue. But I know know that my depression is a full-body thing. We can all meet plain old sadness head on if we are well. It is a natural part of life. But I have one observation for you from my experiences. I had a realisation after changing medications, that my suicidal ideations were no caused by my sadness or despair. It was the full 6-week wait for my new meds to kick in. (I could not be on the old meds and the new at the same time). It became obvious that no traumas in the world could cause such sudden grief and such black thinking; it was not logical. There was nothing more wrong with me than normal. It was my chemistry, my brain and my body that was telling me to die – not me. I waited for six weeks even though I could not stop planning my death. I survived because I realised those thoughts were not real. The doctor was right, the new meds were a better fit and were worth it. Remember, it is our whole self – muscles, bones, fluids, and neurons that are depressed. Our thoughts are just the triggered illusion of who we are. They are not permanent. I got my body right. My chemicals and muscles eventually succumbed to treatment. Now I enjoy talk therapy and love just plain old talk. Live for others, live for yourself and be patient and kind. Don’t fight your body, give it help. Let the thoughts of killing your body come and go. They are the natural expression of a system that is out of order. Slowly get stronger, don’t expect your thoughts to change on their own. When you are well, you will be able to embrace sadness then let that too pass in time. Believe me, that will be worth waiting for. I am emerging from the tunnel of darkness, and you may too if you see your GP, get the assistance you deserve, then exercise, and let your thoughts come and go as they will. They are not your master.",GTL,Community Member,18-04-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/advice-and-plain-old-love/td-p/24104

I did bring my thoughts up with my closest mates as i wanted one of them to be the support person as suggested on the safety plan, but they then panicked and did not want to leave me alone which i definitely dont want I still think about it daily whether it is just a passing thought, a plan or reminding myself i need to make a will to ensure everything goes to my children. What is the best way to stop making excuses for not starting my exercise, or walking or planning. I want to start, i know i need to, i know i want to but i will always find something else to do. Even just stare at a wall and think of what i need to do even though i have thought or planned it a hundred times before.

Suic-677,"Suicidality, Disability & Apparent Inevitability","Hi, this is my first time here. I am 28, male, white, and have a litany of mental illnesses including complex post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from childhood trauma, agoraphobia that prevents me from leaving the house unassisted, a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and autism spectrum disorder. It feels like every single time I talk to a mental health professional, I leave the zoom call with a new diagnosis. I'm working on collecting the whole DSM. I want to impress upon anybody reading that although I am clearly able to express myself competently through writing, physical social interactions are near to impossible, and I have had some extremely negative experiences in public. The most notable recently was when my previous dog escaped from the house. I was able to catch her, but didn't have a lead, collar, or anything to bring her back to the house. Because this was a disruptive event, I was already overwhelmed, and beginning to experience hallucinations, extreme paranoia, etc. Eventually, I'm sitting on the footpath barefoot in my PJs with my dog in my lap, unable to carry her back to the house. I ask someone walking by if she'd mind sitting with the dog for a minute so I could go around the corner and get what I need. She looked at me and said she wasn't comfortable with it and that ""that's how harm happens."" Which is fair enough, but because of my mental illness, this moment cascaded into a whole event. So there I am, in the street, in unwashed four day old tracksuit pants, I haven't had a haircut in over a year, haven't shaved in almost as long, screaming at this random person about my paranoid thoughts. Let me just say that she did absolutely nothing wrong and if a creepy homeless-looking man asks you to wait alone somewhere or follow him, don't do it. With that said, I've now been in treatment for years, I take the pills, I'm on NDIS and I'm on the DSP, but I'm not improving, and these systems are not enough to survive on without a parent looking after me. It seems inevitable that I'm going to be homeless by 35 - 40, and obviously my disability is profound enough that I won't survive that. I'm unsure what to do.

There's no point to life without pleasure, and it is an unreasonable expectation that I should persist. The only argument is not to cause pain to people who care for you.

Suic-679,I see no point,"Not really sure why im putting this here or if this even goes here, guess i just need to vent or something I should give some context. I recently lost my home due to my landlord wanting to sell cos the market was good, i loved where i lived and i could afford it. i looked after it and took pride in it but once there was an opportunity to make money, all that meant nothing in the end. Because the housing market is so expensive right now, i was forced to move back in with my parents. I don't have anything against my parents, but they live pretty much in the middle of nowhere far from where i was. Now im nowhere near any friends or anywhere i had even a small conection too, also living here and a gay man and a crossdresser, well, its a bad idea. At the same time i lost my home, i had just received a job offer, not anything glamorous but it was something good. I had to give that up since i couldn't find another place to live. I had been searching for decent work and i finally get it only to have it slip away in the blink of an eye. I've had a rough time with mental issues which made it hard for me to be in social settings, i was finally getting past all that, even started making a few new friends and even finding new hobby groups. it felt like for the first time i was finally getting somewhere until i had to move away from it all. I left home at 19 to try and start a life, im 30 now and i'v ended up exactly where i was with nothing to show for it. no skills, no money, no anything.

Now i just sit in my room i barely leave only for food or to shower, there's nowhere to go or any reason for me to leave the house.

Suic-680,Confused about my grief,"My son died 9 weeks ago. He is my middle child and we had a very special bond and I loved him more than life itself. He was a much loved and desperately wanted IVF baby. I’m just not understanding my grieving process. The last 2 days it is like nothing has happened or changed, I just block it all or feel nothing and carry on as normal. I feel so guilty and like I must be a monstrous human being. Have I gone into denial? How can that be possible given my previous overwhelming grief? Tonight I’m back to crying…it’s a roller coaster. His father also suicided when my son was very young-2 and a 1/2. My youngest child (different father who also has significant mental health issues) is currently in a private health clinic for their grief further complicated by their pre existing mental health issues. I think I kept trying to rescue the men I married but just made things worse. The common denominator is me. I think about ending my own life because I am a failure as a mother and a human being. And I miss my son and want to be where he is, or if he isn’t anywhere, then not feeling so useless, hopeless and in pain. But my (now) husband who is completely wonderful has been so supportive and strong I would hurt him immeasurably if I died and I don’t know if my youngest would survive. I always told my son who suicided that when he was depressed or placing himself in dangerous situations to think about me because I would be right there with him, if he died, I would too. It was like a pact. So how do I choose? I’m trapped. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense, nothing makes sense to me at the moment.

Suic-681,Frustrated with myself my thoughts and my past,"Hi Im feeling alone with all these thoughts, they bother me sometimes until it triggers another problem or just messes with me and makes me feel guilty. I guess I was just hoping to get things of my chest and perhaps maybe someone can relate. 2 years ago I was admitted to hospital following an attempt. I was also admitted for the same reason 1 months prior. That period was a horrible time in my life. For about 2 years leading up to this I constantly thought like that - really dark stuff. I didn’t always want to but there were stages when it was constant and relentless. I was in year 7 when I first thought of it. I was constantly worrying about going mad and the fact that it felt like I was loosing my mind. Looking back it was my OCD moving up to a much higher degree than I had previously experienced. I thought that if one of these things that I’m constantly worried about isn’t actually going to hurt anybody or me but still left me feel like this then one day I would probably do something extreme. I am safe, and studying and trying hard to move on with my life. But I know I overthink things and it’s bothering me. I worry a lot about the attempt. I heard people talk about theirs and I’ve read about it, they seem to say that really they didn’t want it. I am so happy to be alive today! But I didn't back then I felt so stupid for not getting it to work properly. I was so depressed afterwards and yet still so anxious. My voice actually seemed to go away the second time. I would speak and no one would hear what I had said. I don’t even know sometimes how many “attempts” I actually have had. As I was so desperate for what seemed like forever. Sometimes now I feel really lucky that I made it and then I think I’m silly for thinking that. Now days songs and things sometimes still get me as they remind me of pain, mental and physical from back then. But that frustrates me as I am the only one to blame for all of that. I hid symptoms, I lied constantly to everyone: I love and my mum was the one who found me. I have caused my family pain and that hurts. At the time everything I did felt like the best option I had available, but I feel I can’t complain.

I think knowledge is power and the more we share knowledge we can use it to help others and to make a difference, a real difference in someone else's healing. I also understand this is a sensitive topic but if you feel comfortable to share what works for you or what you need in that time that stops you from hurting yourself that would be so helpful. Please be mindful this is a sensitive topic so just dot point the things you do instead of hurting yourself. Huge hugs to you all.

Suic-684,Hit rock bottom,"Hey, Ive been experiencing really bad anxiety and depression for the last 5 months or so to the point that I was in hospital on Tuesday and Wednesday and very scared that I would end it all. Going to have blood tests done to see if there are any problems (maybe deficiences or thyroid issues) and am having an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow.

Suic-685,Suicidal thoughts- life can only get better,"The ""absence of logic""? Another way to put it- ""the peak of emotions misplaced"". Community champions here offer peer support based on their experience and knowledge, essentially, in all other ways we are like you. I recall the day my tears filled the nearby creek and the mere thought of losing my full time fatherhood...I muffled grief in my shed. I recall every moment in 1996, one week before her narcissism that forced me to leave. So it's that reflection of my mental state that I'm here talking about it now. There is little logic to it. Emotions are really high and you believe there is no way out- there is though, but your mind isn't in the state to allow you that logic to see clearly. I can say that what really saved me was two things. A few years earlier my father, sensing my wife was twisting my mind, said ""better to be the best part time dad...than no dad at all"" That I had plenty of time to review life on my own, my living arrangements, my interests. With those two assets I left the family home but before I did I kissed my infant girls on their forehead as they slept and took their favourite 'golden book' Saggy baggy elephant with me. For that was the nightly ritual, to read it as they snuggled in bed. Even though, some nights dad took short cuts ""once upon a time...the end, sleep tight"". ""What about Baggy dad""? There is some messages here. If your spouse is a tyrant of any sort remember- tyrants never ""win"" If not a tyrant you just might not be able to live together. It happens That your children deserve you part time or half share. You are important That the grief is temporary That life can be how you plan it, it doesnt have to be all bad memories It's ok to seek help, professionals, even one chat be it on the phone to lifeline 131114 or beyondblue at the bottom of this page in red. A few words can make sense when your own senses are confused I recall it was February that year yet at xmas time I drove into that town to collect my kids for an extended visit. I had to pull over to contain my sadness, my first xmas not at our home. So 10 months later there were those times. But I did what became a routine- I wiped away my sorrow and switched to task mode- to provide a smile on my childrens faces. My focus on them more important Remarried, very happy, I'd built my own home post separation from my ex, kids grown, hobbies, interests and a wonderful life. Please remember- at your lowest point, life can only get better. Life can only get better...

Suic-686,Told my psychiatrist finally,"I heard from my psychiatrist and have finally responded. My email was written over several days and I heavily edited to remove the immaterial. At the end I decided to tell them about tapering and stopping medication. It seems only fair as they have cared enough to write. Now I want to cry and wish I had not said anything. I don't like feeling vulnerable and having been open and honest about my thoughts, feelings and actions upsets me. I do know on an intellectual level that for there to be any hope of a therapeutic relationship when the psychiatrist is back open honesty is essential. On the emotional level I want to cry and run.

My sleep schedule is beyond repair, my bedtime is 6am and all I do is cry when I think about sleeping and then having to wakeup. I have a casual job, it’s not hard 3 times a week really easy stuff not stressful but every time I think about working or having a shift I get a dreaded feeling in my stomach and don’t want to go, I also go to uni 2 times a week but I’ve missed 3 weeks worth of class because I can’t wakeup, can’t get out of bed I have panic attacks thinking about needing to work and go to uni, I feel stupid, when I do go I’m exhausted I’m on the verge of tears all day in class or through my whole shift. All I think about is going home and I’m checking the time every minute wishing the day was over. I did really love what I was learning and I want to continue uni and I have friends there but for some reason it’s just so exhausting. ive been hurting myself, and recently I’ve been daydreaming about everything ending? I don’t want to die. I don't know what to do, I have an amazing boyfriend who supports me but I can’t keep dumping my thoughts onto him, I feel like the only reason I havnt hurt myself really bad is because I have him. Sometimes I think to myself though, how can I can get a valid break from everything? I also don’t have an appetite I think it’s because I sleep all day and when I’m awake I don’t have the energy to make myself food so I just don’t eat, I did have a meal today when my boyfriend was over but other than that not much, and now I have a raging headache. it feels good to type this out, I haven’t been this honest with anyone because I feel guilty and embarrassed …..

Suic-691,Everything is just going in circles,"Hi, I just need to vent for a bit Im in the middle of my uni but everything is going sideways. Im an international student but I failed my course. Im trying to talk to someone in my uni to help me to go back and finish my course but I cant even go out of my house. I kept trying to schedule a meeting but something always happens and i keep canceling my appointment. I failed because for the last semester I wasnt able to do anything. I got scared of going out. Im having a hard time to talk to other people (strangers mostly) face to face. Its more like Im afraid of trying to start up a conversation with them. I dont know why but when Im outside alone I get really anxious/scared. And in my mind i keep talking to myself to keep myself calm. Now because of that, I just keep procrastinating everything. It now led me to failing to extend my passport, fix my visa, fix my uni, fix my life. And i just keep lying to everyone i know. I keep telling them everything is okay, but for real i cant even live properly. Its not like i dont want to fix my life, but everytime I start to think doing something about it, i will feel really anxious and really disturbed that i will not be able to do anything. And it just repeats everyday. Have problem, be bothered by it, be depressed, calms myself, tries to think/fix it, more problems, be anxious again, depressed, calms myself again and so on. Plus i have social, personal, academical, financial, emotional problems and compulsive liar. And then now I got covid which really dampens everything again. Most of the time i think about the s-word and there are times i tried it but never really finished because i know what will happen afterwards. But you know sometimes it feel really pleasing to my mind. Like boom. Done. I feel really pathetic thinking and writing all of this. i just dont know anymore. I just want a way out of everything. Run away from all responsibilities and the rest. Its a life I did not even want and it just seem endless.

Suic-693,Reached out to someone for help - ended up being blocked. Now I feel like some crazy loser :(,"I have gotten into a really bad headspace recently, just getting really worked up about what is going on in the world with the pandemic, WW3 about to break out, Freedom protests etc. I have been having very strong suicidal feelings because it's all too much for me and I'm terrified about the future. I saw some Youtube videos about what the people in charge of this world have planned for us (digital ID, social credit score etc) and I'm really scared. I showed the videos to my family back home to try to warn them and I still get called a conspiracy theorist even though it's the actual World Economic Forum leaders themselves explaining what they are doing. I feel like I cannot get through to my family, and I'm scared about what is in the vaccines. This is a really scary time to be alive. When I get into this weird headspace I find myself crying uncontrollably and feeling a sense of panic. I just want to go back to the 1990s when things were normal. I get really upset when I think about where I would rehome my pets I've also been sexually harassed and bullied at my work amongst other things - there is a lot going on and it's all getting too much. I can't go back to my home country to see my family and they wont come over here to visit me. So I'm here alone and it's not mentally healthy especially during the pandemic. The other night I got to a crisis point and decided that I needed to get help. I have used professional help in the past but I always feel pathetic and I prefer talking to someone that I know. But who could I talk to? I decided that the perfect person for me to talk to was someone I knew that works in mental health. I used to have a crush on this person (which they knew about) and I explained to them that I wasn't trying anything, but was just looking for help. So I told him everything, but it sort of came out as a bit of a ramble because of my neuroses and I think this made them a bit freaked out because the next day they said, in the nicest way possible, that we should go our separate ways. He offered advice on seeking help, diet+exercise etc. I apologized for my ramble and said goodbye. But then later on I sent a reply asking if we could talk at the end of each month, via chat. I said this would help me greatly. Instead of a reply I was instantly blocked. I was devastated, especially as I was in such a fragile mindset. I have been incredibly depressed since and i feel like like a crazy loser.

I don't get to see my new one until March. I am in my 6th week of this year at high school and its really stressing me out. there are all these tests and I'm like trying to pay attention and focus but like nothing sticks in my brain, and especially for science I like remember it but use the wrong words and because I'm doing ATAR than its deemed as wrong. I am doing 5 ATAR subject and a cert in sport and rec, which is my favorite class because there is no stress or worry. I really enjoyed dance in my younger years of school and i wanted to do dance ATAR but the only was I could do it is if i skiped straight to year 12 and like its fun and all but 2 lessons before my contemporary technique class I had a panic attack in the middle of class because it was all so much, and then the next day in the afternoon I was practicing in my room because I missed out on leaning something because I had a panic attack I had another one. my parents don't know about any of this I try and hide it from them, I mean they know that I have anxiety and like they take me to my appointments but I don't tell my mum anything, I actually don't really like talking to my parents at all like I kinda wished they didn't care about me I know it seems silly and like why would I say that but I generally don't feel a connection to them anymore and like I don't need them or want them. Another horrible thing that happened is because the first few weeks of this year where really hard and stressful I relapsed with my self harm again. I was like nearly a year free I'm pretty sure, I'm currently 4h and 37 minutes free. This is my way of coping, but if I don't do it than everything will fall apart again.

Suic-704,"Depressed, feeling like it’s all too much","Hi all, This isn’t easy but I’m giving this a go. I am 45 and have been struggling with alcohol dependency and depression for many years. I went through a horrible separation 5 years ago, it dragged on for years with a psychotic ex and a long struggle with the banks when I had to surrender my house to the bank in order to get out of a mortgage. Somehow I met a lady that had been through similar, she had two lovely young kids, I felt love and hope again and eventually we moved in together and started a life together. We got engaged, had a daughter together (now 2 years old). I loved a drink in the evening, often 5 or 6… for me it was my escape from my troubles, work stress, life’s issues. My drinking was a problem and it was really hard to even have a night or two off. It caused arguments and disagreements with my partner and I often found myself yelling and being super hard on her kids. I was raised that way so I think I parent the way I was. We had our moments but stuck together. In Feb 2021 we bought a house together and this was a massive joy for me as I never thought I’d be in a position again to buy. I worked my ass off at every opportunity to make improvements and build on our investment, to grow our future together. November it all came crashing down and she wanted a break, two weeks later we were sort of back on. By Christmas it had gotten bad again, she wanted a break and space. We are now in seperate bedrooms and under the same roof. I have not been coping with this, the thought of losing the right to see my daughter everyday, not being a part of my step kids lives, losing my house, yet again.. it’s got worse over the last few weeks. She has been spending a bit of time next door with our neighbour, single dad similar age, two similar age kids as well so our kids are always playing with them.. I have been feeling more and more anxious and have started suspecting something. Today a came out and asked, nothing had happened but she said she does have some feelings toward him. I guess it’s a happy change from the current situation here. That moment my heart dropped.. all my hope of trying to get this sorted started to fade.

Suic-705,I'm just curious.,"For the last couple of years, I've been getting impulsive(?) thoughts about me wanting to 'make myself blind' in a sense. I don't have any reason to do this, it's not like I want to be blind or anything similar to that, so I don't why the thought even crosses my mind sometimes. I often times envision what the future would look like if I were to do this, I feel like there's a common thread of me just wanting to seek attention, but those are usually irrelevant(just extremely common with my anxiety and such). What's more important than thinking about the future, is what would happen while I was actually to go through with it. When I think about that, I do in grotesque details; like how it might feel, how it would look, would I regret it, etc. but that doesn't deter me from ever thinking about it again. So I was curious if this is nothing but a strange fixation, or may be a part of a larger problem.",clawbia,Community Member,26-02-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-m-just-curious/td-p/31346
Suic-706,I think I'm addicted,"I've been self-harming semi-on and off since 2018. Over the past year and more specifically the past few months, it hasn't stopped. I still don't know why I do it. Life's just gotten so hard because there's so much pressure for me to do well in year 12. People don't care anymore. Whenever someone notices they'll say something like 'not again' and just roll with it when I laugh it off. Maybe they just don't know what to do. The scariest thing is sometimes I do it even when I don't want to. Like, the other night I was in bed and I just started and I wanted to stop and I couldn't. I can't tell if I'm going to kill myself or not. I can't tell if I want to. I don't care about anything anymore. I use to care so much about the people I would be leaving behind. Now I just can't bring myself to care how they'd feel if I did go through with it. I probably won't. idk. Every single day this week has been depressive episode after anxiety attack after self-hatred. I just don't know how I'm supposed to do this for much longer. I'm not good at school, I can't bring myself to study and every time I try I get distracted or just stop out of nowhere. I'm going to fail everything and it's my own fault because I have no motivation to ever do anything. And everything I do do is wrong and bad. I keep getting conflicting advice. 'your atar won't matter, it's just a number'. 'it's going to get harder and you need to try harder'. 'you don't have to get into a uni'. 'just keep going a piece at a time and get things done'. I'm not good at this, and I can't get better at it. last night I was so tired that I passed out before i could self-harm. I still want to die. idk how to end this.",imtrying_,Community Member,24-02-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-think-i-m-addicted/td-p/23375
Suic-707,Keep wanting to be alone,"Hi, This is the first time posting. Three years ago I tried to take my life due to depression which I tried to ignore since 2010 after my Dad died from cancer. My husband children and family were shocked and angry which was to be expected. It took a long time before my husband felt comfortable enough to go away with his friends and leave me home alone due to not trusting me to tell him truthfully how I am feeling. He has been very supportive and is a Great husband and father. I feel that I don't deserve him or my children . I have this overwhelming urge to pack up and go find a place somewhere away from everyone and everything. I've stopped talking or contacting friends because I always feel I'm the one reaching out or making an effort to see them. I feel people don't really like me. I don't like myself and can't blame them really. I've always struggled with a low self esteem and have tried so hard to like or love me but just lately I've really given up. I'm tired of being disappointed or let down. My husband has a great circle of friends and so do my children. My son and his partner live in the same city but we never see them. My daughter lives 5 hours away with her husband and children and we see them occasionally. What I'm trying to say is that they would all miss me for a little while but things would get better for them and me. In the past I have tried to encourage my husband to find someone else but he always says I'm the only one he wants. I feel like he is the only thing keeping me here stopping me from going away as i dont want to hurt him again like i did 3 years ago. Don't get me wrong I would not try and take my life I just want to go somewhere isolated away from everything.",Neeky,Community Member,24-02-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/keep-wanting-to-be-alone/td-p/531767

I have also told him that I do not mind him looking at other girls and I even point them out to him but the other day we saw two gorgeous young girls and I swear he was drooling and he muttered under his breath nice. I was so upset that I got angry he didnt understand what he had done wrong, and I cried for two days. I now find myself covering up I dont want him to see my ugly body.

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a few years, since I was in about grade 9 and recently things have gotten worse again. I have seen the doctor and increased my medication (it's been a few weeks now) was seeing a counsellor for a couple times before I could get my old psychologist back which I have now had one session and see him again Wednesday. I have been up to the hospital (just the general Hospital) 3 times in the last couple weeks, 2 was because I harmed myself. The harm itself wasn't 'bad' but the thoughts just got too much. It was scary but also good because at least I am safe there. So, I'm getting help and I'm trying to do things to help but the thoughts and feelings are still there. The last two days have been very hard it was a week since I went to hospital and harmed myself, but I did harm myself last night and was not sure whether to go to the hospital because the harm in itself isn't bad- it's my thoughts and I don't feel safe. But I also don't feel safe because of anxiety so I'm really struggling with what to do. Today something happened that really triggered my anxiety and Ive had bad thoughts.

Why have I not gone ahead and just done it???? My house is always a mess, I try my best at work, I try to spend quality time with my two children who I love so dearly. How am I supposed to deal with someone who’s constantly telling me how bad I am at being a parent. Who’s constantly telling me that he’s going to sell all the houses, buy a bus and take the kids. Who constantly tells me that I am the problem in this family. Who constantly tells me that I blame everyone else for my issues. How am I supposed to deal with that? Yes he’s hurting but how is this supposed to make me feel. When I say stop and he doesn’t stop. He pushed me twice today. Never been violent before. The first time he pushed me I accidentally stood on our youngest leg as he was lying on the ground. The second time he pushed me he followed with kicking and another push. I don’t know if it’ll get worse. He says I wind him up?

My whole body feels heavy and most days I struggle to even get out of bed. I find myself crying in the car on the way to work, then crying on the way home again. I am having some really intrusive suicidal thoughts. Though I desperately wish I could just quietly slip out of this life one day. I stop myself because I feel so so guilty to hurt others around me and also my family. I have considered ringing a helpline during some really dark times.

Suic-720,Hard to talk always keep it to myself.,Really don't know how to start I'm probs using this page wrong and telling too much info. My Dr said this a great site to start talking about the things that are hard to talk about. Ever since I was young I always knew I was different but didn't quite understand why couldn't even understand why I wanted to die at the age of 11. At almost 27 now I get flashbacks about suppressed memories and understand things as to why I am the way I am. People always made me think I did everything wrong or that I was a bad person or treated me differently cause I was shy and the fat kid. No one cares about the fat kid. I think that and the bullying made me lose weight as I got older added to my depression and anxiety and helped me develope eating disorders. My father did drugs and was really scary when he drank or got mad but for some reason I was always by his side. I now know I was trauma bonded with him. I loved him no matter how bad things got between us I know he loved and cared for me but at the same time the drugs turnt him into something he wasn't. When he was on drugs he was my pilot dad the lights were on but no one was home. Sober dad was my dad I loved him so much. It pains me to talk about him in this way which makes it hard since I watched him die almost 5 years ago. As I got older he was like my kid. It was us against the world even though when he was on the drugs I had to deal with someone who I couldnt recognise. I've always been the type to self-harm just to feel something other than mental pain. But after my dad passed I couldn't take it. I remembered my family and how I couldn't put them through anymore pain and another loss and also remembered I had loved ones to protect. I already regret talking about some of these things that happened in my life I swear I'm not loopy and no I'm not a danger to anyone but myself.

I suffer from severe depression, anxiety and PTSD. It seems whatever I do is wrong. My life is just one debacle after another. I am a single parent to an 18 year old son. He is very hard work. I have no support from anyone. I do not feel there is anything to look forward to. I lost my beloved dog on January 14 and that has destroyed me. I have spoken to doctors, counsellors, psychologists. What scares me is that nothing makes me feel better. I feel trapped with my son as he does not like his Dad and never goes there. He has me wrapped around his finger. I feel like a slave to him. My life is just one crap day to the next. I wish I could just go away and be with my beloved dog and all my other darlings that I have lost over the years. Life to me is just a nightmare of dramas, tantrums, debacles, arguments... me giving in and spending a lot of money to keep my son happy....my darling dog made life bearable as she was the light of my life. Everyday we would go places and when we were home she was by my side constantly. She is gone and she went through horrible circumstances . I trust next to no one now and I really don't want to be here. I do not need to be sent to a psych ward where I will be treated like a criminal. I need to have some peace and validation. I need my son to not be here. I need to be left alone! But this will never happen!! My son has manipulated everything to his advantage. He is the biggest problem in my life. Yes I am mourning my beautiful girl....I will mourn her forever. But having zero support from anyone and dealing with him and his crap daily ( and nightly...he wakes me up to ask for money for his game?????) is killing me. Yes I love him but I don't want him here right now and there is NO WAY OUT. On top of this my health anxiety has reared it's ugly head. I am convinced I have cancer and the more I worry about it the worse the symptoms get. Then I think 'oh well I hate life anyway so it might be good as then I don't have to kill myself'. My rational mind tells me this is terrible. But the stress, anxiety, grief, drama etc I suffer everyday makes me feel that. Perhaps it is a safety mechanism. Basically my existence is pure misery. I probably do have/will get cancer as I smoke and drink a lot. That is all that is making me get through the days.

A persistent intrusive thought is "" Oh my God what if I really did accidentally hit someone and get charged and go to jail, what would happen to me ?

Suic-727,"I don't want to kill myself, but I want to die.","(For the record I don't intend to kill myself, I don't have any specific plans on that and I am in a safe place) I'm tired. I'm so tired. I've fought so hard, and for so long. My family abused me, so I found friends. That was incredibly difficult to achieve as I was crawling out of a pit of depression. Then after all that, I discovered I was worth nothing to people who meant everything to me. One of my friends tried to hurt someone and did specific things to ruin my life specifically (I found out about both things at the same time. I didn't just draw the line when he turned on me). My 'friends' admitted he was entirely in the wrong, then cut me out of their lives. You'd think I murdered someone. But nope. I'm just me. Apparently being an introvert struggling with depression and loneliness is worse than what they did. Everywhere I go I wonder, will people tolerate me, or will they hate me? I've left two jobs because I was treated like a leper. In one of them - I know it sounds arrogant but it's the truth - I was single handedly keeping the department going but my boss and most people there hated me. Someone refuses to do work for 6 hours? No problem. My desk is untidy? Time to treat me like shit. Because I'm not a likeable person. Doesn't matter what I do. I've settled at my current job because I'm tolerated. They're nice people, and easy to work with. They don't want to be around me though. They always hesitate to invite me to things try to avoid it entirely. And if I'm there, I'm treated like a piece of furniture. No one wants to talk to me. And before people say ""oh you've just got to work on getting better at talking to people and being more charismatic"" or something, I did that. I already did it. And it didn't matter. I've given up on having a partner too. I only even had my first girlfriend at 21. The only girls who are ever interested in me either have low self esteem and feel like they have no choice but to settle on me, or they've had their own mental issues and have learned not to judge. To the rest, I'm weak. I'm a thing. To everyone really. I'm tired. I've had enough. And I'm not religious. I know there's no happy place waiting for me after death. And I still want to die. I just don't want to be in pain anymore. I tried. I fought. I gave it everything I had.

Suic-728,Uncomfortable thoughts,I'm feeling physical pain from my depression. I have this crushing pressure in my chest and the desire to get outside of my own skin to escape it. Suicide is popping into my thoughts a lot and I feel so disconnected and lonely. My mental health had seemed quite good for the last few months but this last week I have taken a bad turn and the thoughts and feelings that are circling around me are uncomfortable and relentless.

Suic-729,What Am I Doing Here??,"I have a deep hate for myself. There isn’t actually anything wrong with me, and I guess that might be a part of the problem. I often wish I could be diagnosed with something that would explain my unhappiness, but I feel too silly for asking to see someone who could help with that. I feel like, deep down, it’s could all just be me seeking attention. I seem to never truly be happy? I have plenty of friends but on some level I feel disconnected to them. They’re nice people and we are all close, but I always catch myself thinking things like if they were to get rid of a member of the group, it would be me. Call them intrusive thoughts if you like; I think I get them often. I hate school, too, even though nothing actually goes wrong there. I know what I should do to feel better. ‘Eat healthy, connect socially, sleep often etc.’ but I don’t want to. Call me selfish, but I don’t want to be okay by myself. I want somebody to notice and do everything for me because I lack the energy to do it on my own. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. Even though I have passions and dreams for the future, it’s all too far away and I’d rather just give up now; I’m just too scared to. The problem is, I shouldn’t have a problem. I look at everyone else’s threads and they all have things that account for their sadness, and I don’t.

Suic-731,Paranoia,I really don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore . So long story short this is my third time typing this because i kept on accidentally deleting it so I’m having these really intense paranoia these past few weeks and i dont know why. I know I’m not some important person but still. So I’m really paranoid about my security and i need to scan my phone with two different antivirus software to make sure that I dont have any malware or spyware on my phone. It’s not like I’m doing dodgy stuff but it’d be nice to be safe. So i was out on a walk today and as i was walking i really didn't pay attention to my surrounding so i didn't see the aircon leaking water. So as i was walking the leaking water from the air condition happened to went into my eye. New fear unlocked! i’m now really paranoid what if they can see what I’m seeing because they have a tracking device in the water? Is it possible? Can you track someone by putting droplets of water into their eyes? As in will you be able to see what they’re seeing? please help me i cant do this anymore Being alive is starting to get really tiring. note: kinda funny how my first thought when the leaking water went into my eye was that and not oh no what if i get an eye infection,H-c,Community Member,10-01-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,20,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/paranoia/td-p/838
Suic-732,Suicidal Thoughts / Control Issues?,"Hi, So I'm not really sure where to start but in a way I'm a control freak I guess (I don't want to control other people) but I feel the need to have control of what happens to me. For example I became rather unwell in late 2020 (Cerebellar Ataxia) I used to be able to walk like normal people now while I have made an improvement I still require the use of a walker to prevent falling over. I'm only 32 so yeah it was pretty scary having my life turned upside down. Since I felt like I had no control I was Suicidal - which is nothing new to me I've tried a number of times of taking my life since I was about 5. I haven't tried for maybe 6 years now but I've often had thoughts when I feel like I have no control. I'm pretty self aware I know it isn't 'normal' which is why I tell people I have these thoughts and people have thought I do it to black mail them - which isn't the case. I do it because I feel helpless and backed into a corner and it makes me want to regain control. I've worked with a number of people about changing my ways but while I made improvements it's something that will take time to make changes I could write a few pages on why and what I feel but that's my issue I got to deal with not others... a bit side tracked sorry. The issue tonight is Centrelink in all their wise choices are saying I must look for work (I'm on DSP) or I'll lose my payments - I'm not someone that just wants to collect money and do nothing with my life - I'd much rather work then not work but due to my health and treatments that I'm undergoing I can't. I'm going to get my lovely wife to call centre link tomorrow and see if that can be changed... but at the end of the day I'd rather suicide then be forced into something that I'm not ready for.. Yes extreme and it's not something I want but at least I have some control and not forced into something I'm unable to do.

Suic-737,Hi Everyone,"Hello, and thank you for accepting me into this community. I have been experiencing low mood and passive suicidal thoughts for the past 4 years. They have varied in consistency and intensity over the period. Generally, when I am experiencing more stress and helplessness at work they get worse, and when I am able to complete my work efficiently and effectively it gets better, though even during those times I experience feelings of lethargy and wish that I could go to sleep forever and be at peace. Right now things are getting worse again and I find that I am dragging myself out of bed each morning, waking up only after an ever increasing amount of coffee, which is my little bit of enjoyment during these cold winter days. I then try to go for a short walk or jog before I start work as its another activity I enjoy. After work, I feel a sense of relief as the day is finally over and after eating dinner, I rest in bed feeling fatigued and hoping this endless cycle would just - end. Objectively speaking, I have a good job and great colleagues. My current role involves analysing current businesses processes in order to implement a new accounting system for the company. It is a great chance to learn a lot about the business and its processes, meet people as well as the opportunity to become a subject matter expert on the new system which will be used for many years to come. Other aspects of my life are good too, I might even say perfect. I have loving parents, who are still alive and care about me. I talk to them at least once a week and they message me daily with little bits of encouragement. I have been in a stable long term relationship for the past 9 years, and my girlfriend has stuck by me. We talk daily, though its more me listening to her as I am quite disengaged with life and dont have much to say, other than the fact that I am depressed, feel trapped but cant understand why. I dont have any children or other commitments in life. I do not experience any financial stress as I have a job and given my disengagement and disinterest with life, rarely feel anything is worth spending money on. I take pleasure in the small things in life, hot coffee on cold mornings, gentle winter sunshine on my skin, fresh air, long walks, clear blue skies. I dont drink or smoke. I am going to see my GP again to request professional help and am hoping that with some expert advice and medication, it will all work out. Thank you for reading and wish everyone a good day.",charliedog,Community Member,03-07-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,6,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/hi-everyone/td-p/6709
Suic-738,Seeing no future,"Lost my full time job over six months ago, it’s taken me this long to finally realize that. Now the anxiety attacks have started. I’ve suffered from depression followed by panic attacks since childhood. I remember my first panic attack. I was 9 at the time and I still recall trying to kill myself, but even that lead to a worsening of the panic attack. Since then I have had periods of anxiety attacks over the years, which lead to depression at the age of 3, now I’m 55 and had depression ever since. At this present time I have been suffering from anxiety for 2 weeks, it has totally disabled me. The attacks started when I started working for a new employer, who systematically tried to rip me off, none of the conditions promised were delivered, no tools, no service car, no mobile phone and the laptop they gave me to do the on-site programming was broken. Yet they still expected me to do the service work. It really came to a head when at the end of the day the last job they sent me to hadn’t been confirmed with the client, the client wasn’t there, so my boss said to go home half an hour early. The next day I was informed that I now owned my employer an hour, I said how did that happened as I didn’t want to go early, you instructed me to, he said that doesn’t matter, it’s how they do things there. I then realized the type of company I signed up with. I left 2 days after that when the anxiety attacks started and I couldn’t concentrate on my work. Now the anxiety has gotten out of control and just the thought of applying for another job is making it worse. I don’t know what to do, I see no future, even the thought of ending my life leads to furthering my anxiety because I’m scared of how my wife and son would be affected by it.

My Uncle is accusing me of fraud, he is spreading lies about me, claiming I stole upwards of $10,000.00 off of my OWN GRANDMOTHER! I would NEVER do such a thing, myself and my Nan have an extremely close relationship, a close bond. My Nan loaned me $5,000.00 (which I have paid back) however for some unknown reason my Uncle is claiming I’m a criminal, that I’ve committed fraud and so on.

I’ve lost everything, he called my place of work and trash talked me, causing me to lose my job. He’s spreading lies about me within the family ect. He has ruined my life, I don’t know what to do, or where to go from here, I no longer have anything to live for. I’ve never been so depressed, anxious, angry and suicidal like this before!

My Uncle and Aunt clearly hate me, so maybe more of my family members do as well, I don’t know why. My uncle has made all this, personal, I don’t know what I’ve done to him for him to be this way with me, as we were close, can he not stand the fact that I was succeeding in life?

We are old school and our upbrining is the balkan way. I am not one who is very out spoken and I dont argue cause I dont know how to, I dont stick up for myself which has to do with my father always telling me that i was stupid and he even told me that I wasnt beautiful at the age of 18, he was trying to convince me to marry an import (25) as I will never find anyone. Anyway that all happened and then he hit me and I threw him out, (but he handled me and i said No but he never accepted No....so fast forward I am 51& I have been married for a long time but during my first pregnancy I think I left hubby like 6 times and over the years I have left many times but always have come back.

I don’t trust myself or my own thoughts, and I feel like a hypochondriac or attention seeking drama queen. I think I’m making things up, or dramatizing it. I emailed and said as much last night. That I’m a bad person and I don’t deserve help. Its just that things aren’t clear or keep changing in my mind, and it was all so long ago - I never said anything, I excelled in so many areas, I was fine for so long, it just doesn’t make sense. now I’m in this spiral of what a horrible human being I am for acting like a victim and I just want to disappear.",Annewithan-e,Community Member,09-01-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,17,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/feeling-like-a-terrible-person/td-p/34497

Suic-751,Interactions with health professionals,"I've recently had some negative interactions with health professionals, mostly in the emergency department of the hospital, related to my mental health and specifically around SH. These have left me feeling quite traumatised. I am doing better now as I have spoken to my psychologist about these experiences but I am wondering if anyone else has had these experiences? It was quite upsetting because it took a lot of courage to seek help when I needed it and to be that vulnerable and then made to feel like a waste of time and space was hard.",Gem17,Community Member,11-12-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,23,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/interactions-with-health-professionals/td-p/5661
Suic-752,School holidays and feel so depressed having no mum friends,"Hi everyone, im finding these school holidays so isolating and lonely. Not sure if it’s because we have spent most of the last 2 years in lockdown and this adds to it or not. I’ve got 2 autistic children and looks like my 1 year old also has autism so we can’t leave the house so easily. We have no backyard as we moved into our new build house, so we are essentially stuck inside 4 walls all day everyday. My husband works long hours, or works away or nightshift with his own business. It makes for some super long days just watching the clock. It’s not so simple as going for a walk or a bike ride or a playground as we need both parents here to help. my father passed away from a cancer battle almost a year ago and my dog also passed around the same time. These deaths along with the birth of my daughter all around the same time made me realise I essentially have no friends. No one really cares. I totally understand, we can’t attend birthday parties, we try and usually have to leave early as the anxiety is too much for the kids, can’t do play dates with lots of kids even play dates in our home is hard. I can’t ever catch up with just the mums for a kid free night as my husband is always working. so I totally get and can understand why I can never make proper friendships. But jeez it’s lonely. it’s school holidays once again and here we are with not a single play date request for either child. Look I get why but I’m also so sad for them. They are so beautiful and wish they had friends that understood them and wish I did too. I’m literally going bat shit crazy sitting inside 4 walls all day long. Think I’m suicidal, I’d never do anything coz if I did there would be no one to look after my kids, I also can’t get help at an inpatient facility as again no one to help. My mum lives in the same suburb but I can tell her I feel this way as she would message everyone in her phone to tell and I can’t ask her for help with the kids as she whinges that they will mess up her house or she is exhausted or she loves to give me a play by play of autistic behaviours she has observed. I just feel so exhausted and depleted. I feel so lonely and like I don’t fit in anywhere. I’m also trying to find a new school for our kids as the current one is not suitable and we feel maybe a complete new move would be best and start fresh down the beach somewhere. It’s just all a bit much right now and I feel so lonely and so depressed. not even sure any of this made sense.",Candy84,Community Member,04-01-2022,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/school-holidays-and-feel-so-depressed-having-no-mum-friends/td-p/33570
Suic-753,Suicidal and Anxious,"So, I’m 20 years old and dealing with some sort of eating disorder, every time I put food in my mouth, I feel sick. I’m not trying to lose weight but now I’m extremely underweight, the doctor’s say its psychological maybe ARFID. I tried to see a hypnotherapist, but they cancelled my appointment that I had been waiting months for. I’m also failing University and in massive debt with no income, I study all the time, but I still fail the subjects I can’t tell my parents about it. I’m supposed to be a genius I got A’s in school, but I got 20% on my last exam even though I answered all the questions. I suffer from anxiety and get panic attacks all the time in public, I try breathing slowly but it never works. I’ve never had a girlfriend in my life and I’m 20. For these 5 reasons (eating disorder, failing uni, broke, panic attacks and loneliness) I get suicidal thoughts every day. When I’m trying to go to sleep, I spend 30 minutes thinking about suicide. I’m agnostic but I hope there’s an afterlife because I won’t be around much longer at this rate.

HUGE TRIGGER WARNING!! Please stay safe. I’m 15 years old, and I’ve had depression for 3 years. I got diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety when I was 12. I started doing self-harm then too. I feel like I’m slipping away. Like I’m drowning in an ocean full of my own tears. I’m just watching my mom trying to fix her broken child. Watching her spend all this money on this broken porcelain doll. Trying to glue up every little piece. I’ve been to every counsellor. Every doctor. I’ve told them about the voices in my head. About the tendencies. Every time I walk past an object that I could use, I start breaking down. I cry over tiny, little things. I’ve changed my anti-depressant medication 3 times. It even made me put on 30 kg. I’ve tried everything, and I just feel like nothing is working. It’s like I’m running out of time. I’m running in a pointless circle. But my legs are broken. I look into the mirror, but I don’t recognise myself. I just see a broken porcelain doll. That my poor mom is trying her hardest to fix. Those tiny little pieces scattered all across the floor. She’s picking them up and gluing them together. Watching her break. I’m really stuck here, I don’t know what to do. I’m scared. Then again, I’m sorry about this post.

Suic-756,Therapist dependency - Am I a bad client?,"My therapist made it clear we have issues with our professional relationship. I came out from my first trip in a mental health ward and had a support worker who visited me twice every week and was there for me between these meet-ups. From then, I was transferred to a community mental health team and assigned a therapist who only saw me once a week. I used to have breakdowns mid-week, and would attempt to call or email her and ask for calls for support. Most sessions, I was unable to speak truthfully due to anxiety, and would send clarifying messages after. Overtime, she began to say my calls were not helpful, and overall gave off a vibe that I shouldn't call her. She was always busy, so I was very anxious to call. Eventually, she said no to all texts and emails based around therapy, which had become my only way to communicate truthfully to her. I tried to suggest other options, like maybe some kind of personal chat room for our sessions (which were almost always calls during COVID times) but she said it wasn't allowed in any text format. She said it wasn't ""therapeutic"" and was crossing boundaries, even when it was me trying my hardest to be a helpful client. I know I am dependent on her, and she said so too. I brought up the possibility of dependent personality disorder, but she didn't really...focus or continue that conversation. (Not diagnosed with it). She never really helped me understand my dependency, or work through why it was there, or come up with alternatives or anything. Is it my fault? Was I acting out of turn and being a bad client? Cause that's how I felt every time she told me my emails were out of line and ignored my texts trying to explain. Should she have focused more on trying to help me cope with these dependent emotions? I feel like she sort of just...cut me off. And maybe that's the only way, but it didn't help me to get over it at all. This experience happened earlier this year, and since then I have only become more meek around her. I never say no or assert myself, I blame myself for everything the time. I never want to bother her, seeing her makes me want to cry. I feel so angry that this was allowed to go for so long, but I hate myself for feeling anything negative toward her. The whole thing has given me a LOT of self-loathing. We tried a new psychologist, and I immediately had the same problems. Are there therapists who can help me deal with this specifically?

Suic-757,I hate everything,"I’m 26, depression diagnosis at 18. I got worse after taking medication, and better after stopping, so go figure. It’s been 7 years since I was medicated, and I’ve had some good times since then. But it fell apart lately. I was living in the city and while I wasn’t enjoying it, I had some people around me. But I lost them. I loved someone; I watched them love someone else. So I did all those things you’re supposed to do. I got fit, I picked up some hobbies. I even moved to a small town, because I felt like I’d be happier in nature. But all I’ve done is made myself miserable, and fit, and busy, and living in nature. I can’t enjoy any of this. We just had Christmas, and I’m on a low income, so I spent all this money and it still felt not good enough. Then I got all these presents I don’t want, because I live in a small bedroom in a share house with nowhere to put anything. Then I feel bad for not appreciating what people got me. Then I feel exhausted for having to hide all those feelings and pretend I’m fine. I feel angry that I’m on a low income when I have a bachelors degree, that the housing market is screwed up for any single person my age, so I have to sit in this tiny room with all the things people keep getting me that I don’t want. I feel lonely in this town, where I have no friends, and I miss the people I lost, and I can’t really talk to anyone at all. My job is supposed to be about helping people, so I can’t just break down. But I feel like I’ve got no one at all. Nobody knows I’m feeling like this, because there’s no one I can trust with these feelings. I don’t have a plan or anything. I’m not in danger. Life just feels so very burdensome. When I was younger I could hope for something different. But now, I feel like it doesn’t get better from here. I’ve had my heart too broken to trust. Everyone is settled into their own worlds and own relationships that don’t include me. Everything is so tasteless and colourless and flavourless that even if I had a nice life, I just can’t bring myself to enjoy anything anymore. I’m so tired of having to support myself all alone in a world that sees me as another sponge to squeeze work and money out of. I’m so tired of the effort that has to go into existing, without even a best friend or SO to feel safe with and make it feel worth it. I’m just living for me, and I don’t like living.

Suic-758,Excluded. TW: Suicidal Ideation and Self-Harming.,"I am often excluded. I opened up to one of my netball teams in particular about the fact that I experience anxiety, only to be ignored and kicked off of the team. This isn't the first time a netball team have kicked me off of their team and attempted to bully me out of my passion. What disgusted me the most about this netball team in particular is that another chick I previously played with openly admitted to me that she suffered from anxiety and yet she still gets to play. Disgusting. My mother wants to exclude me from going out as a family with my father to have lunch with him. Going out for lunch seldom occurs nowadays as they consider the playing on the poker machines more important than their own daughter's hungry stomach. I pay board every fortnight and mum claimed that it goes towards the important things like paying the bills, when in reality she blows it on whatever she damn well wants to blow it on. She also blames me for everything, like when her and my father fight when he has been drinking. Whenever I try to involve myself in family conversation between her and my dad, she doesn't want my input, and basically tells me to shut up, or, as you already know, excludes me deliberately. I know that my father is suicidal like myself and my mother told me flat out that if he does anything to himself, she will blame me. I was also bullied out of my role as a volunteer working with animals (cats). Again, I was passionate about this. I stood up to a bully who told me I was an irresponsible pet owner, as well as being bullied by someone who was part of their cult who used very abusive and sexist language towards me. This was 100% uncalled for as I had done NOTHING wrong. I was also threatened with security. Growing up, I had to watch my mother suffer from severe anxiety. She was couch/bed ridden. This was all due to the fact that she was raped by her father for most of her life, and bullied at school. I did NOT deserve to live through all her problems. I also have never been good enough for another family member of mine. When I spoke with her openly about the fact that my own grandmother, her mother, threatened to get a Maori woman to assault me to oblivion. I feel like I don't have a purpose in life. I think about suicide often, but I am too scared to act upon it, so I resort to self harming.",nib,Community Member,31-10-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,6,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/excluded-tw-suicidal-ideation-and-self-harming/td-p/11290
Suic-759,My complex trauma and the ongoing pandemic,"I just feel like having virtual rant here, as I don't feel safe saying it anyone in real life.. It's only been in the last couple of years that the source of most of my anxiety has been traced to complex trauma that has been slowly compounding most of my life. I'm feeling in constant conflict about this, as I'm so in protection mode now, I have trouble with empathising for others, and I've always looked out for others in the past, so I feel so guilty and self absorbed and my values are really being hurt being this way. Earlier this year I had a bad experience with the health system, after already feeling traumatised by past experiences. I then had a close call with suicidal thoughts and how I was treated by the health system was the trigger. Over the last few months things have been building up again, as I have chronic health issues which need attention, but I just don't trust anyone in the system anymore who is supposed to support me in a ""gentle"" way. I live on my own in a regional area and don't see real people very often. The lockdowns have just about destroyed me, but even worse, part of my past trauma means I just can't wear a mask. I have feinted 8 times this year alone from mask wearing in public, to have the ambulance turn up. I have injured myself several times when hitting the deck, and just can't keep doing this. I did get a letter of sorts from the GP, and I wear a badge when I'm out now, but the social stigma, from the emotional policing of other people has me avoiding going out unless I need a bit of food. I haven't actually worn a mask for a couple of months, but felt compelled to, when visiting the GP clinic a week ago, which ended in collapse and injury. I get extremely distressed when I read of the ongoing dialog around mask wearing, and how it's a small price to pay, and the prospect of it never ending. I even almost have a panic attack when I see someone else with particularly restrictive face covering on. I'm now even more worried, as the new variant making the situation worse, and my double vax losing effectiveness. I'm also moderately immunocompromised and suffer light asthma, but I can't get an appointment for a booster around here until February. So I'm doubly worried as my efficacy time has already run out and I fear I may be at greater risk for that reason.....and because I can't wear a mask. I'm back in the mood of suicidal thoughts, and I wouldn't admit this to the local health services, as the way I've been neglected in the past means I feel safer staying away from them, and feel safer in the knowledge that I'm free to take my life if I finally decide I've had enough.",DeltaJ,Community Member,19-12-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,7,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/my-complex-trauma-and-the-ongoing-pandemic/td-p/10106
Suic-760,"Suicide & my murdering narcissistic  ""mother"".","My beautiful older sister committed suicide a year ago on December 27th. She sent our ""mother"" a skype message advising her of her intentions which was ignored until 2 days later when ""mother"" mentioned to my younger sister & jokingly said that ""Amy"" was on ""her suicide mission again"", my younger sister rang ""Amy"" immediately but there was no response as she was already gone. All of us sisters have attempted suicide many times due to the lifetime of mental abuse from ""mother"". I ceased contact with her in 2014 when she rang me to tell me she was happy that my beloved father had finally succumbed to cancer, she HATED him (they divorced when I was a teenager & I stayed with him which she has always resented me for) This narcissistic self centred ""woman"" posts on her facebook page how much she misses her elder daughter for sympathy only. She hated ""Amy"" as much as she hated me. (I am NOT a friend of hers of course, her fb profile is public so she garners as much sympathy as possible from strangers) I self harm to cope & when ""mother"" saw my scars the last time she saw me in 2014 she told me they were disgusting and I should wear long sleeves to cover them up. I call them my survival scars. When I drink alcohol and cut, I of course cut deeper to see if I could actually succeed but I have my little fur baby that I love and would never leave behind. Right this moment (Christmas), I am sad, lonely, desperate & am caring for my little fur baby who endured surgery yesterday which she is thankfully recovering from. If she had died, I would be dead right now. My other gorgeous fur baby was sadly put to sleep a year ago yesterday, at age 16 due to illness so that is another thing to deal with along with my sisters suicide. I contemplate suicide everyday. I would have my little fur baby put to sleep first as I would never leave her behind. Life is not worth living. At this time of the year it is worse.

Suic-767,Content with life.,"Does anyone else ever feel like their life has peaked already? I am in my late 30s. I have some amazing memories of stuff I have done. So many dreams I had of things I wanted to do with my life, I have crossed them off. Things that I can never better. I bought a house, sold it, bought a car, paid it off in half the time of the loan. I lived to travel. I would work hard, save up, go travel. Come back broke and start again. Always planning the next one. Covid has changed me, no travel, my long distance relationship ended with the girl I was madly in love with. Couldn't see her for 16 months and I was already struggling with that. Before I was always so happy in life and never had bad days. I never understood about mental health issues because I thought life was amazing. And more-so when I came back from overseas when I first got together with my girlfriend. I got lots of comments from people about how happy I was. Slowly it ground away at me and now it's rare I have a happy day. Just go to work, get paid. Get tired, go home and sleep... I put that fake persona on for work pretending I am always in a great mood to serve customers.... All For what? I'm not taking the vaccine, too many reactions and people getting sick from it... which aren't being reported, only ""it's good take it everyone go get it"" I don't trust the government and the forcing of people to take it to keep jobs etc. It isn't tested enough for me. If everyone getting it is still alive in 1 or 2 years then I might consider it.... But I don't know if I want to stick around that long. I'm currently on a medical exemption of 6 months. So I can work and travel for 6 months. I am saving money. After it ends I probably can't work, can't travel so won't have much left. Will have to go back to my parents house and just be a burdon on them because I can't work and have my own place. And don't really want to because they were against the vaccine too but then suddenly changed and went and got it like they were brainwashed into it. Now are trying to tell me to get it so it want be a comfortable place to live anyway I have done so many great things and don't really have any further plans for my life than maybe get married. But that also isn't seeming likely. I am starting to feel like it might be better to just end it on my terms instead of getting old and slowly falling apart. I am happy with my past and I am content with my life. Still 6 months to try and do a few more things! After that who knows",Ryan2021,Community Member,06-12-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,6,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/content-with-life/td-p/416
Suic-768,Would you bother living if you were like me?,"-Extremely ugly, I have never had a relationship, i have been called ugly multiple times and girls have said 'ew' to me. I'm genetically inferior, I have low testosterone, a big forehead, rounded face, inability to grow facial hair or muscle no matter how well I work out, skinny and feminine, all traits which are unattractive for women. -Low intelligence, probably the lowest scoring in some of my classes, I'm ashamed to even show up to school every day because of how stupid I am, It's embarrassing to have people laugh at you because of how stupid you are, and yet you have to play along to not be made fun of for being sensitive. This may only be two reasons, but tens of reasons spur from each, with a few dictated previously. With these two problems, I will never be successful in life, and will never be loved by anyone. I'm forever chasing a career made for people twice my IQ. I can't take being rejected anymore, it's humiliating and makes me truly realise how disgusting I am, and how ashamed of myself I should be. I want someone in this world to appreciate me for who I am, but every girl is always too good for me. They always go for men that are better than me in every perceivable way. I don't blame them, I would do it too if were them. It just hurts so bad - worse than any physical pain - when I see a woman I love with another man, while being disgusted by me. I would be ashamed and embarrassed to be seen in public with me as a partner. I just wish I wasn't a disgusting sub-human. I wish i was good looking and smart enough to be successful and loved by someone. The thought of someone appreciating me or even holding my hand makes me so excited until I realise it will never happen. What is the point of a life without success and love? I'm sick of punishing and torturing myself because I deserve it. I'm sick of crying myself to sleep. I'm sick of seeing the disgusting thing I have to call my body in the mirror. I wish assisted suicide was given to people with lives not living. I'm too afraid to kill myself. Every time I tried I woke back up or was too scared to do it. No amount of anti-depressants can make me smart and good looking, which is why I will never take them again. They do nothing. I can't be fixed. I have to choose between living a meaningless existence as an ugly, stupid sorry-excuse of a human being, if you can even call me that. Is suicide the answer in my case when I already know my future won't get better due to things I can't change?",personunknown,Community Member,03-11-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/would-you-bother-living-if-you-were-like-me/td-p/15568
Suic-769,'Attention Seeker',"Hi, this feels weird. I wanted to share this somewhere, but figured that sharing it online, on a platform like Instagram where people are less likely to understand, and people know who I am is a bad idea. This year hasn't been great for me. In fact, this year has been bad, for a number of reasons. In a course of about 9 months I have attempted suicide, self-harmed, had my parents lose all trust in me, went from a friend-group of 14 to 0, been diagnosed with severe depression, severe anxiety and a mild stress disorder, and have had to leave school due to an extreme amount of bullying. I really wish I could fit the whole story in, but there's A LOT. Some of this might not make sense due to lack of backstory, but I get the main point across so it's okay. An 'Attention Seeker' is a name I've become quite used to being called in these last 9 months. My best friend at the time, who I opened up to after my suicide attempt was the person who started this. She could not understand why she wasn't allowed to tell anyone about it, yet I was. The fact that I told my mum to take me to hospital after an overdose of pills because I suddenly regretted what I had done was enough for her to say that it was an attention thing. I had realised after an hour and a half that I didn't want to die. I just wanted to escape the pain. It destroyed me. I felt physically sick hearing that from my 'best friend'. It was mentioned to me at school one day, and when I went to speak to the school psych, she asked me if I had actually attempted for attention. Is this really the help I get? This person spread around to everyone that I had attempted suicide for attention. Not long after this, one girl made my life a living hell. She made up rumors. She told everyone that I faked mental issues. When I reported her to the head of upper school, he said he didn't understand why I was upset. Boys in my class asked me if I was an attention seeker. Even people like one of my mum's friend called me an attention seeker. EVERYONE called me an attention seeker. It's sickening. But, I know I'm not an attention seeker. I have heard it so much that even if I started to believe it at one point. But I'm not. Only I know how I'm feeling, and the reason I act the way I do. I've tried getting my point across to these people, but it has been pointless. And just like me, you're not an attention seeker because of what you're going through. Please don't believe it. Only YOU truly know how you're feeling.",happyteacup05,Community Member,05-12-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,12,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/attention-seeker/td-p/359

I’m 26 and should be enjoying my life with my partner, friends and family. For the last 3 months all I have wanted to do is stay away from everyone, put on a brave face at work and pretend like nothing is wrong.

Suic-771,Feeling Down and Alone,"Hello, Lately I have been feeling so alone and like I am wondering through life by myself. It makes me feel as if I could disappear and nobody would notice or care that much, which is when I start to think negative thoughts. I know it isn’t the answer but my mind always goes there and it is so hard to pick myself back up again once I am down the rabbit hole. I was in a very toxic relationship, which ended a few years ago, but I lost all my friends during the process. I have a hard time making friends so I don’t currently have any that I can turn to. My husband tries to help, but he doesn’t understand and eventually just gets frustrated with me. My sister is having her first baby and that is all my family care about . Nothing else matters but the baby, and I’m so happy for her, but I feel like she is leaving me behind and moving on with her own seperate family. It is so hard dealing with something like this and not having a support system. I feel selfish asking for help as my family have their own lives.

""It's getting harder to hide All the feelings I've built up inside. It's hard to explain Without being considered insane, So I've kept to myself. Even the weekends seem to be a chore.

Now it's a struggle just to hold on. To make it through the day, Without an odd look my way Or someone asking me if I'm okay. But maybe it will do me good To let someone help if they could.

Suic-773,life seems to get harder,"hello, this is my first post here so i'm sorry if this is disorganised, i just need to vent i don't have many people to talk to; i talk to my school friends almost never whenever we're not in school. i feel constantly lonely in school and have been many times left behind by them, most of the time where they talk to their other friends without acknowledging me or walk off without me. i only have one online friend who i talk to on a personal level and regularly, my boyfriend. i do my best to talk to my irl friends to be closer with them, but i feel like it never works - i always try to be there for them when no one else is, but as soon as they're alright, i feel like i'm immediately discarded and they go be with their other friends again. no one knows how i feel, and i don't want to open up about it since it'd be awkward since i'm really not close with my friends. only my boyfriend knows, but when i opened up to him and told him i think my friends hate me and why, he kept telling me they don't, but eventually snapped that my friends must hate me then. i haven't told him anything since. i don't think i want to be with him anymore, but his mental health isn't in a good place either, so i'm worried i might set something off if i do that (i don't think he'd be threatening to me or anything, but he'd get upset). i dont want to tell my parents; i dont want them to feel like theyre bad parents (which my mum told me before when she saw me crying). my dad is helpful, but i don't want my mum feeling left out, but i don't opening up to her cause she doesnt get it (she tells me to just be happy, and that my friends like me). earlier she walked in on me crying again and when i refused to talk to her about it, she said she was now going to feel bad for the rest of the night and 'thanks'. my family fights a lot, making it worse since my autism&anxiety worsens with noise. i cant tell my dad rn since he will be gone for a while, and i cant call him as to not stress him out more working. even when im not crying, my anxiety makes me feel like i am going to die. i've been feeling suicidal, and have hurt myself, but don't want to tell anyone cause of that. i can't tell my therapist (who i havent seen in a while, and since i just met her i feel hesitant on opening up) cause then she'd have to tell my parents. i also feel incredibly ugly and insecure. i feel hopeless, and i want to get better, ive been trying and nothing seems to be working there's more, but character limit",jup1ter,Community Member,14-11-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/life-seems-to-get-harder/td-p/7309

Suic-776,in the middle of an argument with friends,"i’ve never really posted on anything like this before so here goes nothing. basically all year i’ve been in this friendship group of four girls. within the group, i am best friends with this one girl, we’ll call her stacy. and im very close with the two other girls in the group as well, we’ll call them amy and emma. all year stacy has felt really excluded from our group, because she felt as though i was closer to amy and emma than she was. because of this, she’s felt really insecure with herself and therefore been really possessive of me and would always get angry with me if i would take photos with them/ message them which would always make me upset but i wouldn’t say anything because i’m too scared to upset stacy. i’ve managed to juggle all this all year just fine, but just recently amy and stacy had a massive argument that started over something very small and escalated into them calling eachother names and saying they have always hated eachother and now my friend group has fallen apart and it’s really upsetting for me because i like all of them and want to be friends with them all. and now stacy is not letting me talk to amy or emma because stacy feels attacked by them and feels that it i were friends with them it’s like an act of betrayal. but the thing is i really really love amy and emma they’re really good friends of mine and the idea that i could lose them forever is making me so anxious and sick. but if i stay friends with them, i’m going to lose stacy. this situation i have found myself in it’s just too much for me, i feel like it’s a lose lose situation. i’ve been feeling sick to my stomach all day thinking to the point where i can’t eat and i’m constantly on the verge of tears, i jsut don’t know what to do. i realise the obvious solution is to just tell stacy that i still like and want to be friends with amy and emma, but i have mentioned it that verify yesterday and she got really upset with me saying that i shouldn’t even want to be friends with them considering how they made stacy feel, and if i’m stacy’s best friend i should always stick up for her. the other thing is i’m really afraid to upset stacy because she’s told me before that she’s tried to commit suicide and i’m scared to do or say anything that’ll contribute to that feeling she has. i just am so lost in what to do and i feel so sick thinking about it, i just wish everyone could be friends with everyone and no one would ever fight.",izzy12345,Community Member,28-11-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/in-the-middle-of-an-argument-with-friends/td-p/33787

Suic-779,Back Again,"Hi guys, just want to say hi again. I'm back again. I think it was around the time I had my birthday and I turned 35. Anyways, nothing's changed as I said. I am still as hopeless as ever. Here's a few things about me. I am still jobless, unable to get a job anywhere (due to longterm unemployment), unable to work due to my mental condition and don't know what to do with my life. I still live at home. I am still single, unwanted and childless (I dont think that will change, sadly). I am still socially isolated, with no friends. All my friends are gone from my life. I am STILL suffering from depression and anxiety, been unable to work, still. I am still on medication. I was cut off from Centrelink because I went through a really depressed period this winter where I couldn't get out of bed and I couldn't function at all. And this Spring has felt like a continuation of winter. I have NO social life. Basically, Centrelink referred me to a Disability Employment Services. However, I went through a really low patch where I was feeling really crappy. Both about myself and my life. I didn't get out of bed. I couldn't even do the one thing that's been helping my mental health and that's gardening because the weather has been nearly constantly terrible. I stopped answering my phone, they were trying to contact me by mail, but I had no motivation to do anything. My depression has been really bad. I have no purpose in my life. I have never been married, never even been in a real relationship before. No one has ever wanted me. My friends have all abandoned me years ago before things even turned to crap in my life. I was going to the gym. But I stopped that too. When the lockdown hit, I didn't go there for 2 weeks. Then we had to wear masks there. I went after that. But then I lost all my motivation to go anymore. I started going only once a week, then it was once every 2 weeks, now I haven't been for nearly a month. All I do these days is lay in bed. I feel like I've lost in this life. I don't even know how I ended up so alone. I have no one to talk to each day. I have no one to hang out with. I am so painfully lonely and isolated. I am in an online relationship but all she does is abuse me. I tried online dating sites, but nobody is ever interested in me and I never found anyone I liked.

She new so much about home and I wish she knew she could have told me. Maybe she would still be here. She was going to go beauty school and she was going to dye my hair. I keep thinking that she will turn up to our classes. she was one of the first people I came out to and she never got to come out to everyone else. She knew about what was happening in my life and she told me about her past issues. She was such a sweet person. And I hate saying that she “was”. I hate it. She should still be that nice person who made everyone so happy. She should get to leave school and move to a bigger city like she wanted to. She should have gone to semi formal and had Christmas. I wish she knew that we loved her. I wish she talked to me or anyone. I love her and I don’t want to admit she’s gone. It’s not fair. She didn’t deserve to feel like this. And as someone who has been thinking about ending it for ages I wish she had told me I couod have tried to help her. I love you Ashley I hope your ok now.

Suic-785,Starting over,"Hi all,this is my first time posting. I've been looking through some of the threads and have found some comfort in knowing I'm not the lone ranger. I'm 57 but feeling 87 right now, a few weeks ago I tried and obviously failed to end my life. I've spent 2 weeks in a psychiatric unit and been home a week. It's all been a long time coming as I've had depression for many years. I couldn't find a way to stay before but now I realise it is down to me to keep going and maybe one day I'll find that reason. I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder along with chronic depression and a few other problems, does that make me crazy? I'm really not sure but guess I will figure it out eventually. Right now I'm still trying to figure out why one of my two sons is being so nice and trying his best to support me and the younger son refuses to talk to me. This is giving me more heartache than anything else.

Suic-786,"Loneliness, isolation, suffering and lack of support is going to kill me","I had a serious and rare diagnosis 20 months ago and my mortality was thrown in my face. its brought up my shocking upbringing and trauma I have endured and I have worked hard to make a good life from all the horror but now this. I turn to my friends. and family and I am ignored. I asked my sister and best friend for company -expressed clearly my loneliness and sadness and that I was suicidal. hey ignored me (I am safe right now - just) I have messaged about 3 other friends explaining this and reaching out even telling them what happened - I can see they read the message and they didn't reply. My husband went away to work like 2 states away knowing I was in this lonely place and had just gotten out of psych hospital for being suicidal. My older daughter lives over the border with my grandkids and she knows how troubled I am and barely calls barely meets up. I now realise its all me who makes the effort in these relationships. My Dr gave her a letter so she can come here to give me support but she never used it. My younger child is a teen so she's always out. My one friend this side of the border had asked me over and cancelled. I don't know how long I can hang in there and I'm wondering what im hanging in there for. im getting sicker and sicker I have treatments every 3wks at oncology ward, I have no quality of life and a lot of chronic pain and fatigue but I make the effort for everyone else and they take advantage of it and push me for their needs and when I need them they are nowhere. I can't cope with this, I guess I just need to vent and a chat. im trying my best to get thru until these borders open. Someone has caused me to be suicidal as I am treated like a criminal crossing for my life saving treatments and I can't see my family.

I don't even mean to do it but the instinct to protect myself is so strong.

Suic-793,Stuck in limbo,"I've suffered from depression and anxiety as long as I can remember, so suicidal thoughts have just been part of the landscape for me but I gradually learned to sort of ignore them. Unfortunately I was recently struck by a sort of double tragedy. I'm losing my wife (in the sense that she doesn't love me anymore) due to her own issues with anxiety. She was the absolute highlight of my life and I always treated her that way, but that wasn't enough. I have no support system at all, so I decided to contact one of the only 2 other people in my life who really ever knew me. I hadn't talked to her in years, but when I looked her up the first thing I saw was her obituary. In the past I could always find some kind of vague sense of hope to keep going, even if it was sometimes only a vague notion that things would get better somehow. Now the only thing that is keeping me alive is the knowledge of what my death would do to my wife, yet every moment of every day consists of me either crying or feeling abject emptiness. Can't die, but can't live either. My gp, therapist, and psychiatrist are all well aware of my situation. I've been on every class of antidepressant available, including antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, but nothing has any effect on me. I've been referred for TMS and ""a certain party drug now used to treat depression"" (can't say the name on here). Failing those, my psychiatrist wants me to get ECT, but I don't know how I can deal financially with 6 weeks off work as this would also impact my wife. It's even hard to see the point in any of those, as literally nobody cares whether I live or die apart from the sense of guilt that taking my own life would bring them. Such an odd feeling, given that I wouldn't be around to see the impact anyway. I don't know why I'm even writing this. Guess I just needed to whinge a bit more despite the fact that it doesn't really fix anything. Having said that, I do feel like if I'm not going to die then I should at least lend my life to someone/something that can use it.

I don’t know how to deal with him being here but not really being here. I have a plan and I desperately want to go through with it but I don’t want him to blame himself at all, I know he’s helped me more than I deserve but I’m worried that he might not realise that (I have told him). I’ve been trying to actually see someone in person at headspace (even though I know it won’t help and will just be another source of stress). We spent over a week doing phone tag to set up an intake call, then the date we scheduled the duty worker was sick, so a new time was scheduled but they called late so I was driving cause I had given up on waiting, then when I called back they said they’d call back in 2 minutes snd they haven’t called even though that was days ago. I knew that trying to get help was probably gonna make things harder but I didn’t expect it to make things harder before I’d even started. I just alternate between paralysing anxiety and not having the energy to care about anything. Lately they’ve been blending into one, I just live vaguely distracted, not doing the things that I need to or making important decisions, but with fear inside. The hole in my chest is back, but the edges used to be blurry and numb. Now they’re torn and ragged and they hurt so much. Everything just hurts. I miss him even though he’s still here. I hate myself for not being productive but I still don’t do anything. I’m actively trying to get help because he said I had to but it seems impossible. None of it is worth it.

It's just constant and by this point and It's been affecting me from going to school, doing my school work and going out with my friends. Lately I've started avoiding everyone who tries to see if I'm alright and I just want to isolate myself from everyone just in case I do something stupid. I really don't know what to do at this point because the urges have been telling me to......hurt myself badly and then I know I don't want that because I've always been afraid of pain.

Suic-798,"I want to try again, my mind wants me to give up.","Hi everyone, I’ve been struggling for nearly four weeks with feelings of suicide/self-harm/worthlessness. In 2018 my mental health was at its worst after my husband left me, I moved into a small flat and isolated myself from the few friends I had. Soon after I left my long term job as I could no longer cope with the stress . I eventually used all my savings and suddenly found myself living in my mother’s lounge room just as the pandemic hit. I think I can count on my hand the number of times I left the house in that year. I eventually tried to make small changes, did some casual work and tried to reconnect with the few friends that responded to my messages. I also started going to therapy again at least once a fortnight to try and get some help to make changes in my life. In July I was lucky enough to find a part time job I was excited about, in a new field. It was hard to learn new things, expose myself to people again, hell even my one hour public transport ride to the office and back started off feeling like a marathon of anxiety every day, but I did it and I started to feel a sense of pride and hope I haven’t felt for many years. Then those little bumps started to come, my supervisor resigned and I found myself as the new person trying to keep things afloat etc. My sleep patterns were off and when I did sleep nightmares invaded my head and I’d wake up in a sweat with muscle aches/cramps. I kept going.. then a caught a nasty cold that just wouldn’t go away and one morning I found myself on a crowded bus and I just started crying, I could not stop it was like a leaking tap I couldn’t shut off. It felt like a crack that I’d been working really hard to keep sealed just burst open and I panicked. I tried to be a ‘good parent’ to myself and say it’s ok, this sort of stuff happens when you’re under pressure and feeling unwell but ever since that day it feels like my body has given in to my worst feelings of depression/anxiety. At first I had to take time off because I was physically sick with the cold etc but now I’ve recovered I still haven’t been able to return to work or leave the house. My whole body feels like it’s weighted down. If I don’t return to work tomorrow as I have promised I fear that I will be fired. The thought of having to go through the job search/Centrelink/interview process again makes me feel like I’m going to be sick.

I'm young with a successful career that I had to work hard for, own my own home, have 2 wonderful dogs and live right on the beach but I'm not happy. I'm never happy. I just want to sleep and not wake up. I'm not actively suicidal (although I have been in the past), I just don't want to have to do anything anymore. The best way to describe it I think is that I just want a break from life. It's almost like I have too much. I don't want the responsibility of my job, I don't want to have to deal with looking after myself let alone my dogs, I need everything to stop so that I can stop for a bit. I have tried to explain this to my psychologist and either she doesn't understand what I am saying or I'm not understanding how we are working on it because I still don't know what to do. I constantly have to fight to ignore the intrusive self harm thoughts that are constantly there either nagging at the back of my mind or yelling at the front of my thoughts. I don't want to go back to self harming after working so hard to break that habit but recently it feels more and more like a good option that would just provide some relief. I'm open to any advice but what I think would be really helpful is any unique or new ideas on how to avoid or replace self harm when I have no energy or motivation to do anything. I feel like I have heard everything and tried basically all of it before but this is sort of my last ditch effort at scrambling for ideas that I might not know of before I run of energy.

Suic-803,BEYOND BELIEF,"I am depressed and distraught. My 80 yr old father is in hospital with abdominal pain and an unidentified infection. Two nights ago my narcissistic , alcoholic brother phoned him and told him he was thinking and doing everything wrong. My brother kept pushing until my father snapped and started arguing back. In the end my father hung up and collapsed in a heap with pain. My brother rang back and my mother grabbed the phone. My brother kept up the argument with my mother. By the end of the call my mother was shaking. I decided enough was enough. I blocked his phone number on both of their phones and sent him a message stating that there would be a hiatus in communication for 30 days. He had that time to learn to be compassionate,kind and respectful toward our parents.As they have always had his back. Last night my mother and I had returned from visiting my father and my mother went out the front. The next thing I could hear yelling. I opened the door and walked outside. My brother had used another phone and called my mother.He was screaming at her and arguing. Then she started yelling at me saying I had blocked my brother's number and how dare I make that decision. I unblocked the number and then she accused me of telling the hospital to say my father wasn't there when my brother rang. I don't have that authority it was somebody typing in the wrong name or misspelt name. Then she started having a go at me for seeking treatment for my mental illness. My entire family are too thick to comprehend that depression can and does last longer than 2-6wks.

Suic-807,Feeling like you don't belong,"I just need to get this out of my system. I constantly feel like I don't belong anywhere. My older sisters look at me like I'm a complete weirdo because I'm so different to them, my little sister knows exactly how to get under my skin and my older brother is the only one who is nice to me. They think I'm weird because I watch anime, and hate dresses and skirts, don't like going out, am on my computer all the time, stay up till 3 in the morning drawing, am 'music-obsessed'... I'm also pansexual and they don't know that, but it just feels like I'm so alone. My older brother also watches anime and is an introvert so he kinda gets me, but it means I'm constantly anxious about disappointing him. At school I never get angry or sad, I hide it because none of my friends expect to see negativity from the 'bubbly and positive friend.' My smile shakes sometimes and I always keep laughing even when it's not funny, and at home I'm the opposite. The bottom room is my haven away from the world where I can play piano and violin, get lost in books and fanfiction, write for hours, do art to my heart's content... And my parents are worried because I yell at them to get out when I'm in the middle of something. It feels constantly like everyone has high expectations of me when I'm in the A-team for netball, when really I'm the worst in my team as everyone else is consistently playing amazingly while I play defense and just stay on my player, don't make any flashy intercepts. The night is the only time when I can take a break from everything and just watch youtube or anime... And at school I'm supposed to be 'smart' and 'talented.' I'm a procrastinator and average 70s-80s when I expect 90s and beat myself up about it. Whenever I do something wrong I self-harm, but I can't relate to SH on other harms because it feels like it's not serious. I'm in the first year of high school and haven't got a lot of friends.. One is constantly hitting me hard as a joke but it really hurts and I can't say anything because it would be a buzzkill. Her other friend does it too.

Suic-808,I’m tired and I can’t see a future,"I’ve been unwell for nearly 2 years now, 5 medication changes and I thought the ones I’m on now were working until 4 weeks ago and the suicidal thoughts have come back. I’m 32 and I’m tired and I can’t see a future. I have an amazing partner, a job I actually like, and more money saved than I ever have, and a plan for University and what I wanted to do career wise and yet that doesn’t seem enough. All I feel like is a failure and that all I’ve done throughout my life is fail and that I deserved all the bad things that happened to me. I’ve made so many mistakes which I wish I could take back. I feel so unaccomplished and this is the lowest I’ve felt. All I can think about lately is just to end it so the pain stops and that I don’t burden anyone. The mornings are the worst time and I just don’t want to wake up. I just feel there are so many people who would be happy to see me gone, and that the people who wouldn’t would be fine after a week. Life goes on right? I’m so sick of hurting.. and I’m hurting my partner in the process, all I want to do is push him away. He’s a psychiatric nurse and he understands but he would be so much better off without me. I feel like I’ve ruined his life. I’ve ruined my own life by not having all the things you’re meant to have by the time you reach your 30’s. There’s so much I regret and im so angry at myself. I don’t know how much longer I can keep going for..",Britishinaus,Community Member,19-10-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,7,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-m-tired-and-i-can-t-see-a-future/td-p/146
Suic-809,how do i tell my friends about my SH?,"Im a teenager who unfortunately selfharms. Its become a coping mechanisim for months now. and ever since ive started, not one soul knows about it. and everytime i try to tell someone, i delete it. I know my friends would care for me, but i dont want to burden them. Friend 1: Suffers from an ed, so I dont want to make her feel invalidated, or put more onto her plate and make her feel like she cant talk to me. Friend 2: Also suffers from his own problems and I dont want to put this news on him- I dont want to make him feel like its his obligation. Friend 3: she also has her own problems and I dont wish to put this on her. Friend 4: She has alot going on and if i dont know if shed understand. I just dont know who to tell or who to talk too? I recently became almost 2 months clean and I lost it. Everytime I was happy about being sober, i couldnt be happy with the people I care for. Everytime I lost my sobriety, i couldnt have gone to anyone to talk to. I just do not want to bother them with my problem, I dont want to make them feel like they have to walk on eggshells. I dont want to make them upset or cry. Because I know soemthing like this can put alot of pressure on someone because its not an easy topic.

Suic-810,"A failure, and rightfully so","Hello, first time poster and apologies if most of this post is venting. At my age (28F) I haven't had a single lasting job that made me financially independent. I came to Australia as a young adult on my own, and due to naivety and negligence, I always ended up being tricked out of rightful pay, ended up doing my absolute best on unpaid labor with hopes for paid work that never come, and just financial uncertainty after another. I also ended up with tons of work rejection, either for visa reason, lack of work experience, and one time, just blatant racism. There's over a hundred of these rejection in fact and it ate me up so much, I have instant anxiety whenever I logged in to job seeking sites. It always felt like the word 'Failure' just hung over my head. After a turnover in my choice of career, today was supposed to be the first day I could start work and hopefully change that life around. And instead of working I fell sick and due to the current situation with Covid, I was told not to come in. I cry myself with worry over whether or not I can still keep that work, I feel like I started of my first step very, very wrongly, and could only uselessly cry as I try to salvage this situation by calling the employer and even started applying for work again. My parents back home were extremely disappointed, as I know it's very shameful that I'm 28 who only now could have the hope of a stable career and I blew it. They kept shouting at me that crying is useless, but it's not like it's a faucet I can just turn off when I want. Worse of all, and the reason why I'm here, is because I found myself going back to self-harming. The reason for the career change was because, though I was not diagnosed and did not have the funds to do so, I suspect I have depression, considering the few suicide attempt I had before and just general feel of uselessness and listlessness that goes on every day. Like everything I did will always end up as failure anyway, there is no point in trying. Every day of my life, every little thing I do always felt like it has a massive consequences and it cause even the smallest, most irrational failure to make me break down. I'm aware many of this experience and my failure is rightfully my own fault, because i place myself in this situation and I am responsible for the many situation I ended up in. But if I want to keep living, I don't want to keep feeling like this. Please give me advice on how not to slip back to old habits like this.",DecemberFly,Community Member,25-10-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/a-failure-and-rightfully-so/td-p/11418
Suic-811,No trust left!,"Today has just proven that i cannot trust anyone. Had just finished putting groceries away after picking them up. Sat down to think about what i was going to have for lunch(was starving at the time but now i just want to vomit) then there was a knock at the door. Was the police! Immediate thought was what the hell has happened now???? The last time i had to deal with the police was when someone was harassing and stalking me at work about 2 months ago. They took a statement and that was it. They explained why they were at my front door : apparently i had sent an email to centrelink telling them im going to kill myself!! And they were doing a welfare check. 1. I have no memory of sending such email. I didnt even think centrelink has an email?? 2. If i really wanted to kill myself, centrelink would be the last people id be telling. 3. Even though ive been feeling shit the last few weeks, i havent had thoughts of suicide. So i dont know how this has come to be! Has someone pretended to be me?? Did i actually send an email off but some remember?? I mean my medications make me sleepy and i have been that tired in the past where i have unknowingly answered calls but to write an email? I dont know whats happened. Naturally i freaked out. They start asking more questions and of course after whats happened in the last few months, i broke down! Then theyre asking more questions and if id be happy for the community mental health team to cone around to talk. Told them i dont feel ready to talk about it yet and certainly wasnt going to in front of my son. And they werent happy with that were that! So i had to literally wait there for 20mins while someone came out. I had also called my mum to come out, she was 5 mins away. Even when the community mental health team came they almost threatened me telling me if i wasnt going to talk they will admit me to hospital!!! Told them, im a nurse, i know how these things work, whos to say i would actually talk about the issues i have right now even if you admitted me. They basically said i could be there until i talk. I dont even remember what i said next its mostly all a blur now! So im just so freaking pissed off. Whose done this?? Im already stressed, depressed and anxious then this happens only to heighten it! I really feel like i cant trust anyone! Feels like no one is on my side! I just want peace! Im sick of all this drama!

Suic-814,Lost and thinking about dying,"I have lost all direction in life. I just don't know what to do. I'm constantly tired. I have no energy. I feel totally worn out even before I've done anything. I try to keep busy but my mind drifts and I start remembering what took place, 2 years ago and from when I was 3 to nearly 13. I have had no closure ftom either of these. I am seeing a psych for the incident that took place 2 years ago, this is paid for by a 3rd party. I believe that I have worked hard with my psych in dealing with this matter, but realistically I am unsure as I am still having nightmares and flashbacks most nights, the latest has seen me with a bruise that covers most of my upper arm from 'fighting back' something I never did when I was attacked. I still feel as if I failed myself for not fighting back, he said he had a weapon, so I did what he said. I often think I should have fought him, maybe if I did I wouldn't be in the mess I am in. I try hard to think happy things, to take joy in something each day but its so hard. I feel like I am a prisoner in my own body and own house. I am so scared of people that I don't know that I rarely go out. I have only one friend, but I don't like to 'dump and vent' to her so I pretend all is well. Im good at putting on my face The horror that tormented me when I was a child is back now, teasing and tormenting me, telling me I am worthless, not wanted, not good enough, unlovable and it goes on. I told my parents about him when I was younger and they told me not to be silly, I told them more than once and I got the same reply, so I managed to keep it to myself and cry st night, I'm still doing that, crying to try and get some relief from the day. The only thing I am sure of is day becomes night and night becomes day. I haven't told my doctor or psych about my tormentor, I don't want to be told to stop being silly and imagining things. I think about dying, its not something I really want yet, but I know I would be free of all of this, the pain would be gone for me, but it would just start for my family.

I feel like I am currently straddling the line between being here and not. I’ve suffered with depression since I was 13. This time around I have been on medication for about 10 years - most times the highest dose allowed for my medication. I have a history of entering relationships with narcissistic men. I’ve recently discovered that this happens because I feel so alone and worthless, that the love bombing is like a drug that suddenly makes everything feel better. my first relationship with a narcissist started when I was 19 and I left 8 years later, when my daughter was 8 months. The first time he laid hands on me was 6 months in.The violence over the years continued and became normalised. The only reason I left was because the police said they would take my baby away. I was so indoctrinated. When I left I was suicidal. I self harmed a lot instead. But, I got better. Became incredibly successful at work. Had a few short relationships before deciding I needed to be alone. I was alone for 10 years. No dates. Nothing. Then I decided one day I wanted to be in A relationship. I found a man who I thought was the one. Things moved quickly. He gave me so much attention. Told me he loved me after a month. Started talking about marriage and babies - everything I needed to hear. I didn’t know what live bombing was at this stage. After 3 months I started to let my walls down. Things flourished for a bit longer before he realised he had won. He convinced me to come off my medication to improve our sex life. So I did. Within a week I was a mess. I felt crazy.

There was another girl online that purposely lead me on just for leading on just for fun. She said so herself and that made me feel even worse to the point where I felt like it was me against everyone else. My so called friends were no help either, they just laughed. Now a days it’s still the same story & the same scenarios happening and I’ve had enough. I want to know why the whole community hate me and want me dead.

That other job wasn't for me, so I'm currently back with the family business. I find performing even the simplest of tasks hard and try to avoid, which only makes the situation worse. I've had other job offers, but i cant get past the fact that i will hate the job and not be able to perform them, also choosing the which one to take seems near impossible.

When I went through my mental health journey I suffered with severe anxiety OCD with this anxiety disorder it was also accompanied with very dark intrusive thoughts, these thoughts really scared me. The thoughts increased my anxiety, every time they would pop into my mind I could feel my anxiety peak….. Why was I having these thoughts? I had a great life but my mind would keep playing these horrible dark intrusive thoughts they were on repeat.. it was very overwhelming the emotions I felt during this time were very intense. I knew I needed help I was in distress and I couldn’t navigate these thoughts on my own. I made an appointment with my gp, while discussing what I was going through I was advised that these dark intrusive thoughts sometimes accompany anxiety and depression. At the time of visiting my gp I didn’t know the full extent of my anxiety…. I have now received treatment from health professionals for what I was experiencing and these dark intrusive thoughts have now lifted for me. I have now recovered. I just want people to know to please don’t suffer in silence, talk about your thoughts… it’s nothing to be ashamed of… please seek help through your gp or call Beyond Blue and speak to a trained councillor: 1300 22 4636 you don’t have to go through this alone.

Suic-823,The Covert Narcissist is the weak one!!,"I have lived through many years of being around a Covert Narcissist. They nourish the vulnerable (including our OLD selves) with their Narcissistic supply. They control their environment with ""stress-driving motivational compliance"". Stress is crippling, its incredibly unpleasant, both mentally and physically. When they have you, they can reach you wherever and whenever they want.. Just a text! It can bend you like Darth Vader's evil use of the force. If you want to understand the full psychologically horror of trying to live with/in a dominance hierarchy of a covert narcissist, watch Ex Machina. ""Eve"" has most hallmarks - manipulative, intelligent, beautiful, powerful, mirroring, uncanny valley/not human. For 95% of the film she's the victim (literally imprisoned) but the last 5min you discover her core is evil. She's not only been using you the whole time , but leaves you for dead with effortless cruelty. You're exhausted after watching this film, it's non-stop paranoia and anxiety. And she never directly agrees' the victim! I understand its childhood abuse mental torture - like holding someones head under water..to effect obedience, sick security. A 'false self' is built shielding a fragile, cowering 'true self' core. Decades this early split diverges a highly functional, immaculately crafted public shell which is rewarded by much of what is broken in society. A commensurately tormented 'suffering soul' festers at the core, like the stench of rotten fish. The psychopath is banished to scour the barren plains of the psyche for the entirety of their existence, their soul like a snarling wolf, addicted to perpetually predating on the weak. Feeding insatiably on the vulnerability and emotional destruction of the innocent lives they can manage to trap around them (Because emotional AB-use literally means it's them that cant function at the rest of us normal humans need to) They abuse their power to 'twist the fabric of reality', suppress/never deal with hard problems. They can afford to live an avoidance of hard truths and so damn themselves, subconsciously to live and act out their delusion to perpetuity. My God, Don't go near them and don't agrees them. They are like Chernobyl.

I eventually couldn't handle it anymore so I left him but he promised he'd get help so we eventually got back together. He'd still say some horrible things to me but he never got properly angry up until the last month, where he's started to have a few of these outbursts again. I know deep down it's not healthy and i am scared to be alone with him, but i just can't bring myself to leave because when he's not angry he's the kindest most perfect boyfriend i could ask for. He has history of these outbursts with his family as well. He's never purposefully gotten physical, just pushed me multiple times when i've tried to stop him from hurting himself during the outbursts. i'm just so lost with what to do.",pinkbutterfly,Community Member,01-10-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/boyfriend-with-anger-issues/td-p/12268
Suic-831,I hate my life,"Hi My name is Justin. I’m new here at beyondblue and I don’t know much about it but I’m hoping I can get some support because of what I’m going through. Let me explain: in 2017 I dropped out of high school year 10 because I had some anxiety, people would constantly sniffle and cough during classes, this type of sneaky bullying destroyed my developing mind. I was then stuck at home depressed and hopeless then my Aunt started sniffing so I told her to leave my house live in the garage, then she developed cancer but I still couldn’t live with her because of her sniffing. My Aunt died at the hospital , I was then kneeling at the hospital bed where my Aunt died then someone started coughing it was one of the nurses, so I shouted at her and threatened to kill her after just witnessing my Aunt die. After adjusting my life without my Aunt I felt depressed hopeless and stupid but my irritation to people coughing at me only returned with a vengeance. I stayed at home for 2 years in a row WITHOUT LEAVING my home. I felt like a damn BOO RADLEY. Then my next door neighbors started sneezing and coughing, so guess what I switched house. So I left my home first time in 2 years, the home movers workers also started coughing. I’ve been admitted to a mental hospital but got nothing out of it only more frustration and hopelessness .Now I’m a helpless unemployed loser taking medication and regularly visiting my psychologist; who also happens to cough but she says it’s her itchy throat which I reckon is bullshit. These days I am planing to go back to school so I can get a good job but I am going to have to face my fears which is by all the most horrifying thing I will ever have to face. If you are reading this maybe you to want to cough.

Suic-832,I think my little sister is self-harming,"She has these scars on her ankle that look very similar to self harm and I don't know what to do. I'm extremely worried about her as she was diagnosed with an ED earlier this year and had to stay in a psych ward for a week or so. I would approach her about it, but the thing is I haven't self harmed in about 8 months and I want to keep it that way - talking about it can be triggering for me. I don't know what to do because I'm her older sister and I feel like it's all my fault because I've suffered with depression, suicide attempts and self-harm ever since I was young.",sk8ergrl,Community Member,22-09-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,5,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-think-my-little-sister-is-self-harming/td-p/14322
Suic-833,Numb,"Hi all, I feel so numb and exhausted from everything I’ve done to myself. I can’t explain it. I remember some things but I don’t remember how I got there and that still scares me. I’m coming up to one year since my last suicide attempt and one month since my last self harm. I know people tell me that I’m unwell when I lose control but how can I make sure that I’ll never lose control again? I’ve stuck to most of the agreements I made with the treating team in hospital since my last attempt and when I think of suicide I tell myself that’s not an option, but I have self harmed since and don’t remember much of it and that scares me. Will there ever be a time when I don’t have to be on the lookout, monitoring my moods and having a safety plan? Will there ever be a time when I don’t need a carer, treating team, interventions? What will happen when my carer dies? That’s a true fear of mine as I’ve lost too many people too young. I just don’t remember what happens to me when I’m unwell.

But it always goes back to my sister I would hurt her. This past week I have been struggling I cannot get back for a special event due to border restrictions. I was seeing a guy who then just ghosted me. I turn 36 next month and all I want is to start a family. I feel like the hatred I have towards myself turns anyone away. I feel so sad but I can't express it and I feel trapped with these thoughts then getting louder. Distraction at night is not working resulting in me not having slept in days.

Suic-837,I am turing 30 soon,"When I was a teen, I promised myself that I would get far far away from my family and end my life at 30. Many years later, I managed to leave my family in China. I thought I had been cured since then. Over here, I have a loving husband and an 8 months old daughter. I thought I would never want to give up my life again. Now I am turning 30 soon, I can't stop thinking about my old plan. This time, I choose not to tell my husband as I don't want to drag him into the endless hopelessness I feel all the time. I start to think what if I didn't have a husband or a daughter. Then I'd be free to do what I want to do. I've been thinking of divorce but fear that he'd be too heart broken to look after our little one. I have thought of seeing my GP for this but don't have the courage yet.

Suic-839,I’m new and need to share.,"Hey guys, I’m 20 years old and ever since I was 15 I’ve had medical issues. So bad that I’ve been in and out of hospital nearly every two months since them. They aren’t all linked and there’s a lot of them but I’m going to focus on the illness I have the most control over. My asthma. I was diagnosed two years ago and was told I’ve had it my whole life but as someone who did lots of good things for it in school it wasn’t an issue. If anyone else has asthma then you would know if your on the right preventer most of the time your gonna be fine. But I have had issues with the kind of attention you need to keep up with those things due to mental conditions that are still being diagnosed. So sometimes I miss it. If you’ve every been on every day medication and missed taking it one day doesn’t really make a difference a few do. But what happens if at that point I’m struggling so much and I feel like a waste of time and space. So why let myself get better if this is my mistake. But sometimes I feel like it’s cause I want to hurt cause everything is just so overwhelming that I go numb and I would do anything to find that pain again. This is the way in which I think I’ve come to self harm and even possibly be suicidal. But I don’t have any support either. My mum doesn’t deal with mental health and due to how often I’m in hospital she doesn’t really deal with the physical either. My dad id love to talk to but every time I freak out and hid his so mad and disappears that I know over wasted his time. My best friend in the whole world the only person I can be myself around. I no longer what to be around. I have a brother and sister who don’t talk to me. I just don’t see the point. They tell me to get better and move on but how can I do that when I know I’m gonna be in hospital again in a few months, away from work for a week all my sick days for the year gone in my first two months, showing me as unreliable.

Suic-840,"Depression, Anxiety and a whole new level of being unwell","I am writing this as I suppose that I just need to get everything off my chest. I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for years now and it has somewhat been managed with medication, therapy and everything alternative you can think of. I have always been willing to try anything to be better and to be able to function. I feel like I am quite knowledgeable in the field too as I work in mental health. Lately I received the amazing news that I am pregnant... what a blessing. I am over the moon knowing that the body that I thought broken has been able to produce a little bubba. Pregnancy is going well apart from the constant morning/day/night sickness which seem to never end. With the pregnancy comes a huge hormonal change and I have not been coping with this at all. My mental health has deteriorated drastically with suicidal feelings, guilt and shame for feeling suicidal cause I have no intention of harming my baby. I feel so isolated and lonely as I am stuck with nowhere to go and no one to see in this lockdown. I have not been to work for weeks now which has now resulted in losing all my income and I have not received much support from work although I have disclosed my pregnancy and mental health struggles to my manager. I feel totally lost. I have sessions with my psychologist and talk to my GP who has advised me to go to hospital but this idea scares me so much as I wouldn't be allowed a support person in there with me. I am trying so hard to be strong but I have nothing left in me and I feel like all the tools that I have used in the past to cope are not relevant anymore. It has come to the point where I feed myself just to make sure my baby is fed, I stay hydrated just for the baby but I am insanely worried that my mental health will impact on my baby.

Suic-841,I'm sure it's just me,I thought maybe first time it happened it was a mistake but today again it happened & this is like the fourth or fifth time in as many short months. I was meant to meet up with my counsellor today for a face to face but again she was a no show & still unable to get in contact with her. So it's gotta be me I'm sure not everyone can have this much bad luck with holding onto & being this accepting & forgiving of toxic people. I am feeling like an expert doormat. So I have over thought all afternoon it's gotta be me I am a burden a complete waste of space I have to be I must be invisible. And this isn't the first counsellor to ghost or ditch me so why the heck do I bother why should I keep trying when I am fully aware & I can see I am simply not worth anything. I am absolutely unworthy for this miserable existence. I never would've thought my mediocre tragic sad story would turn this many professionals away from me. They say they are here for me give me space are holding their hands out to support me yet again turning away from me moving the goal posts yet again taking their hand back ignoring & ghosting me.

I’m a minor and I always just assumed that this would be the easy part of life, but it’s not is it? I wish I had a friend. I’m so lonely but I’m afraid too, if I had a friend I’d just inflict my depression on there, it’s like a virus, once you have it you just keep spreading it around too all the people you love. But I don’t anymore, I don’t love. What’s the point? Of all of this. Of my existence. Of living the best life you can because it’s the only one you have. I want to hide away from the world and sometimes I just want to be seen by someone. I often wonder if it’s all just a sick dream. Is it all real. I wish it wasn’t. I feel like in this past year I have lost everything that has ever ment something to me, family, love, happiness, gratitude and friends. I don’t think I want this all too be real. I know there are other people like me out there somewhere but I can’t help too feel so alone. I just want to talk to someone sometimes just about little things like their day, but why would anyone every talk to someone who doesn’t speak. My parents don’t understand. I know that’s such a typical teenage thing too say and I guess some how it is true. They know I’m not okay, but they think I’m better now then I was before and I don’t know how to tell them I’m not, they have no clue how to help me, I won’t speak, go on meds, or do anything really, and I think they think that if they get me nice little gifts like a shirt I like or something little then I’ll be happy and okay. And I know this sounds selfish like wealthy kid shit but sometimes I just wish they didn’t. I mean its sweet but it makes me feel like a dog or something. I feel so many feelings, too many, but sometimes nothing and maybe that’s worst, I’m not sure. I don’t think I want to feel, but I’m afraid that if I feel nothing all the time then I don’t really know, but it won’t be good, and everyone will be mad. I want to run away from my insides before their tear me apart and swallow me. I’m not really sure what I’m trying to get at here. I want help, I don’t know how to get any with my current situation.

Suic-844,Don't want to wake - but no choice,"My lovely 60 yo wife of 18 years is in a nursing home with dementia. She doesn't remember me (or the last 20 years). Before she went in, she wanted to go home (Thailand), her family wanted her home to look after (still think it is OCD - can't get it through to them). She needs to be home, but medically, she is FAR better off here. Otherwise/ways, she is better to be home - where she has a chance of remembering some of her life. I know & understand she needs to be with her family, but I am worried she won't get the care there that she would here. I don't doubt that her sisters would look after her, the next generation down (the more self-centered ones) I'm not so sure about. She's been in the home over a year & I've had less than 3 hours in total with her since. Some of it is COVID related (nothing we can do about that - Thanks Xi!), some of it is her not knowing me. Can't do much about that, either. I'm stuffed/stuck. I want her to go back to the village she knows, but know she won't be medically safe. I want her to stay here for medical (and selfish) reasons, although I have already lost her. I can't afford to keep her at home (here, with me) - I'm not 4 people & would have to give up work. DSS/Centrelink won't cover the rent, let alone anything like food/electricity - and that is with a comparitively cheap rent here. Nursing home fees are bad enough @ $7500 - 7600/month (6k from NDIS) . I feel like there's nobody batting with me - plenty on the sidelines, waiting to see if I fall - I can't do the century alone. I've managed to build up a decent (yet small) bank balance for her. I have life & financial guardianship of her. If I go, the home will go for it. Then ALL of her $ will disappear real quick. I need her to have that to take home. I'm lost. Alone (not lonely).

I wake up almost everyday just wishing i could die it never ussd to be like this say 2-3yrs ago 2019 was i think the best year ive had in a long time, i was working, doing things with my best friend tahlia, my family situation wasnt that bad and i was genuinely happy. After i lost my job its just been this crazy downhill spiral that im desperately trying to pull myself put of but it feels like all my attemps to better myself have backfired hell i dont even know if they have been attemps to help myself or just to set myself up for failure. Losing tahlia cut me deep and its my own fault i pushed her away but i felt we were both pushing each other away. Its only been a year since we officially stopped talking and it kills me i feel like im decaying from the inside out, she was my only friend at the time and since our fallout ive had literally no one ive made no new mates. No one checks up on me nor do they care about my feelings. So yeah after 2019 life was horrid. My mother was actively using meth/ice whatever with her brother he came to live with us. it went on like this until earlier this year. we had to deal with her psychotic outbursts and my uncle when he had nothing and was coming down it was hell at home us girls would get verbally abused by him. Hes been in jail most of his life and came to fuck ours over like i didnt even know what he looked like until i was 16 or so and he just got out of jail and started intoxicating our life. Arguments at home between me and mum got worse thats when i started hitting myself in the head and i havent stopped since when i feel this pent up anger or mums on one of her rages where shes constantly yelling feels like hours and sometimes they are and its so draining listening to her put us down 24/6 and then for a small period shes all lovey dovey you girls know i love you i dont mean any of the things i say you girls know that right. No we dont. its just constant pain is all i feel and its from the people around me and myself i think i hurt myself the most but i dont know how like maybe im in denial or something but i do hurt myself and i take almost everything out on myself.

I didn’t get much support from that and worked on, my symptoms started but I guess crap happens. Seven months later I then had another violent situation at work. All that was asked, was I got clearance for my controlled epilepsy. I stopped work then. I have experienced abuse many times in my career but this one got me. I got 6 months and told to go back, my doctor told me I’d get sacked if I didn’t, so I asked for meds and went. It wasn’t fun. Anxiety, attacks, think of all the symptoms. I got told the incident was nothing by a psychiatrist. Then I was told there was no where for me and I’d had enough, I refused to do anymore, my family were suffering. I was too. So I lost all workcover payment. I also got told my memory loss was because of that controlled epilepsy I have. On to income protection, which we are now fighting for, 7 months no money and about one hour ago I had to tell my daughters I’m a useless piece of crap who has to sell our home to survive, Centrelink won’t touch me as I have case in and income protection still pending. My daughters told me to get a job, I can barely make it through a day. I’m not even sure now which is more traumatic in some respects, the actual incidents or losing my children’s respect. I knew I’d lost most of it already but this finished it. I don’t really care about my home in all honesty, just my girls and I just can’t see any light here. I’ve always seen light before, you do this and this, eventually this will work out but I just don’t know here. I feel so, so alone. I don’t want to die, but that’s all I think about now. The glass between everyone and myself just seems so thick and I hate listening to myself. The nightmares are returning and so are headaches which I thought were controlled with medication. No one seems to be able to help and I don’t even know what that help is supposed to look like. I’m extremely scared. Oh so scared and it’s a shitty thing to say but I wish id ignored the violent situation and just kept working.

Suic-848,Hurtful mind games from ex gf,"Hi all, I’m new here but unfortunately not new to depression. It’s been a long tiring 18 years since it started. I came home after working away in The Kimberley and my daughter of 18 months, son of 6 months and their mother were gone and I had no idea where they were. Bags and boxes were packed in the lounge room with a note simply saying, please take to such and such transport yard. That started a very tough fight for not only my survival, but for the proper upbringing and education I wanted for my kids. 3 years in court going for full custody, and looking at getting it, I found out I wasn’t the biological father of my daughter. She was 4 & half yrs old and within a week her mother told her. I had NO legal right to see her again and as I was paying child support at an unbelievable amount, ( more than my mortgage) I got very little back. anyway it was never about money at all. I fought to protect 2 innocent children that I loved dearly. anyway 2 weeks ago my ex girlfriend was in town ( not the mother of my son by the way) and she came around. I absolutely loved seeing her as I’ve really been struggling the last few months and I’ve been alone and lonely as I moved to a new state. 1 thing led to another and we got close again. It felt so normal and felt to me as we had never broken up. Then she started an argument because I assumed she’d stay the night and I’d taken Monday off work to spend with her. Once again she got upset coz I was disappointed and she stormed out. Never saw her again and didn’t say goodbye when she flew back to my home town in NT that she moved to with her mum when she left me. Then she proceeded to play mind games with me over the next 10 days. Making me feel like she wanted to try again, saying all the things I wanted to hear etc etc. Thursday all was good when I text her to let her know I had a surprise for her. She straight away called to tell me she thought we were not on same page. Even though I’d asked her 3 or 4 times if she was on same page as me. She wanted to know what I wanted and how I felt about her. I told her openly and honestly as normal and she bluntly told me she didn’t want to get back together. After 2 weeks of loving texts etc she told me we were mates and she was on my cheer squad encouraging me due to my depression. That did my head in and I rang to talk to her and she blamed me for upsetting her and told me I hadn’t changed one bit. Last night I wanted to end my life.

Suic-852,I feel like I'm drowning with no way out,"For years I have struggled with Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, self harm, suicidal ideation and last year diagnosed with EUPD (aka Borderline Personality Disorder - so I was told by a new psychiatrist). In the last 4 months I have severely struggled and am now facing the realisation that I am the toxic one in my relationship with my partner whom I've been with for 16years and have 2 young children with. I feel so guilty because of the way my illness has affected my family. My eldest mimics my behaviours when she is emotionally distressed. My partner has said he ""can't go through it again"" and I'm scared of hurting my youngest. I feel I'm causing more harm then good by being here, and have felt this way for a long time. I don't know whether seperating from my partner and leaving my children, to try and heal myself is the right choice when I don't see things getting better. I've tried different forms of therapy, ongoing counselling sessions, medication, but I just want to give up. My partner doesn't trust me with our children because I became so unwell in the past I was close to being admitted to hospital. I saw a GP yesterday (he wasn't much help) and have an appointment next week with a psychologist, I just I don't know how much longer I can keep going.

Suic-854,Lost and overwhelmed with conflicting emotions,"Hi, I feel like I need some advice with a whole range of emotions I have been feeling for the better part of a year and a half. For some background, I have been diagnosed with GAD, SAD and major depression, however, these symptoms and emotions I’m feeling feel so strong and different to ones I’ve felt before. I am so lost with who I am. I don’t know who I am anymore. I have moulded myself into someone who is different with every person I’m with and I don’t know who I am when I’m alone. When I am alone, I’m a mess. I’m anxious, irritable, empty, bored and become angry and frustrated for no particular reason and as such, create problems that don’t exist and take my anger out on my loved ones. I lash our for no reason and say nasty things to people and within 1 hour I regret and have no idea why I’ve been so awful. I’m impulsive and buy things I don’t need, I cut my hair, I drink excessive amounts of alcohol and get ear piercings and tattoos. I can be suicidal and self harm and the next day don’t understand why. I feel ugly, worthless, empty and hate everything about myself. On the flip side, I’m ecstatic. I love myself, almost narcissistic. I think I’m amazing, beautiful and like I am better than everyone else. I’m on top of the world. Sometimes, I feel like there is no in between these emotions. They fluctuate so much and it’s exhausting. I still experience anxiety and panic attacks and they have evolved into hurting myself in order to try and manage them. I feel derealisation and detached from my body and the anger later ensues. I have lost complete control over regulating my emotions and it’s now impacting on my family and relationships. I’ve tried to get help but every psychologist I’ve contacted is not accepting new patients. I’m not a danger to anyone, I just cannot control how I feel or manage those intense emotions. Does anyone else experience these extreme mood swings while spending the “down time,” empty and angry? How do you deal with it when you don’t have professional help? I appreciate any advice. Thank you. P.S. I have seen doctors and psychologists in the past, as well as a psychiatric doctor in hospital but only for GAD and depression, not these symptoms.",moonandstars,Community Member,06-09-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/lost-and-overwhelmed-with-conflicting-emotions/td-p/23008

Suic-857,Aftermath,"Just some questions. What happens to those who provide care and support, afterwards? Are they given adequate support and care themselves? How long would it take for a counsellor or psychologist to, in a way, forget a patient they have treated frequently over several months? Do you think they still think about patients even after they stop treating them for awhile? Surely they would maintain a professional distance, no matter how invested they are, do you think they can be emotionally attached to their patient even though it should not be the case? and in a way that they may be irrevocably altered should something happen? I think they may feel a sense of failure, or guilt over what they may have missed, or may have done wrong, I suppose as anyone who knew the person would, even if they were told that it was not their fault.",pl515p1,Community Member,05-09-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/aftermath/td-p/11551

One day we were driving up north and she told me a big list of things I did wrong. I still didnt get it. Once we arrived we had an argument and she told me she wssnt in love with me any more but was in love with this other man. I begged her to stay with me and she did. She told me she would try in our marriage but refused to give him up. In short over the next few years she told me another 4 times she was in love with him. She also told me a number of times she would choose him over me if I made her choose. These days she tells me she loves me and isbt in love with him and it's just friendship. She cant understand why I cant just forgive and move on. Ive got depression and something like ptsd. I cant live without her, but I can see shes getting to the point of bot wanting me to stay because she cant deal with my meltdowns when I get bouts of depression. I dont know what to do. I seriously wish I would just have a heart attack and die, trouble is I believe in afterlife and csnt bear the thought of going thru eternity without her love. She tells me she loves me yet Katy night said if I have one more meltdown that will be it. I'm seriously thinking of committing suicide but if i fail she will lose all her li e for me and I'll be alive without her love, if i succeed i gotta go through eternity without her.

I try to keep up but there's just so much, I find myself waking up to go to Webex calls and then falling back asleep in 5 minutes' time and ending up missing it. I know from experience that calling the school and explaining won't help anything, because work is the priority. I've never done drugs sadly, but school makes me feel like I'm some sort of destructive addict ruining everything for their family because their mental health is in tatters.

The feelings and thoughts going on inside of me are dark and scary and I can’t fight them anymore. The thoughts of wanting to feel numb and pain free and to stop the scary thoughts get stronger the more time this goes on for. I sick and tired of fighting this never ending battle that doesn’t ever seem to end. You go along thinking you’re finally going to be ok for awhile and something happens to trigger everything off again and you’re right back to where you started from. Is there more to life than this pain and hurt and darkness and scary thoughts that take over?? so much has happened in the last year but I can’t seem to bounce back from it all and the usual distractions and tools that are useful aren’t working and I’m not sleeping well I just want to escape from this and I feel so alone,Krazykat5,Community Member,25-08-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,6,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/first-time-here-and-in-a-really-bad-place/td-p/7317

Suic-867,Struggling,"I'm new to the forums, despite the fact that I probably should have been on here years ago. The pandemic has been hard on everyone, myself included. I have lost my job at a University, where I have been a casual, but with consistent work, for 8 years. I had been planning to change career paths, but that plan, as well as every other plan collapsed this week with my wife and best friend saying that she wants to separate. I know that living with someone with depression and anxiety can be difficult, but she always assured me that she loved me and would always stand by me. I'm sure she meant it at the time, but even then I knew on some level that eventually she would get tired of it. I have been crying for three days with very little intermission. I have absolutely no support system, as I have no friends at all and I am estranged from my family. In a nutshell, the future I had been dreaming of is completely shattered. This would not be quite as distressing if I were still young, but I have just turned 47, so starting over, especially with debts, will not be easy at all. To make matters worse, I am struggling to see any point in starting over. I was pretty dissatisfied with the world before this, but always had my wife to remind me that it's not all bad. She didn't even have to say anything. Just knowing she was there was enough. Now she's not. I haven't eaten nor stopped crying for any real period of time in over 2 days and can't sleep without a lot of help from prescription drugs. I have always thought that I had the tools to deal with most issues that life sends my way, but this is so much worse than I ever could have imagined. I'm desperate for someone to talk to, but most therapists are booked out and the hotlines haven't been much help due to the short consultation times and the fact that I can't even see who I'm talking to. Keeping busy doesn't help, as reality just hits that much harder when I'm done with whatever I was doing. I wouldn't kill myself (at least in the short term) as I know how much it would hurt her, but I don't really see the point in living a pointless existence either, so I'm at an impass.

I can't leave my mother tho but at the same time the thoughts and I guess you could say voices are eating me alive. I know I need therapy but I can't bring myself to do it. I always say ""why should I? They don't know me so how are they gonna help"" I don't want just a random person to help me. I want someone I trust. Someone I love. Someone that genuinely cares about me.

I've studied a few tafe courses the last three years, spent a lot of time clearing out my previous house before moving as well as losing weight. I've never had a job or a girlfriend. And now, I honestly don't care about those things anymore. I cry every night or every second night and I can't sleep until the early hours of the morning.

My dad has burnout worse than I do. I'm not sure how I can really help him though with the issues I'm going through. Recently, I'd say a lot of my days are terrible. Some are okay and even good but those are few and far between. I'm so sick and tired of life in general. I've tried my best but I don't know how much more of this I can take. I'm currently enrolled in a uni course but I don't feel like I deserve to be there. It's like I'm taking up a spot that another student should have. I also don't believe I'll ever be happy on a regular basis. I would give up all my material possessions like my figurines if I could truly be happy the majority of my life. The only thing I want to do is encourage a few people at uni before I die. I want other people to do well in life and the course regardless of what happens to me. Suicide has seemed like my only option for a number of years now. I could have been happy but it's not meant to be. Moving hasn't changed that and I'm surprised at how stressed, depressed and anxious I've felt in 2021. I've also been pushing people away for a number of years now so they don't get to know me. My death would only hurt them too. Besides they're better off without me. I think I've wasted my life and any shot at happiness. I'm 27 years old and I dread having to live even a few more years on this planet. My parents by comparison are in their 60s and I told them that I wouldn't want to reach their age. That's too long for me. The only thing that has kept me going the last few years has been helping my mum and dad along with studying. Now that we've moved my parents don't need me to help financially as much. I'm also not enjoying uni because I'm socially inept, depressed and anxious. I'm seeing my gp next Wednesday for medication. At least that numbs my feelings, I suppose. Has anyone else got any advice?

Suic-878,Feeling blah,"Hi everyone, Idk if this is the right place to post this but today, I just have the overwhelming want to just disappear. Not in a suicidal way - I have no urge to kill myself at all. But more in a “I don’t deserve to be here, and whether if I’m here or not won’t make much of a difference so what’s the point anyway?” Kind of way. I usually feel like this when I feel like I’ve hurt someone’s feelings (even if it’s unintentional) or if I have done something wrong in general. And I usually turn to scratching and picking at my skin to deal with feeling like such a terrible person and wanting to disappear because I’m such a terrible person. It feels weird posting this here because I don’t feel like this all the time, and it feels like my brain is almost faking it. Most days I feel happy to be around my family, friends, and my boyfriend and although work is stressful, I enjoy what I do. But when days like today roll around, it feels absolutely unbearable that I can’t even comprehend how the good days can be so good. These days don’t happen that often (maybe once a month or so), so maybe I’m just overreacting. I don’t even know why I’m posting this. I guess I think I just want to know if it’s normal to feel like this and I’m just overreacting. Is this normal? Does everyone usually have these thoughts when they’re upset? I’ve been thinking of seeing a therapist and I’ve put it off for so long thinking that I’m not “bad enough”. Plus, I don’t even know where to start looking.

Suic-879,I hate myself,"Hey, im new here and I think I just needed somewhere to share all these feelings ive been bottling up. I while ago I met a guy who ill call M, and he was my ex boyfriends bestfriend. I fell really hard for M and I let him do whatever he want to me because I thought that would make him like me back. He played with my head from the start, telling me he had feelings for me and then only a few days later taking it all back. I feel like everything we did together caused me to get attached to him and every night I would spend hours crying over him because I was scared he was using me. To me he was the most amazing person, and I thought he was perfect for me. We were incredibly similar and had the same sense of humour and just understood eachother. I ended up doing something stupid which I didnt think he would care about and he removed me and told everyone I was disturbing names. It really shattered me and so many people who had never even met me turned against me. I ended up seeing him a while after it ended and he told me he hated my personality and hated who I was as a person. It absolutely destroyed me. I knew then that he had used me and lead me on and id never felt worse about myself. I was already self-harming before he removed me, but after it got so much worse. He took away all my confidence and made me question everything about myself. I can't talk to people like how I used too because in the back of my mind there is always a little voice reminding me of what he said. I can't look at myself in the mirror without thinking badly and im just so tired. He made me hate myself.

Suic-880,my best friend triggers my self harm.,"trigger warning: self harm & suicidal thoughts i have an extremely unhealthy attachment to my best friend, i dont know why im like this but the way she acts towards me just affects my mood so much. if her tone towards me changes even slightly, i panic and cry and hyperventilate because i think shes going to leave me. and often times when this happens, i resort to self h@rm. she doesnt directly trigger my self h@rm of course, and my self h@rm is not her fault, but the way she acts towards me just affects me so so much. when we get along well, my depression practically goes away, and i feel ecstatic all day. i will feel warm and fuzzy all day and thank the universe for blessing me with such a perfect friend. but the moment her tone changes and she becomes blunt, i panic and my mood PLUMMETS and i fall into a depressive episode, and i usually dont come out of that episode until our friendship goes back to normal. when she becomes blunt with me, i also suddenly start to hate her and despise her, and get urges to just cut her off completely. i dont know why i can just jump between loving her with all the cells in my body and putting her on a pedestal, to hating her guts and wanting to end our friendship within a span of literally 10 seconds. whenever her tone changes and i feel like she hates me, i usually panic and self h@rm, and my su-cidal thoughts become so much worse. i have thoughts and fantasies of k-lling myself and blaming her in my su-cide note, and i have gotten as far as writing the note before. i did not actually attempt su-cide, but the morning after i wrote the note, i felt so guilty and disgusted at myself that i burned it. i feel so so guilty because these thoughts are absolutely terrible and i cant believe i would even THINK about these things. blaming someone for my su-cide? kind people wouldnt have these thoughts. why am i having these thoughts?? recently shes been talking to me less, im not sure why but its making me so depressed and su-cidal and i have been using everything in my power to fight off self h@rm urges. i dont know why im like this and i feel like such a bad person. i dont know how to stop these thoughts either. why does my mental wellbeing completely revolve around the way she treats me? why do i go into a panic/depressive episode the moment she treats me differently than she usually does? im so lost. i dont know why im like this.",valerie_s,Community Member,16-08-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/my-best-friend-triggers-my-self-harm/td-p/29300
Suic-881,Lost in this trap,"I am new to all of this but not new to this feeling. I keep thinking, I never signed up to any of this, I did not choose to be born. This life is full of what should be and guilt. It’s like no matter how much pushing you do, something will happen. From molestation, sexual assault, losing family, abusive partners, toxic work places. I continue to tick the boxes, I try to move on, my friends and family always comment on my strength to pursue past my cursed life because it’s abnormal the messed up things that happen out of my control. But it’s not strength, it’s all guilt. I cannot burden others with it, depression is a disease but it’s to the point my chest hurts, like there is no more air. I know all the tricks in the book to try and cope, but I’ve used them for years where they have weathered to no affect anymore. I feel like the only reason I am still here is purely from the guilt of hurting those I love. Suicide is almost a seductive fantasy because I don’t know how to escape the shadows of my past or avoid the ones of the future. I feel so selfish asking for help, but the facade is wearing through and the weakness others see in me feels humiliating at the same time. They usually see me with a smile and put together, but now it’s like I can’t sleep but I’m constantly tired, sometimes I can’t keep still or I just shake and someone witnessing it, I just can’t. Lockdown has just amplified everything and I live alone with no visitors. Usually I run to distractions, but even going down stairs to run laundry takes days of accumulating motivation. I know I am loved, I know how hurtful this is for anyone in my life to see, and that’s where it hurts the most because of the guilt, I’ve felt like this for years, over a decade and I’m so tired of pretending that not only I am okay but pretending that I ever wanted this life. I can’t answer when people ask me what I need because I feel like I need a pass to make it acceptable to choose it. I stop myself in every way I can, I make sure I have no plan, and I hold on to that guilt even if it is just threads.

Suic-882,I'm really tired.,"I used to have stage 4 depression a few years ago. I had a therapist as well and she said I had some sort of depression that would fester for a few weeks or months and then I'd feel fine for a long or short period of time. It's been a while since I've felt fine. It's probably the isolation but my anxiety and depression has gotten pretty bad. My coping mechanisms are even worse. I've been self-harming recently, a lot. I've developed a bit of an eating disorder cause I feel nicer when I feel hungry. I can't eat a lot, or at all. My mum's been giving me small portions for dinner and asks if I ate breakfast or lunch. She knows, i think, or she suspects. I've gotten used to lying to her for a long time, I've never really trusted her. It was only us for a long time and she wasn't okay when I was younger, she had ptsd but she's good now I guess, I don't think I trust her though. I had a panic attack a few nights ago on call with my friend cause I ate half a cookie and felt like throwing up. She didn't hear me cry, or she pretended not to, I'm glad. I also haven't slept well in a long, long time. As in go to bed at 12-4 in the morning and wake up at 6-8 in the morning type of stuff. I just can't get to sleep. I've been vaping a lot but I only indulge in that for the feeling. I've stopped before for months or years but it's not that addicting for me. I hadn't vaped in a long time but I got bored during quarantine and it helped the self-harming sometimes. Sometimes it made it worse. I'm not suicidal, promise, but I just like feeling in control when I spiral, feel too much or too little or when I want to feel the little rush when I self-harm. God it's a bad habit, I should really stop. Reading over this makes me see how depressed I really am, it's kind of sad though. I enjoyed this rant it felt kind of nice. But I really want to feel some comfort right now, a hug or a kiss or something to feel a little less lonely. Anyways I'm reaching the word limit so goodbye I guess. Anyone wanna guess what time I sleep tonight? No? Yes? I guess somewhere between 1-2am... We'll see.",lovely0711,Community Member,13-08-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-m-really-tired/td-p/30975

Suic-884,Feeling worthless and losing control,"Just saying a quick hello before I go on, I'm new to these forums hoping to become a part of this community. Basically I've felt myself really struggling with the effects of low self-esteem lately on me and feeling really worthless. I've always had fairly low self-esteem in relation to my image since I was really young but I used to at least be happy about my abilities and was overall fairly positive. This year however - and especially the past couple of months - I've habitually been excessively judgemental of myself and been practicing some unhealthy coping mechanisms. I've been constantly picking out all my flaws like saying to myself I'm ugly and that I'm no good at the sports I play and that no one prioritises their friendships with me because they don't care about me (because honestly that's what has been happening recently). Over the past couple of months I've been at a constant all time low where I don't seem to feel happy much and I'm constantly distracted by the fact that I feel terrible. It feels like I'm out of control and I hate the feeling, but I've discovered to regain control I distort my eating patterns to starve myself in the mornings up until after school where I can't handle it and I end up bingeing. It sickens me every day that I can't control myself in that way but I know I've gotten into a brutal cycle and it feels like it will only stop when I learn to have control over my eating, only to starve myself all day. I also started self harming about a month ago, but I stopped that about a week ago and even though its been tempting I'm so far resisting the urge. I've been regularly in contact with a counsellor from kids helpline over the past month and a half and its been helpful but I'm still struggling to find the worth in being resilient when I can't even find it in myself. I feel really down all the time and I'm tempted to just follow my emotionally unstable thoughts and not try to fix stuff because I'm on my own anyway (well that's what it feels like) but I'm at a dilemma in my head between giving up and me 'logically' knowing that I need to fix something. That being said, the fact that I understand that makes me seem like I've got myself sorted even though I don't and it puts me off seeking help further (in person). I want help but I feel like my problems aren't big enough and I'm scared of being judged even though I know it will be to the contrary but I really struggle to accept it when people actually say that I am deserving.",jumpyjellyfish-,Community Member,06-12-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,226,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/feeling-worthless-and-losing-control/td-p/532791

I’m in such disbelief what I go through every day (most days) with chronic suicidality and I can’t fathom that other people in the world out there are going through the same thing. are they? It feels so lonely that I find myself calling Lifeline just to tell somebody, because you can only really tell your friends sometimes. It’s not much of a conversation when every day you speak to them and you don’t want to be here. I’m wondering how others cope with the loneliness? It is truly one of the most painful things I’ve ever experienced in my life. I think because of not being able to speak openly about it with friends and family or in the public. It’s like I’m holding a secret in my head and it same time I’m trying to make good choices every day to keep myself here. At least if you’re illness is visible people know that you’re trying and suffering.

Suic-894,Depression Sucks,"Hi guys, This is my first post on here so I don't even know if anyone will come across my post. I am 23 year old single mum with a daughter who is 5 years old. I recently got Diagnosed with Depression back in 2020. Ive been taking medication for it since then and I feel my depression can be good for months & other times it is so bad that I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I cannot talk to my family and friends as I am a huge overthinker as well and I feel like if I am to tell them I am falling back into my dark place that they will think 'here we go again'. I have put them through hell the past two years and I don't want to worry them anymore than I have. I live in a small town and the two friends I have live 8 hours away from me & I feel that sometimes they just don't take my depression seriously or care as much as I wish they would. I would post that I'm feeling upset and they will see it and not even swipe to see if I'm okay, I know people have their own lives but I feel like sometimes I just have no-one to go to. Hence why I am posting on a page, I feel like I am more comfortable speaking to strangers about my depression then the people I know personally.

Suic-895,Life is for winners,"Sometimes it appears success comes easy. Other times you are sinking, watching the sharks circle. 30 years of uninterrupted water wearing away at the hull tends to beat you up slowly and surely until there's nothing left in the tank. The only thing that improves with age is the clarity to which you watch. It never gets easier, only increasingly more obvious to where the ship is heading. Holding on for the sake of family means over time that same family become objects of blame. ""If not for you this would be over"". ""If not for you I would be free"". It's unfair, but it's where the mind altered by depression and neglect takes you. I don't know why I've reached out here, but it seems significant. I'm fatigued, and it embarrasses and angers me to find me so weak, but it is no surprise. live your life and be happy if you have even a small part of your mind that still finds hope or joy or love... or SOMETHING.

Suic-896,what to do if person who saved your life no longer talks to you?,"Hello, roughly a year ago I attempted to take my own life, I was stopped only by a phone call from my best friend after I sent what I thought would be my last message. He literally saved my life and made me feel like I was supposed to be alive and that at least someone wanted me to stay. However after he went to uni, he hasn't contacted me much as he has been busy. recently I have had similar thoughts of hurting myself, and some very distressing thoughts about how if the person who told me I should be alive no longer talks to me, should I not be alive? it is very distressing and I'm not sure how to deal with it, currently, I am safe though I have had to use my safety plan a few times, however, these thoughts won't go away. I feel forgotten and unwanted, I don't know what to do. Another friend who supports me a lot is about to leave for uni too and I just feel alone and helpless without them. I am autistic so I don't make friends easily, they are the only two people I have ever felt cared about me and that I feel close to. I'm frightened of what may happen when they leave, they are the only two people in my safety plan I can talk to if I'm worried I may hurt myself... I want to talk to them about how I feel however I get worried about talking to them as I fumble my words and sometimes go mute when I get upset, I'm worried they won't understand what I'm trying to tell them and I don't want to bother them with such issues when they are both busy and doing exams. I just do not want to be forgotten about because I know what I might do to myself and it frightens me.

Suic-898,Last Resort Harm,"I hoped to not return to these forums. But I do believe I'm facing a serious problem that I wish to receive advice on. The nature of this post isn't positive in any means and may leave you feeling disturbed. I don't wish that upon anyone accidentally reading an excerpt while scrolling, so here's a warning that this post will contain thoughts and intent of self-harm, anxiety and depression and in general, me being paranoid as usual. I'm facing the possibility that I'm returning to self-harm as coping mechanism. I'll admit it, I haven't been clean for very long, being almost 2 weeks without acting upon my malicious thoughts. I self harm to stop myself from crying, to not make a fool of myself, to not panic, to not eat weird in public, to not to anything that draws attention. These first couple of weeks back at school have been an uppercut to my face. I've chosen my subjects for next year and started a new study regime in order to keep my place in english extension. I had to have a meeting with my math teacher due to the bold D-grade screaming in my face on my report card. Neither of these events had negative results, both were relatively neutral. But I felt a pounding ache in my throat and chest whenever the future was mentioned. The future where I'll be in ATAR working as hard as I could so I could go to university. But what if I'm not good enough, like I am now. What if even with my best efforts, with countless sleepless nights, overcoming my laziness and procrastination for my exams, it's still not acceptable. Something happened only yesterday that shocked me. Another one my friends, is grappling with suicidal thoughts. What. What do you mean I might have to report what she says? What do you mean she might do something she'll regret? I've dealt with these sorts of thoughts before, but now I'm not on the receiving end. What am I supposed to do? She doesn't really want to die, does she? I don't want to draw attention to myself, this isn't about me, but my urges are getting worse. I was on the verge of tears for an hour after I first heard about the situation.

Long story short I couldn't handle living like this anymore, I knew my family would be hurt but in time they would be ok. My daughter gave me a big cuddle and asked me if I was ok as she rubbed my back. I couldn't get words out. She then told me she will get me food to make me better.

Suic-900,How do I help her?,"My sister has been suffering severe depression and been in therapy/medicated for 17 years. She has attempted suicide more than once. Both of us suffer PTSD from very brutal violent and mental abusive childhood. She has survival guilt for having it 'less' violent and mental abuse than me. She asked me yesterday if I'd be angry with her if she was able to get euthanised. As much as it broke my heart I answered honestly that I'm pro euthanasia for intolerable suffering. Mental illness is as real as any other you can see on a scan. Of course I don't want her to do that - I want her to live. But she's only getting sicker and live only for her family and friends. I looked into it and she can't get euthanasia because of where she lives, Belgium and Holland require you to be a citizen and Switzerland is too expensive. I worry that once she realises that, it'll make her feel even worse. Then this morning she messaged (we live in on opposite side of earth) and asked: What do you think would be the big difference between receiving active euthanasia and ending your life yourself? Except with approved active euthanasia relatives could could possibly be present and that they get a chance to ay goodby. Why do I say to that? It sound like she’s looking for my ‘permission’ to end it. She doesn't dare to bring it up with her friends out of fear that they will have her committed. I'm really worried, more than usual.

But I'm 14 now and soon turning 15, it's been two weeks and I've done it nearly every day. It started when I was having a really bad mental breakdown and decided to do it. Something comforts me about it, I'm not entirely sure why I do it. The first time I did when I was crying like mad, I felt sick to my stomach and wanted to stop and I did. ALSO, I don't know if I'm doing it for attention. But I also think I'm doing it for a cry of help. BC I dont like talking about things, especially my opinions and feelings.

We communicated daily, she was always there for me and I for her. I am 41 years old, no kids. I am already on anti-depressants for depression/anxiety/PTSD. Resultant of earlier childhood trauma and teenage issues. I was mums carer for the last 18months since she was diagnosed with cancer. I spend my waking hours (which is a lot as I can only seem to manage sleep from about 5am to 9am), just being tremendously sad and crying and wishing she was here, or that I was with her. I have suicidal thoughts. However, I feel if I was going to commit suicide I would have already done it. I also feel that as I am a person who loves organising/planning things to the last detail that the fact I have a suicide plan all worked out is not that much of a risk indicator for me, as I love to plan many things even if I never do them (ex: holidays, house renovations). I guess what I am asking is, is my suicidal thoughts just a cry for help/attention or do I really think I could kill myself? I just don’t know how to live without my mum, life doesn’t seem right/good anymore without her in it.

What do I have to do to enjoy life? Hence the title for this thread how do you know if you’re at risk of suicide? If you feel you have nothing to live for and that you’d be better off dead than alive are you suicidal? I suppose because when truly suicidal you end it you don’t get to relive and learn from that experience because it’s over so how do you know what and when that feeling is? In terms of feeling safe yes right now I am safe.,Rupes79,Community Member,11-07-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/how-do-you-know-if-you-re-at-risk-of-suicide/td-p/4790

Then I get home and my mood has plunged through the floor and I feel like I want to act on my feelings of suicide. I attempted suicide a few years ago and spent some time in the hospital. Up until the start of this year I had a psychiatrist, psychologist and support group but I quit them all as I was doing ok. Still depressed but manageable. Since then I have had cancer twice and knocked myself out at work giving me concussion for 2 weeks and ongoing neck pain. I work as a casual but there has been no work for the last 2 weeks.

Suic-924,"What helps me/us/you survive, discussion welcome: Please DO REPLY.","G'day everyone - party hard and welcome to this thread, I hope you find something useful here, or share something useful too. 11.52 am 9/7/2021, I am safe, I've got shelter, warmth, food and water, friends and family and good dogs! But really I am not safe because if centrelink is ever to cut my benefits, I would rapidly become broke, unable to pay for food/water/shelter or medical expenses. So every time centrelink sends out one of their letters about request for information and informs me of consequences under social policy acts, they inadvertently threaten my very survival. So I snap to, and do exactly what they say I must do. I am centrelinks' slave to their paperwork. They think they're helping but really every communication from them to me is painful. I need their money, not their BS. So every once in a while, for whatever reason I find I am nearly unable to cope and I've got to stand up and say ""I can't do this any more"" and in my experience, the only language that centrelink understands and acts upon is expressions about ideation of suicide. And, nope I don't set about to make up my feelings regarding suicide, I seek to more clearly define them and share them with complete utter strangers who have no idea. Now I'll give advice to beyondblue. Every time bb send me a do-not-reply email, I absolutely hate that! Stop it! Feel free to contact me, but stop sending me do not reply emails. That's what centrelink does, it demands things, threatens things and says ""do not reply""! Do not reply is the poorest of communications. It is a power imbalance, do not reply intensifies isolation. Do not reply makes me feel violent! Damn that feeling. Damn that language. I remain safe, my wife is next to me, she's safe too. beyondblue is a good place, pretty much the only forum where I feel comfortable sharing these things online. Thanks for listening. So I ask others: What power or benefit can you gain from these unpleasant thoughts?

Suic-929,Is self-harm a selfish act? (T.W),"Hi, I'd like to say that first, this post recounts traumatic events and dark thoughts of mine. If you'd prefer not see that, please don't read this. Though a response is preferred, please don't think it's an obligation. I'd also like to say that at 12yo I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression. Every time that I'm found out hurting myself or expressing the will to do so, it's a selfish act, something done without thinking about the impact it'll have on other people. Now, my parents aren't harmful to me, they pulled me and my sister away from an abuser which is what first caused the thoughts years ago. But whether I tell my parents or they find out through their own means, I'm being selfish, not caring about the rest of the family and in some cases, a threat. By that, meaning that because I harm myself, I intend to harm others. This is not the case, no way in hell. Now, I'm not a saint. I've lied in the past, for my own benefit and for my abuser's, so it's understandable why my parents would jump to such conclusions. But no matter what I argue, I'm the selfish one. I harm myself due the bitter self-hatred that's buried itself in my heart. It's extremely difficult for me to accept compliments, if asked to point out positive things about myself, I can't. If I pass a test with flying colours, I'll often blame it on luck or a low class average. I've always had low self-esteem. But high school and the recent exams have proven to me more than ever, that I'm not good enough. That I'm not as amazing as some claim. ""They're just trying to make me feel better out of pity"" Statements like that strike me often. And combined with petty instances of public embarrassment, 'soft bullying' and general inconveniences, I break. I hyper-fixate on the errors, I scrutinise myself for messing up and do self-harm. Now this is mostly my fault here, but my parents don't know the full picture. I can't bring myself to tell them. I'm scared of past labels such as ""attention-seeker"" or ""overdramatic"" to come to light again. I don't have a therapist too. I have the school counselor, but they have to send me away for the day and to return with a GP's approval. I've called Kids Helpline a couple times, but this isn't working for me.

Suic-931,Triggers leading to ANGER leading to suicidal thoughts,"Hi all, It's been a scary week. This week I got very close to taking my life. I made a choice to call the helpline instead of taking my life at the time and they and my husband, together, got me through that night. Since then the suicidal thoughts have been plaguing my mind on and off and it's exhausting. There is a pattern. Things trigger me - something someone has said or written to me, or my daughter (and to a lesser degree my son's) behaviour, are the main ones (they both have special needs and get very loud). A small thing seems to trigger this feeling of absolute RAGE inside, which leads to the suicidal thoughts and takes me down a spiral of despair feeling like its all too hard, it isn't worth it anymore.. It's horrible and scary. Is there any way of stopping the rage over such trivial things? I really am scared I will hurt myself.

Suic-932,What can I do now?,"I've been struggling with depression for 6 years (since I was 12). I made a vow 6 years ago, that I would not live to see my 18th birthday, and that day is just 1 year away. I feel sad and tired all the time, I have no energy as getting out of the bed for school can take me over an hour on bad days. I don't eat properly, I skip lunch and breakfast nearly every day. I am also socially awkward, which is why I've always resorted to online forums as I mentally cannot speak to people about ""these"" things. I don't trust my parents, I keep everything from them. From a young age, I've always wanted to be a doctor, however the last few years have proved to me that I am incapable. I cannot focus on my work, and I have spoken about ADHD to my parents but was brushed off. My mum calls me autistic, and tells my younger sister to never end up the way I am. That said, I am a Mensan if that even means anything, so I know I'm not retarded. I have severe anxiety, which can act up at any time. This includes social anxiety, performance anxiety, situational anxiety and haphephobia. When I get panic attacks I feel suicidal. I feel like I could just impale myself on a fence. Sometimes I see, hear and feel things. One night I was in bed, my curtain was the translucent kind. It came suddenly, I felt something watching me yet I couldn't move to turn around, I was paralysed. I felt like I was going to die, and this thing was about to burst through my window at any moment. I doubt it was sleep paralysis, because I am certain I was awake. There was a time in primary school when someone told me the stories about Bloody Mary. For months afterwards, I was seeing her bloody face everywhere, especially at night when I felt like she was creeping up on me. I was afraid to go into a room alone in case she suddenly burst out of somewhere. Sometimes I can go into a trance, where I feel like a robot being controlled by another being. Feeling like I'm watching in third person. I haven't told anyone about these problems, apart from some online friends who I have no real contact with and are too far to reach me. I can't talk to people, physically and mentally can't. I know it's a problem. I don't talk to people because I know they'll try to help me, which makes me feel ""weak"" (my mum is the cause of this problem, but I can't change it now. Its ingrained into me). There is more I would like to write, but it won't fit. What can I do? I don't plan to live to work.

Like on the surface I am doing okay, I have a wonderful partner, we have a safe apartment, we can pay our bills and have 2 cats. But I dont have a job, im studying something that is really challenging and takes up a lot of my time. I cannot sleep at night but during the day I sleep so much (my class is in the evening 3 nights a week) and I just eat. I always feel unwell, whether it be a headache, period pain, some sort of neck or back pain, stomach issues or the onset of a cold. And if its not physical, something within my social life or whatever happens and it sends me back to bed. I have no motivation and I am stuck in a loop. Unfortunately I have run out of cash and cannot afford to see my psych/psychiatrist until I finish my course and get a job. I am about 5 homework assignments behind in my course and finding it really challenging. Tonight I had to leave my class early because my instructor started making jokes about strippers and I found it offensive. (I dont like humor that punches down) and the other people in my class said I didnt need to get offended. But i did. I feel that everything would be better if I didnt exist anymore. My partner wouldnt have to look after me when they come home from work and deal with the fact that I never clean and they wouldnt have to support me. I wouldnt have any money stress anymore. I feel like a burden on a LOT of people and constantly seeking validation from people. I always wonder what they would feel if I wasnt around anymore because they always make me feel awful, so in a way I want them to have guilt for not giving me what I want. I assure you that I am safe though, I have the thoughts but no action plan. I love my partner very much, but I feel like he could do better than me.

I feel like the GP is not listening. i told him about the issues with my medication, well that particular type. i have been on them for over 2 years, and they have done so much more harm than good. they made me psychotic in nature. they are awful. i wanted to do the right thing, and i had high hopes that medication may help.

I am the black sheep of the family due to being disabled. My father is an ableist bigot who is racist (I have a lot of Asian friends and every time I mention anything that could be remotely Asian he starts mocking the accent and the language (i have asked him to stop it hundreds of times but he doesn't)) and homo/transphobic which is completely against my views. He is controlling (I cannot bring anything into the house be it food, makeup, anything without being questioned like a criminal), tone-deaf, misogynistic and just awful. I am Autistic with ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder with Self Harming Tendencies, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD and have an eating disorder. Long story short, I am very messed up. I don't have in person friends and, as I've already said, I don't have family support.

What even can I do? Nothing. That's the answer. I can't do anything. I can't be sad because I get yelled at by my father.

Suic-938,No future,"Last year I had to go on Centrelink payments as all my work fell through due to Covid-19. Before then, I had put up with being chronically underemployed and constantly broke than deal with C'link's punitive, unhelpful brand of bs. Now I'm stuck in a small country town looking for 15 jobs a month (which will rise to 20 next month) where there aren't even 5 suitable jobs a month in this area that I could do. I have two volunteer jobs that I’m currently doing but as I’m under 55 this basically counts for nothing. I have a roof over my head at the moment, but the mental grind of doing this pointless Jobactive busywork, combined with constant job rejections, sleep issues, anxiety, Covid anxiety, depression, menopause symptoms and the realisation that I'm likely to be homeless in a decade is really making me wish that I wasn't here anymore. I explained all of this to my new doctor and all she did was stick me on a low dose of anti-depressants (which are affecting my memory and making me blank out in the middle of conversations – really handy when you’re in the middle of a job interview) and send me off to a community counsellor who provided little practical help. All the things that usually pull me out of a downward spiral are not working and I currently feel no hope for a future.",LL_is_Worn_Out,Community Member,24-06-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/no-future/td-p/17396

Suic-941,struggling,"so ive been struggling so much recently. i had this absolutely awful agitation in my head for about 2 weeks in april after on-going anxiety attacks and ocd symptoms. Ever since then its been a constant struggle with anxiety, panic attacks, derealisation, depersonalisation, brain fog and awful severe and chronic insomnia. Every day i feel weak and fatigued and im struggling with the unknown of the condition as to whether or not this is a mental or physical condition. I've always had strong health anxiety so im sure its the cause but its still so debilitating right now. It's gotten to the point where i'm seeking help from psychiatrists and psychologists every day and even frequently visiting the ER. Every night the symptoms are worse and the intrusive thoughts and agitation are unbearable, i simply can't stop them or distract myself from this. I'm getting some medication today for anxiety so hopefully that helps but im just really in a bad place and may even talk to my psychiatrist about inpatient treatment if it gets any worse. if anyone could recommend other methods of coping or any advice it would be greatly appreciated, because its getting very hard to cope and my intrusive thoughts have progressed to thoughts of suicide to relieve the pain from all of these symptoms.",seraphimpaige,Community Member,22-06-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/struggling/td-p/7494

Suic-943,Chronic ideation,"Hi, Hopefully I'm within guidelines, let me know if not! So I've always struggled with anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. The three things are almost like domino's, anxiety leading to depression to ideation, quite quickly. I finally had enough mid year and went to the GP and was put on SSRI. it helped a lot for months. Sadly, the crazy season tipped me over the edge and I feel hard. Interestingly, the warning sign for me is the prevalence of suicidal ideation that occurs. Those thoughts are always there (even when I'm relatively happy) but the thoughts are coming thick and fast now. I won't go into detail, but it is always the same mechanism of death, over and over and over. Last night I almost fell into old habits and called someone to stay using again (it has been a decade). The motivation for this was extremely scary, and holding back was hard. I woke up this morning again in a bad state (though better than yesterday). Does anyone have any advice on pushing through this? I don't want to feel like this anymore.

Suic-944,Want To Leave This Place,"Two nights ago I was dropped off at the hospital by my friend. I was having a very unhappy night (which has been a regular occurrence for months now). I had been at home by myself for three nights, and I was very distressed and lonely. I ended up drinking half a bottle of vodka... I also self-harmed. I ended up messaging my friend, telling her I wanted to go to the hospital. She got one of our friend's to come round and pick me up. When they arrived, I was lying down on the floor in the lounge room. My friend drove me to the hospital. After waiting for four hours, I needed to rush to the toilet, as I started feeling like I needed to throw up all of a sudden. I knelt over the toilet, needing to vomit, but nothing was coming out, and I couldn't regurgitate or anything.... so I sat down on the toilet, then after a few moments, I started to rapidly overheat. I was so hot that I started to quickly strip off my clothes (my two jumpers). I wanted to take my t-shirt and pants off too, because I was so hot, but I couldn't because I was in hospital. At this point, I was excessively sweating and felt really faint and dizzy. All of a sudden, I could feel this intense feeling, I could feel my ears losing their hearing (fading away), and it felt like my entire body and nervous system was fading away/about to shut down. Three nurses rushed in to help me... The exact same thing happened to me again after I was finally taken through into the hospital... After having blood test taken, I felt the same thing and started rapidly overheating, but this time it was 10 times more intense. I had to get back onto the floor and sit up against the wall. I felt so sick that I was making physical noises of pain and discomfort. Since that night, I have self harmed, and had urges to admit myself back into hospital.",Bee1998,Community Member,19-06-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,6,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/want-to-leave-this-place/td-p/22939

To be honest I have so much I want to achieve but terrible flash backs comes into my head when I try something new. Either ends being in the ED, ward or dropping out on the first day. I'm currently working but my hours has been drastically reduce. Part of the blame is me, so company is made these decision upon my safety and others. Looking for another to make more income and pay for my bills and but I'm a workaholic. If I don't work I'm my mood is constant battle. I don't have much going on right now. Currently my partner is away, its been a few months so everything has changed and its back to my old habits. He understand my conditions but I feel guilty because he doesn't deserve this or keep taking care of me. Needs to live his life and achieve his goals without me stopping. I'm absolutely grateful for the day we met till now. No one stay by my side because I know for the fact is was intense and scary for them. My first love now my ex bf his mom took him away from me because she didn't approve I was suffering from mental health. I understand she lost her son years ago, but I would never hurt him and I promised her and tried to prove to her I care for him with all my heart. The day I was released from the ward and came back from holiday he instantly broke up with him. He shattered my heart and I became depress and made bad decision. I spent in the ward for a month while he was on holiday. My family visited me everyday but I wasn't myself that time. Over the years I've posted disturbing post on social media so I can make people feel the my pain but it was pleasure for me. I know it's wrong but it made me happy. I know I'm an attention seeker , I know my moods are bad. I try to change but same time I don't want too. My older sister suffers from a disability so over the years I keep thinking what the future will hold. I know I scared my little sister over the years as she grows and watch me struggle. I'm trying to be a better role model. But I keep going back and up. I'm constantly feeling lonely, depress, weird, ok, happy. My thoughts are horrible and I start to laugh at it. I have 2 dogs their my best friends but sometimes I don't care at all. I know there's a lot that I'm saying here, but I just want myself back.

Suic-948,I feel so alone,"Not really sure how to write this or how to explain how I feel so I apologise in advance. I'm a 22 year old uni student who is struggling with some of the worst stress and anxiety I have ever experienced. I'm not a very emotional person, I have always struggled with my mental health and have had prior diagnoses of depression and social anxiety that I heavily internalise. But as of recent I just feel so helpless and alone, like I have hit my lowest, I can't sleep properly, I am not eating, and just don't feel like I want to be here any longer. I am not sure what's wrong with me, I struggle to maintain relationships with people which makes me feel so alone. I don't think I am a bad guy, I try my hardest for everyone who means anything to me and it just never feels good enough, I just want to feel like people care about me. I lack friendships or circles where I feel welcomed and I really wonder sometimes if people would even notice if one day I just disappeared. I have recently tried to seek help through the campus doctor and have booked myself into see a counsellor but I am just not sure talking is going to help. I could yell and feel like no one would hear me, I have overwhelming thoughts of suicide and feel like a prisoner in my own mind, trapped my by own self doubt and like nothing will ever work out. I worry about university, I worry about the people around me leaving me and I worry about being in this state forever, it's unbearable and I am kinda at the end of my rope. Recently I started seeing a girl at university and as much as I care about her I just don't feel it's going to work, we both care but the age gap for her (31) is too much and no matter how hard I try, no matter how much I care it just wont be enough and it eats me alive. I keep asking is it worth being so upset over this girl, but no matter what I can't get her off my mind. But I feel like this has been a major blow to any self esteem I had left, I care about her so much and once again it's just not good enough... I worry so much about my university marks in this bridging program and failing to achieve the degree I am after too.. I just can't focus, I try so hard to achieve the best I can and I feel like everything on my mind is stopping me from being the best I can be. If I don't make it then I think it might just be the final straw.

I hadn't seen him since we were 6, and now I can't ever see him apart from my nightmares. I hate him so much for doing this to me but at the same time I miss him so much and wish he would message me one day saying it was all just a joke. Just a horrible, twisted joke. I still lay awake at night, wondering whether it was my fault. I could have stopped him, or done something more to help him. I blame myself every day and I hate myself more and more for it. I don't know what to do any more and I don't know whether I'll make it to my graduation. The medications aren't working and I just want to die. I hate everything about me and I wish I was never born.

Suic-952,I dont want to be here,"I don't really know if what I'm feeling is actually an issue or if I'm just overdramatic but I feel the need to say something. Lately I've felt really useless and like a burden to my friends and family. I feel like no matter what I do, it's never enough and I can't motivate myself to do anything to fix myself. I keep getting frustrated and mad at my friends and family for such small things and I feel really bad about it but I can't seem to stop myself. I feel really burnt out, I know I've got school work to do but I can't do it, I feel constantly tired and it takes me ages to fall asleep because I keep thinking about how I'm such a bad person. I feel like a failure but as much as I try I can't seem to fix anything. I can't stop myself from feeling like everyone would be so much better off without me. I shouldn't be thinking this because I have a relatively good life and other people have had to go through so much worse than I have. Usually I feel completely fine in the day time when I'm around my friends, but when I'm alone I can't stop myself from thinking these thoughts again. I feel like I'm being dramatic but I also feel like I have a genuine issue? I've harmed myself a few times and immediately afterwards I feel like I have no right to have been doing those things - like I'm seeking attention but at the same time I feel like I deserve it, I deserve to be punished. It's pretty much a loop where I feel disgusted with myself and feel as if life isn't worth living, and then I feel guilty for thinking these things. Also, I feel like no matter what I do to try to change myself, no one's ever happy with me. It's a stupid way of thinking, I know that I'm overreacting and that no one hates me but I can't shake the feeling that I'm just useless. I just don't want to be here anymore.

Suic-953,I feel selfish for having self harm thoughts,"I’d probobly regret posting about this in the morning, but I just really needed to talk to someone, for someone to understand. I’m a 15yearold who struggles with depression and anxiety. I can not afford going to a medical professional nor does my family have the time to take me, they do not think it’s a great deal of an issue so I’m really stuck here with invalidating my own thoughts, and wondering if I’m doing this for attention or if it’s not a big deal. latley, I have been feeling like I can’t talk to anyone. All my friends have their own problems and I don’t want the burden of my nonsense to be on their plate aswell. Recently everytime I feel like I’ve failed or disappointed someone, I have an urge to harm my self. Ive struggled with self harm in the past when I was 12, I only did it once or twice. I do not know why. I haven’t told anyone about this and I haven’t told anyone about the constant build up of having the urge to do it again. am I bad person for wanting a break? All my friends do is tell me about their problems, and I love helping them I really do. I listen to them and I support them the way I can. For example my friend is struggling through the start of developing Ed. I went through something similar to what she is going through in the past, and still are. I listened and understood, I supported her and helped her. But I felt bad, for some reason I felt selfish for wanting her to ask if I’m okay. Because during these conversations I’d think about my self harm and intrusive thoughts. And recently she told me she wasn't doing well whilst we were on a call. And I felt like a failed. I felt like a horrible person and I felt like I couldn’t help her. everything piled up over and over again and my head started ringing. why do I feel selfish for wanting to be asked if I’m okay.

The main one is the biggest one-my Mum and brother are stopping me from selling my house as it’s in my mum’s name and she refuses to transfer it into mine. There’s a lot more to the story but I won’t get into it all, I’ll just say that this has been building up in me for so long and I’m now at breaking point. I have a 3 yr old daughter who I care for and I know she is a toddler and is tough to handle at times…it’s just that I wouldn’t find it so stressful trying to handle her if I wasn’t overshadowed by this horrible family thing hanging over me constantly. I’m finding it harder every day now to deal with the smaller general issues lately, eg only last week after leaving my phone on the bus I almost had a crippling anxiety attack which also brought on my asthma. I felt so terrified and scared that I may have lost my phone(I got it back tho). My psych has said my reaction is the sign of a very overly stressed girl who is drowning. I’m having trouble sleeping, I’ve gained a tonne of weight and this evening it has hit its low point, I’m just pacing around the house like a caged animal losing its mind…and all I can think of is that I’d be much happier just to be dead. And that has really scared me now bcos I have 2 gorgeous daughters who I cherish and in one moment I think about them but it quickly disappears and I just think I don’t want this anymore. I try convince myself they will be okay if I died. So it’s now I believe I should voluntarily check myself into a mental facility for a couple of days bcos the thoughts are not fading and I’m feeling more and more of wanting to give up.",Louise2072,Community Member,11-06-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/having-a-hard-time/td-p/15217

I think i subconsciously stopped because of my youngest daughter. A year ago i reached such a milestone..i was managing my depression well..and i met a nice man after over 3 years divorced. That ended a coulle months ago..because of me. I got sick..became insecure and witnessed not one but 2 deaths. One a police shooting..and then a horrific accident where a man died right infront of me. It lead to ptsd and my depression came back full force. My partner pulled away..he showed no affection or support..i guess he didn't know how to handle it. All this in under 9 months. Now I'm severely depressed and anxious and feel I'm not improving. Some days i do..but then i wake one day and just want to die. I am so lost. I feel everyone is sick of my problem. I isolate. And now my daughter has gone to see her dad for the weekend and i am feeling.extremely lonely and lost. I just wish it would stop.

I said I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and the counsellor ended the call ended after 11 minutes. I wish I never called. I think that's an awful way to treat another human being and I feel worse. I don't understand, who am I supposed to talk to? I told her things aren't working out with my therapist. She told me that I didn't connect with the therapist and that's what happens to people and to just find a new therapist and gave me a website. I expressed that I don't really have the resources for that. Then she ended the call, like that instantly fixes everything. I said oh dear this isn't good, and she continued to end the call. That is very dismissive. I don't understand. What am I supposed to do wait until I'm worse? I just wanted to talk to someone. Who can I talk to? I really regret making that phone call. I just want to get better. I thought the the helplines were supposed to be there for help I don't know what to do about how I am feeling. I don't understand why these scenarios keep popping in my head that I am gone. I don't want to die. I feel very alone and scared right now. I feel like everytime I reach out to another person for support it doesn't work and makes things worse. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to manage it on my own I'm trying to get better.

The next morning, I didn’t want to go to school, butmy mum made her go. At 10 a.m., my mum received a call from the school’s guidance counselor, who said I wasn’t doing well, and that she needed to get there right away. When she arrived, they spoke about how the idea of suicide had dominated me thoughts for three months. My mum and I went directly to the ER. That’s when she realized my issue was more than teenage angst it was a true mental health crisis. My mum felt scared and helpless. She wasn’t sure where to turn for additional care and treatment. Who should she call? A psychiatrist? Her pediatrician? A family therapist? Beth was lost.

Suic-964,I’m lost,"I’ve been on antidepressants since 2015 when I was 15 and the last 2 years- especially couple of months I’ve been struggling. I reached out for help to headspace last year but got lost in the system and never heard back from them, followed up and I was too anxious to go through the whole process again because it took a lot the first time. I finally got into the course I’ve been working towards since 2018 and I’m struggling with my mental health more than ever, for the first time in 2 years I relapsed on my self harm and everything’s just falling apart at once. I feel like giving up so much and I’m trying so dam hard not to, I feel like a failure. I switched to part time at tafe and the lecturer made me feel like I was just worthless and lazy when it’s not that, I’m trying so hard to hold on. I reached out to a gp for help and he just said it’s all in my head and barely helped when I was at my lowest 3 weeks ago- which caused me walking out ready to end everything. I was a mess but so lucky I had my partner there who took me back in and made someone see me due to the state I was in. My new gp seems to care and I feel somewhat comfortsbke with her, but I’m finding it so hard to open back up. my meds are being changed so I’m easing off them currently and I’m finding it so so hard, the migraines, my thoughts and emotions I’m struggling. I’m on a waiting list for a psychologist but I’m not even sure how long I can hold on for, I’m so tired of feeling this way. There’s so much going on, my friends don’t want us living where we are anymore and we have no one to live with as my parents aren’t stable due to alcohol abuse and mental illness and my partners lost his dad to suicide and his mum is heavily on drugs. So I’m lost for what to do, this on top of everything is just too much to handle and I feel so trapped. I don’t really know where this post is going but I had to let some of it out, keeping it all in is killing me and my chest feels so tight like I can’t breathe. I thought by this age it would all be a bit better, I’d maybe have some of my stuff together but it just seems to be getting worse and I’m trying so hard to get help but it just seems like I’m such a burden for needing it",SteamedHams,Community Member,08-06-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-m-lost/td-p/22494
Suic-965,"14 years of chronic pain, anxiety and depression: should I still have hope?","Hello, I have suffered anxiety, panic and crippling depression for most of my life. 14 years ago, chronic abdominal pain was added to the mix, which is particularly strong right now. I saw every specialist under the sun - including alternative therapies - and I had all tests done and I’m now on too many different meds that give me unbearable side effects. Five years into the chronic pain, I asked around on a free medical forum and two pain specialists, as well as a pain specialist I saw briefly, all said that if I had the pain for five years that it is unlikely that it will ever go away. I thought: why on earth would you tell someone that? Given the power of placebo and the power of the mind on pain, statements like that can well be self fulfilling! I still think about that often. Is this really true? Will I have this pain forever or is there still hope? Hope is everything? My questions are: • Is there still hope? • Are there new treatments I may not be aware of? • When my pain is really strong and I feel very down, especially at night, it would help to online chat with someone - I have diagnosed phone phobia - which I know Beyond Blue offers, but I need to tell the same story to a new person each time. Is it possible to ask for a particular person with a new chat? This may sound strange, and I don’t want anyone to freak out, but when the pain and sadness are really bad, I think about taking an overdose of something that would gently put me to sleep forever. I would never do that and I never made preparations for it, but the thought itself can give me peace. Like at SOME point, when I die, I will be released from this pain. If you have read this far, thank you for your interest in me and my story. If you know of any help out there that I may not have considered, I would be very grateful.",Franc_I,Community Member,25-05-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,8,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/14-years-of-chronic-pain-anxiety-and-depression-should-i-still/td-p/9917
Suic-966,Will the thoughts ever just go away? (TW),"I’m really lost, I haven’t been on this platform in a while and I don’t know what brought me back, I have started going to a psychiatrist since psychology didn’t work very well for me and they suggested prescription medication witch I refused, not because I don’t want to feel better but because I’d rather feel something sometimes then nothing at all, all the time. I still have to take some medication that’s useless and isn’t helping though, I still cannot talk to people. Along with other stuff I’ve also been diagnosed with ASD stage 1 which I kind of understand as she said there is a link between this and eating disorders but I’m still unsure. My parents know I’m still self harming now, I couldn’t tell them but I managed a nod when my mum asked. I feel very lonely, and being lonely is quite a very painful thing. When I first became depressed I never had suicidal intentions or thoughts but now after everything is supposedly going to get better I can’t stop but wanting to die sometimes. Everything I feel, feels wrong, and I feel that everything I do and everything I am will never be good enough for this world, for myself. I want to dig a hole and just lay there for a while until I slowly decompose into nature. I know I’m not a normal kid but sometimes I can act like one, it’s becoming less and less but sometimes I feel okay. But there are other times like now where I can’t help but wonder what my life could have been if I didn’t waste it in my head. I have struggles talking about feelings in person due to anxiety and my ASD but I do have a way with words and music but they don’t always feel like my own. My mum is going to tell my psychiatrist about my self harming and I’m afraid not because I’m scared of her knowing but because I’m afraid that I’ll have to talk about it and when I say I don’t how I feel I can just hear people telling me back “I think you do know” but I don’t and I don’t think I ever will. I’m afraid that if people find out I’m still so sad, worse then before then I’ll make them sad and depressed too, I’m a burden, but I wish I could be a good child, I good friend, sibling. Everything is so stressful and scary I relapse I flush my food down the toilet or throw it in the bin and if people know they’ll be sad, so I hide, I hide it so very deep till I can hardly remember it’s there, but it is, and it won’t go away.

Suic-967,Confused at my thoughts,"Hi, I am new to these forums and just wanted to ask a question which has been troubling me. Some background: I am 17 and currently feeling pretty lonely, lost and not like me. I started uni this year and haven’t adjusted very well. I do most of uni online because it takes me three hours to get there and back, which has made the experience very lonely. My main social interaction is with my sporting club, but because of my mental health I haven’t been able to train and perform consistently to the standard I want to be at. I am currently in exam week and am finding it hard to get the energy to study. This is making me more worried, because I am not getting the appropriate preparation completed for my exams. To get to the point of the post: For the past couple of months I have been having thoughts and visual images about hurting myself, which I feel are increasing in frequency. Sometimes when I am really down, it is like a mantra going on in my head. I know that I wouldn’t actually act on these thoughts because there are things that I still want to achieve in my life, but it scares me that the thoughts are still there. What I mean to ask, is there actually something wrong, or am I still “just fine” because I know I will not act on these thoughts? I don't want to ask for help if there isn't actually anything wrong going on and I am just over reacting. I have tried talking to my parents but they just dismissed these thoughts because nothing serious has happened to me. As a side note, I just wanted to mention that I am safe.",Butterfly100m,Community Member,05-06-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/confused-at-my-thoughts/td-p/5525

I get scared thinking of where I might end up if something doesn't change soon but I can't see a way out of this headspace I am in. Recently, it has been getting to the point where I start to think about suicide nearly every day. It isn't that I want to die and the thought really scares me but I honestly wouldn't be mad if I died. Is this normal? I think I might be going crazy. These thoughts used to be fleeting but now I am thinking out it more and thinking about how and where I would do it. I think about if I want to do to kill me or just to hurt me badly enough so that I can go into hospital so that my life can slow down for a while. I just want everything to stop.

Suic-971,What will my therapist do if I tell the truth?,"My mental health has been at an all time low. Between my mental illness, and just life circumstances I'm thinking about suicide every night. I'm exhausted because I can't sleep. When I do sleep I sleep all day because I don't see the reason to get out of bed. I catch myself planning out in meticulous detail how I would do things to inconvenience the least amount of people possible. Honestly? If it were not for one very specific thing I would already be dead. My family lost my aunt to suicide last year. It tore us to pieces. My mother is never going go recover from this, I know it. And because of this, I know if I were to follow in my aunt's footsteps, it would destroy her. And there is nobody in this life I love more than my mother. So I feel stuck in an untennable situation. Living is excruciating, but I can't die because I can't do that to my mother. But I'm not sure how long I can go on the way things are. I have a therapist, but we're relatively new together. We've only had three sessions. I think I need to tell her how bad things are for me right now, because how is else can she help if she doesn't know? But I'm terrified of what might happen. If I tell her the truth - that I'm thinking of suicide every day, but will not go through with it for my mother's sake - is she obligated to do anything? Report me anywhere??? I don't want the situation to be taken out of my hands, if that makes sense.

Suic-972,Possessed/Compulsive Disorder?,"I’m new here, I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this? I feel like I'm possessed by spirits. It all started about 5 years ago, when things started to go wrong in my life and long term partners. My partner got a disease that can’t be cured and I hurt my lower and upper back at work, loosing my job after two years of rehab and not getting better. Around that same time, my only friend who I had so much in common with, took his life without much warning, other than telling me he thought he was possessed and saw a Catholic priest, then felt better. Due to our conditions, our sex life was put on hold, so I turned to porn for a short term support. As things were not sort term, I came to depend on porn, which became an addiction. My partner moved to another room to sleep, because we where keeping each other awake. My partner told me last year that she can no longer have sex with me ever again due to her illness. My addiction then turned into an obsession and started to take over other areas in my life, where all the things I enjoyed doing were replaced. Now I have given myself over to it completely, it controls me, I can’t say no, I can’t help myself, i’m now compelled, driven. Every day I spend at the lest 8 hours, at the most 17 hours in a 24 hour period watching porn, I can’t stop and it is increasing. My mind has been re-programmed through my eyes, this happened before the possession stage. I now cry a lot, don’t leave the house unless I have to, I’m isolated, I feel helpless, I have no friends, no Job, on depression and anxiety meds and think about suicide weekly. A year ago I started smoking cannabis and now between that and porn, is really all I do each day. My music taste, personality and looks have changed, I’m sad all the time and see no way out of my situation at all. I see my sexual behaviour increasing. My partner says I call out sometimes at night in a language she can’t understand, my dreams are all sexual. I have started going to strip clubs and a prostitute once this year, I have been looking for fetish clubs, swingers groups, nudist groups, online sex, webcams, can’t help it. I feel so lonely all the time and wish I had other people to talk to who can relate to what I’m going through.

Suic-973,Trigger warning- Confusing feelings,"Hello there I'm just feeling a little confused at the moment working through many thoughts and feelings and wanted to hear some thoughts and opinions. Before I start, I just want to say that I'm safe. I'm seeing a counsellor tomorrow, I've spoken to a crisis team last week and a friend is holding on to anything that might be unsafe for me. I've been flicking between suicidal feelings for awhile now, some days are good and some days not so. On the good days, I feel that I don't want to cause pain to my friends and family, and that no explanation will really be enough. On the bad days, I feel really bad about myself - I feel like i'm just really weak being like this. I feel tired fighting these thoughts, and I'm scared that even if I get through this now, these feelings will come back somewhere later in life. These thoughts do make me want to end it all, but I don't. Just want to throw it out there again that I'm safe. Is it normal to have these conflicting feelings of wanting to end it, and wanting to push through and stay?? I feel tired after talking to my counsellor or crisis team, and I feel anxious thinking about having to speak with them or anybody who asks me if I'm okay. I feel the need to reassure people that I'm okay, even if I'm not. I find it difficult to ask for help, or to talk about how I am feeling. Is this normal? I've been struggling with self-harm too, but I feel the need to lie to my counsellor/friend that I have been self-harm-free even if I haven't. I'm not sure why, if it's shame/guilt or the need to pretend to be okay. I'm a little bit worried of what might happen too - is there a chance I might be placed into a mental health facility if that's what it's called? I'm really tired of feeling this way, I feel pretty messed up and rough about myself. I'm not sure if I will ever be my usual self again. Right now I'm just trying really hard to be present and stick around. Thanks in advance.

I am lucky, I am an essential worker so I still get to feel productive and see people in my work, but I can't get over this feeling of loneliness and despair. My ex husband left me a few years ago, and I live on my own. I have never had another partner other than him, and I don't think I ever will - I am not a fun, outgoing, interactive person and I don't have any positive qualities I could bring to a relationship. I also don't have the energy to navigate online dating (which seems to be the only way to meet people these days.) I asked my two best friends to be my single social bubble buddies, and they both refused. I understand their reasons for refusing, but it still hurts. I also suffer from a chronic pain condition, which I have been told will never get better. Every day it seems like I struggle more and more just to get on with the everyday tasks I need to do and there is never going to be an end to it. I feel like all I am is a function; that while I am useful, I am not somebody who would be missed if I am gone. All I want is for there to be no pain, peace and a feeling that I am important to someone, but I cannot see this ever happening.

Suic-976,officially estranged from my narcissistic aunt and grandmother,"I had not spoken with my grandmother in about two-and-a-half weeks after she had deliberately called me overweight. She called me overweight, after I told her that ""life should be enjoyed, not endured,"" which was in response to the pair of us discussing my diet and exercise. I decided to visit her today with the assumption that my father made for me to ponder over, that she wanted me to reconcile with her. I rang the doorbell to find that she was not impressed to see me at all. I thought that maybe visiting her and trying to talk with her about the fact that she called me overweight had affected me negatively, but instead she deflected the situation onto me and played the victim, which is typical behaviour from her. Her claim is that I am abusive to her although when I confronted her about that she was unable to provide any evidence of me behaving in such a way. I also just wanted an apology for her calling me overweight and for the fact that she abused me over the phone at the beginning of last year. I got cross with her after she dismissed my feelings because I was hurt by how condescending she was towards me. She told either my mother or father that if we attend her house again she will put restraining orders against my mother and I, even though the pair of us have done nothing wrong and nothing to her. My grandmother has also threatened to get a Maori woman in out family to beat up my mum and I. My mother is depressed because she is nearly fifty and all she wants in life now is peace. But she cannot understand as to why she is consistently being dragged into family problems that she has nothing to do with. I am glad that my grandmother does not want anything to do with my mother and I because we think she is negative. My father is stuck because he loves his mother but he also loves my mother and I. He does not want his mother to think poorly of him, which is understandable. My mother is speaking with a psychologist once a fortnight but in spite of this her and my father refuse to seek proper psychological assistance for themselves. I have suggested Susan to mum but she is not interested and does not seem to care about us improving our relationship. She is codependent on my father, unfortunately. This makes life especially hard for me. As you can probably imagine, I am feeling suicidal.

Suic-978,Heartbreak and my BPD,"Hi everyone. I’m looking for a bit of advice at the moment because I’m currently struggling with quite a bad breakup and it’s left me absolutely devastated and heartbroken and I just don’t know how I’m going to be able to move forwards from this. It’s been nearly three months and even though I was doing really well for almost two months- eating healthy, making sure I got enough sleep and exercising 5 time a week which is something I didn’t do throughout the whole relationship- I seem to have fallen back into a slump and am back to eating bad, going to sleep at stupidly late hours and barley getting out of the house let alone exercising. On top of this I just feel hopeless, I struggle with BPD which has made things even more of a mess because my moods are constantly changing from numb to sad to angry and it’s exhausting. Ontop of this Melbourne is back in lockdown so I won’t be working for a week (hopefully this lockdown dosen’t last any longer) but it’s only been one day and I honestly don’t know if I will cope a full week of doing nothing but being stuck by myself with my own thoughts. Unfortunately tonight I actually self-harmed for the first time in well over a year because I was so desperate to try and calm myself down. I just feel so horrible because I was so so in love with this person and this breakup was so out of the blue that I don’t know what to do with myself. we had been living together for almost a year and now we don’t speak at all and he refuses to meet up with me to talk to me which is all I want because I feel like I have had no closure and even though I have spent hours trying to figure out what went wrong I don’t know and it’s killing me.

I always feel really bad asking for help, like I'm guilty of being lazy or irresponsible, but then I remind myself that we all feel that way sometimes and I wouldn't think that of someone else who felt so sad and alone and was struggling. I don't really know what to do, but the last few days I've been waking up with no energy and staring at the ceiling. I've had suicidal thoughts before, all throughout life, and even going so far as to physically hurt myself because I thought it was the only way to ""punish"" myself for being so inadequate. I don't do that anymore and I'm in a much better place overall in life, yet these thoughts still intrude every once in a while and it sets me spinning. I suppose it's because a part of me wants to give up and is terrified of being hurt, or hurting someone else. I'm terrified of intimacy. I'm scared of new relationships, but I'm doing my best to fight through that assumption that everything will be terrible, and have recently been going out and meeting new people and am trying to find clubs in my area so I can branch out further. It's just... it's really scary. Some days I don't want to do anything. I'm sorry this post is so confused. I'm really confused too. I just want to keep doing my best, because I know there are lots of others out there struggling against that feeling every day.

I wake up every day full of anxiety/panic and I want to kill myself. A parent committed suicide when I was growing up, and at various low points in life, I've considered suicide. I'm in my 40s and a well-educated professional. But several years ago, my first wife left me. I feel into a deep depression that significantly impacted my work performance (despite therapy and meds). I also remarried into an unhealthy relationship. And I was binge drinking on weekends/holidays. A few years ago, I was fired from my job of many years and my second wife left me. I guess I hit the F-it button and survived a couple years exhausting my savings. Once I ran out of money, I thought I would just kill myself. The primary thing that's held me back is the pain it would cause the few family members I have left. In the past couple years, I've taken some positive steps and am trying to start working again. I'm also living a healthier lifestyle and drink infrequently. But I'm unemployed, in debt, alone, full of regret and my professional confidence is shot. Hence, waking up in anxiety/panic and wanting to just end my own suffering. I just don't know if I have the emotional energy to pull myself out of this hole. So if you've had similar thoughts, know you're not alone.

Suic-986,"Been dealing with Depression and self-harm, but am really struggling.","Hi my name is Juliet. I've known for a while that I've been depressed, I just always feel sad and tired and am over everything. That's why I started self-harming, luckily I got out of that phase and started to feel okay again. But since my life is messed up I'm now scared I'm going to start falling back into it. No one really knows about what's been happening, as I haven't talked to any person, my friends etc don't see the signs as I know I'm pretty good at hiding it. The thing that helped me get out of my 'slump' was my cat. He always listened and It's like he knew when I wanted to self-harm because he'd come up and nudge me and distract me. He made me so happy and even though he is was my younger sister's, he helped me so much, he was like a support cat if anything. Two weeks ago he was in an accident and went into cardiac arrest during surgery. I miss him so much and I feel like without him I'm not going to be able to distract myself. I can't pinpoint where the sadness that just hangs over me for the last few months comes from but it's just always there and my cat just helped let the sun peek through sometimes. So now I'm getting self-harm thoughts again and I'm scared because he won't be there to help. My parents don't understand shit and they just yell at me when I do bad at school, and they're relatively good parents but there are just some aspects when it comes to my mental health that they don't understand. For example, they think having a phone is going to make me end my life but It helps me distract myself and I always feel comforted knowing that if I have a breakdown or I hurt myself badly that I can get help. Now they've decided to lock my phone up at night and I'm scared I wont be able to get help. I'm sorry but I don't really know what I wanted to get out of this, I just needed somewhere to talk to people. Has anyone got any tips about any of the things mentioned???",ImaStayAnonymous,Community Member,23-05-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/been-dealing-with-depression-and-self-harm-but-am-really/td-p/2982
Suic-987,Why it becomes a real option,"Don't know why I'm writing this. I just wanted to say that after a suicide attempt in my 20s I am really thinking about it again now in my 50s and basically it boils down to the fact that I have tried for so many years with different therapists, medications, biofeedback, (even venting on BB) and in the end none of it has helped me. I know some people get results from therapy and meds and thats great for them but I think I am far from being alone in finding zero benefit from the thousands of dollars and draining discussions I have had over nearly 2 decades of treatment. I keep looking up local psychologists and wondering if it is worth trying again but I just do not believe there is any point because I have tried so many times before. When your life is getting up early because of chronic pain and/or worry, doing a job that has some good points but plenty of stress, then coming home to my empty flat and empty life that has never ever included love, intimacy or companionship, eat food, watch crap TV then try to go to sleep if my anxiety would just let me and then have the usual array of unpleasant and nightmarish dreams, only to do it all again next day and forever.... well, then the ugly option of suicide starts to look perfectly rational. As I said, I'm not in danger right now but I am so anxious and angry at several issues in my life right now and when I feel like I want to seek help but have nothing but resentful feelings towards the system that has failed to help me in the past I just stop trying and feel stuck again. I have spent my entire life in a miserable rut and my head is so locked up and broken that I just don't believe I can escape it. I just hate myself so much and cannot stand being in my own skin. I hope I never kill myself but I guess at least my complete inability to allow anyone close enough to love me means I won't really end up upsetting too many people. Apologies for the wallowing self pity. I can't sleep so this is what I end up doing. What a stupid pointless thing to do.

Suic-988,Serious Question,Hello everyone. I am a first time poster. My anxiety has been building for months now and my medication does not seem to be working and the past week I have had the overwhelming urge to self harm which happened last night I have not done this for maybe 6yrs! when I did the act it wasnt the pain that eased my anxiety but the end result i.e. seeing the harm. My question is this: Is this why people harm themselves? is it the pain or the end result which eases your anxiety? I remember a Psychologist telling me that it was the pain that usually eased the anxiety. Would love to hear your thoughts.

Suic-989,The inVISIBLE illness,"My hands are shaking and my chest is tying itself into a knot - I'm not sure if this is because I'm in yet another episode or I feel like a shift is coming being welcomed in to this world. A world I thought I was alone in. It's tragically beautiful - seeing so many likeminded souls. I don't know why I have always been so apprehensive of this sort of thing. (forums/groups etc). I have a wonderful supportive fiancé, a dachshund and an Irish wolfhound, an amazing (slightly dysfunctional) family. I am caring, loving, a good listener and very positive, friendly person in my social world. I am currently at the end stage of building a first home with my partner in a beautiful neighbourhood. I have suffered depression since the age of 12. A car accident that damaged my shoulder, leaving me with chronic pain and migraines and PTSD. Anxiety was new at 22. Drug and Alcohol abuse at it's peak at 25. Diagnosis of ME/CFS (Chronic fatigue syndrome) and IBS at 27. I am freshly 28. I'm in a depressive/CFS episode - who knows, sometimes i cannot distinguish the two. I haven't worked in two years - unable to control my physical and mental health long enough to keep a job. Before I left my job of 6 years, I attempted my life. I have been hospitalised 3 times for this. Once last year, once in 2018 and once at 16. I am an incredibly lucky soul to have not been successful in these attempts. This reminds me to add this to my gratitude list later. I regularly see my GP, Psychologist and Psychiatrist but outside of this i try to manage a very unsuccessful routine of sleeping well, meditation, yoga, eating well and journalling. This comes crashing down in an episode and becomes too heartbreaking to start the process again. But i will. Because that is this weird and wonderful journey we have been given, isn't it? I am struggling coming to terms with this not so 'invisible' illness. Coming to terms with having this for the rest of my life. Lacking quality of life it feels like. Worrying if I'll be well enough to work again, have a child, be part of a friends group. Do you ever get like that? Frankie the dashie is looking at me like I am the centre of his Universe.

As I was growing up, I coulda sworn I was driven and determined and wanted to succeed in life. Then I got 2020'd as did most, but prior to that, since 2017, I had really been struggling. And I wasn't alone. I shared these struggles with my closest, best friend of a girlfriend. She eventually became the mother to my current 3 month old son. Now, I'm not sure if post-natal depression is playing some big role in all of this, but what I had in mind going into all of this, for months and months, was that I would be a loving, nurturing dad 24/7 for my son. Instead, I live trapped in this rather ridiculous situation where I must visit my son as though he were like a library check-out system or as though I were visiting someone in prison. While I am not directly blaming the mother for these issues, I cannot deny that it is rough for me, personally. I am really not dealing with this situation well and it is badly effecting me in more ways than one. Currently I am in debt to Centrelink, because apparently they paid me too much? Idk how that's my fault/problem? On top of that, my bank is in the negative and I've missed 3 weeks of work due to basically everything feeling completely overwhelming and bullshit and unfair and my god why should I even bother posting this...

Even at work, it feels like I don't deserve the money I receive. Every morning I wake up wishing I was dead. When I look in the mirror I want to smash it. I hate that ugly person looking back at me. I hate everything about my appearance and who I am. The only time I feel okay is when I'm living vicariously through others. I socialise to distract myself. The second I'm alone it all comes back. I wonder why people even put up with me. Is it out of pity? Is it because they don't know any better? Half the time I'm counting down how soon it'll be before they finally realise how worthless I am and leave me. Sometimes I wish they would. That way it'd be easier for me to off myself. And no one knows this is how I feel. I keep up a happy façade and act like I'm okay. I'm too scared to tell anyone how I actually feel, I don't want them to leave me. I tried telling my mum - she told me I was ungrateful, an attention seeker. A loser. She said I'm unfixable and it's pointless trying to get better.

Suic-994,Should I tell my partner that I relapsed?,"Hi, First time posting here because I need some advice.... Last night I went out with my partner (together 3 yrs) and all his friends and I really embarrassed myself and embarrassed my partner. I got a little too drunk and was acting weird and my partner told me that I ruined the atmosphere a little. I used to self harm around 7 years ago and sought treatment and am in a much much better headspace. Very rarely though, my emotions become really overwhelming and I lose control of myself and my thoughts and forget about all the progress I've made. About a year ago this happened and I relapsed (this only happened once) and I felt so guilty and ashamed that I told my partner a random excuse for the scratches and he believed me. After reflecting on behaviour last night and receiving a phone call from my partner who was concerned, I spiralled because I felt extremely embarrassed and mortified for disappointing him. I just want to say that he didn't try and make me feel this way and never has before, he just wanted to know if something was wrong that caused me to act in that way. I ended up hurting myself again (not seriously) because I lost control of my emotions and in the moment felt like I needed a release. I have no plans of doing this again and deeply regret doing it. I just want to know if I should come clean to my partner. I know he will be deeply upset and I don't want to make things weird or awkward. I do want to tell him because I do want some comfort and support but I just feel like it will come across like I am gaslighting him and trying to make him feel like he made me do this by confronting me about my behaviour. I would feel so guilty coming across this way and this would make me feel even worse. I also don't want him to be scared to confront me if I make mistakes in the future, for fear of causing me to relapse. Should I wait a few days or tell him in a little while while the situation isn't so fresh? Or should I just not tell him at all like last time. It worked out best last time because we were able to move past it and I didn't upset him. I'm also scared that he just wont understand and might take it really badly, like an insult. I feel so ashamed and guilty and can't think straight. I don't live with him so he can't see that I feel like this.

I am 50 years old and about 4 years ago got myself diagnosed with Asperger's, because I always knew I was 'different'. I am married (thank god for the internet), but I have no friends and am unable to maintain or initiate any form of decent conversation. Most people think I'm weird and just give up. I don't talk very much and can't use the phone. I also have a stutter, which doesn't help with the phone thing. All these depression help places have 24 hour phone lines, but I can't use the phone, and the chats don't start until later, so here I am. Just over a year ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety - I see bad things happening ALL the time. I don't see a man standing at a corner, waiting to cross the street, I see a man in danger. I see my wife falling down our stairs, my kids tripping over a t-shirt and hurting themselves. Always pain and death. I have multiple panic attacks all day, every day. I went to the psychiatrist because my wife made me - they wanted me on drugs and CBT, but I countered that by never going back to my GP or talking about it again ... I can't talk about it, I just want it to go away. I got a letter 4 weeks ago telling me to go to jury duty .. I can't be in a room full of strangers .. I can't go to the city (last time I went was with my wife and I had a panic attack) .. I won't take public transport... and I'm being forced to do all this stuff. I thought the easiest way out of it was to harm myself, but my wife organised a phone appt with a GP, who told me because it had been more than 12 months since she had seen me she couldn't do anything and told me it was my civic duty. I felt really humiliated. I had to turn up to jury duty on monday - my brother drove me in... was dishcarged and told to come in again on tuesday and was discharged again until thursday where I will get assigned to a trial. Every time they go through the ballot its like being in front of a firing squad .. 4 times and each time I feel like I'm going to die. I can't go to court .. these are all criminal cases - I steer away from this sort of stuff - I watch cartoons and try to think of other things.

Suic-998,I don’t see a future for myself,"Hi, I’m currently 18 and graduated high school last year. Early in my senior year I started to have severe panic attacks and became depressed as i reported to my teacher that my brother sexually assaulted me growing up. This was a clear memory that I’d always had but until I got older I did not know that what he had done was not normal or not okay because I trusted him. My mum also knew and didn’t tell anyone or do anything, but he only did it once. After I reported it I had to tell my dad (live with only dad, parents separated) and it was horrible because I hate seeing him upset. Since then it’s progressively got worse and I attempted suicide 3 weeks ago. This may sound silly but I feel embarrassed that it didn’t work because I hate attention and the thought of being an attention seeker. But since then, I think about dying every day. I’m just constantly exhausted and It’s not that I can’t do it anymore, it’s that I don’t want to. I have no interest in growing old, and I have the view that we literally die anyway and life makes no difference because in 100 or 1000 years no one will remember you or the earth will be dead so what’s the point.

Suic-999,I Don't Know What to do or Think Anymore,"I am new here. I am female, 26 and a university graduate, as well as a TAFE graduate. Since the beginning of 2020 my mental health has spiraled. I have always suffered from anxiety, and was diagnosed with GAD as a teenager. However, it wasn't until Feb 2020 (about two weeks after my 25th birthday no less) that I finally got diagnosed with Autism (and major depression). I have never been good at forming or maintaining relationships. During my adolescence I had no frame of reference for why everything social was so hard. I was severely bullied to the point I had virtually no friends until my last two years of school. I keep in contact with 2 of them, my third closest friend I met at uni. At present all 3 hardly speak to me, I go months at a time without hearing from them, if that. My family is completely torn on both sides. Legal drama on my fathers' side has ruined my relationships with my two cousins there, my grandparents on his side are both diseased; a strong feud on my mothers' side has basically completely cut my mother and I off from my cousins and auntie. I am in contact with my Grandad, but our relationship is very superficial and we never have more than smalltalk. I live with my nan and I am very close to her, but she is so much older that she has a hard time helping me and she shouldn't have to at this point. I am an only child so I have no siblings to turn to. Both my parents suffer from anxiety and depression themselves (they have both been clinically diagnosed, so I was destined to be the same, really). Since the pandemic hit, I have felt completely isolated. I have been forgotten by friends and family alike. Nobody contacts me, and that is not for lack of me making an effort - I used to, but slowly stopped because the responses I got were always curt or otherwise the conversation just stops because they have more important things to focus on. I am unemployed, I was trying to find work just before the pandemic hit but that stopped any traction I might have gained and because of my disability I doubt I will ever hold a job (I have never worked previously). I have never been in a romantic relationship and nobody has ever expressed any interest in me in that way. I have no one to turn to, no one that cares. The voices in my head telling me to end it are getting louder and more frequent. I have thought of ways, but I have never attempted because I have a phobia of death. It is probably the only warring part of my mind that is stopping me.",Amberstar,Community Member,11-05-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-don-t-know-what-to-do-or-think-anymore/td-p/30706

Suic-1001,"WA is choked, and i'm giving up.","there's a lack of psychiatrists, therapists.. all mental health care work here. just getting a test to confirm something already diagnosed took 3 months to get into, and i've at least got the privelage of going private even if it was expensive. i feel so so bad for them, i feel useless and like a waste of their time and i don't blame them for the situation they're in, please don't take my frustration as anger at them. appts for my psychiatrist take 2 months every time. she's so busy, she can't even brush up on my details before i come in.please don't suggest 'get a new one', i've been through this song and dance three times, and many more with therapists. my therapists' clinic isn't returning calls. she's the only person experienced with adhd i've found in my area after 3 years of searching, and the only person to point out that my adhd is the root of the anxiety and depression and directly work on that with me instead of disregarding me when i said i wanted to work on my adhd, because that's not in their wheelhouse. i've been clinging on for so long, and forcing myself to work. two years ago i finally broke and quit and came to terms with how bad my working memory and speed of processing. (literally below 4% of the population on these tests i just had came in. glad to have evidence at least.) i think the worst part of it is that my constant failure in the working world put my self worth to nothing. i've had to apply for disability over covid, i pay utilities and if i want to be seen in under four months i have to pay for that too, and they denied it because my medication has changed recently. i need it in writing that my condition isn't going to significantly improve in the next 24 months, and my psychiatrist doesn't want to pull the trigger on that without further diagnostic work that takes MONTHS to get to, and treatment that's months apart and i end up having to have rehashed to me over and over because no amount of trying to write it down actually makes the memory stick!! i'm so overwhelmed, and i'm so glad i'm living with my mum because i'd be dead by now if i wasn't, but i feel backed into a corner by all this and i was about to do something stupid to myself last night just to try to escape it. it's a constant thought in my head and i'm getting worse at convincing myself it's worth hanging on for. please help me.",possumm,Community Member,10-05-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/wa-is-choked-and-i-m-giving-up/td-p/7436

Suic-1005,"Everything, including myself, is too much. *TW*","*TW - suicidal thoughts* I am a usually happy person who has been struggling for the last 12mon. I am about to graduate medical school and have my final exams soon which is a source of stress. I also have one of my final clinicals finish just prior to exams. The clinicals are long hours, all day, every day and overnight for three weeks. After 12 months of this and exams, I am not coping well. Compounding this my partner of 6 years (lived with for 4 years) had planned to propose after I graduate. During a discussion about it recently he reacted poorly saying I was putting pressure on him and that I was ‘too much’. I find it hard to ask for things in this relationship due to the financial disparity. I have been studying for 6 years. I have worked during this to support myself and contribute. I do most of the housework. I try to make everything perfect considering the long hours he works. He makes good money working for a large company in management. I would like to specialise in a niche field. We love where we currently live so I took a job close so that I could prioritise us, and possibly having a baby in the next few years. This job isn’t as fulfilling as if we moved but I made the decision that I’ve been studying for so long that I wanted to have a family and put that first. He also acted extremely negatively towards having a family soon. He said that he’s too pressured to support just us and he needs me to work full time for years before we consider that. I feel I’ve been auditioning to be his wife for years and he’s pushing the decision back. Since the discussion he hasn’t mentioned it at all. Meanwhile I’m slowly crumbling under the pressure of study, work, being unable to ask for things in the relationship, watching other people get engaged, have babies, the prospect of working in a less fulfilling job without having a family to be worth it I deleted social media because I couldn’t stand it. I’m restless, I cry all the time. I had an appointment with a psych but cancelled it because I had to wait 6 weeks and I can’t book ahead with uni. I think about writing suicide notes and harming myself. I don’t have anyone I can talk to, they all have their own issues. I just don’t have the strength to do anything right now and I have no idea how I’m going to pass finals when I can’t even watch a half an hour TV show without fiddling, and self-harming I’m losing it.

This is my story. in 2016, i was in grade 6. there was an incident at the school which resulted in a school lockdown of around 5-6 hours. We had no food because our lunches where in another building. A lot of kids were crying and passing out including me. Eventually we were escorted out and taken to get our bags from our classroom and go into the junior building were they had labelled the classrooms in alphabetical order and if you had siblings. i found my little sister who was in year 2 who was 7 at the time. We were in such a large room and it was so terrifying. After my mum had picked us up she took us home and let and behold there was a huge fire across from my house. Ever since then i developed ocd and anxiety when i was 11-12 in 2016. My anxiety has always been with me since. it wasn’t as bad in year 7 but i still had to see a school counsellor. Year 8 at the end is where it all went down hill i stopped eating and developed an eating disorder and became anorexic. I gained the weight back and i hate myself so much now like looking back on the photos i was so pretty and skinny. Year 9 in 2019 is when i developed panic disorder and i would have constant panic attacks at school and home and i would have to get picked up from school constantly and leave class. People would judge me and tell me i was faking. my panic attacks would be so bad i sat in the coordinators office and wouldn’t catch the bus home. My lips would vibrate and i would be dizzy and nearly pass out. I eventually stopped going to school and just never went back. i went into modeling for a shoot and it was okay but they said to come back when i had matured. Throughout 2019-2020 i tried a specialist school for anxiety after not being at school for like 5 months. that’s where i met my ex boyfriend i wasn’t at the school for long. i then tried online school and it was good at the start and then i wanted to go to normal school but now that i’m back at normal school i hate it.",Izzy_P_5,Community Member,26-04-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/asking-for-help-when-i-m-suicidal-and-telling-me-to-just-calm/td-p/2609

He told me he hasn’t been feeling himself for the past few months and he doesn’t know what’s wrong with him, that we need to break up because we’re just too different emotionally. My mum picked me up last night because he didn’t trust me to drive home by myselfand I am COMPLETELY heartbroken and confused. I just don’t understand how he can give up on us so easily. My partner lost a parent a few years ago which he told me he never got counsellling for, which is making me think that he has underlining issues he needs to sort out. Is our relationship really over or does he just need space? Did I scare him?? Please help me make some sort of sense out of this. Can someone please help me make sense of all of this???

Suic-1012,Hello! New and dunno what to do T_T,"Hi everyone, I'm Mitch and I'm 24 🙇‍ I've been struggling with depression and anxiety among other things since I was 18. I think I might've been suffering since my early teens but did not get diagnosed until we moved to Australia because my home country treated mental illness as taboo... I've been medicated for it since 2014 and saw a psychiatrist for only a year. (I was not making any progress with her and could not afford to see another one) I have gotten better over the years, I was even able to complete a Cert III and Diploma in TAFE! I know it sounds silly but it's a feat that I thought was impossible for me since I have untreated ADHD, I couldn't even finish Yr 12. Anyway a month ago, I was able to land my first ever job as a casual waitress. I was a little nervous but overjoyed since I've been struggling to get a job which is understandable, nobody wants to hire a 24 y/o who has zero work experience (though I have been volunteering in an op shop on weekends) My problem is my depression is worsening again after starting my new job. I start crying and throwing up a day before my shift even starts because I dread it so much. I do still report in, it's just I get so anxious to the point I can't do much else but lie in my room until work. The job itself isn't too difficult, I can keep up with the physical demands and I don't mind getting criticism, but it's hard when the manager always looks at you like they want you dead. When I say hi/goodbye/thank you, they don't even bother to look at me. My co-workers are a little nicer but it's still clear that they don't want me there. I've even considered injuring myself so I can't come to work. I want to quit so bad but I feel that I'm overreacting, that this is something everyone goes through when they start their first job and I can't complain because I brought this on myself. I've been applying everywhere but have yet to get an offer so I'm starting to fall back into the mindset that I just wasn't meant for this world. I do have parents who love me and provide for me but I don't want them to spend the rest of their lives worrying about me. I do have friends but none of them close enough that I can share these thoughts comfortably. That's why I decided to share on this forum so I at least have an outlet for my worries.

Suic-1014,The impulse just becomes more frequent and more serious,"this post ended up basically just being a collection of things i wanted to vent about, sorry I used to only think about suicide maybe once a month or so, and it was very hypothetical. Over the last few months-year it's become much more of a thing in my mind, and recently I've had a few days planning to attempt it until it fell off later on. I don't know what's wrong with me but I'm just, generally not happy. My mood goes up and down a fair bit, but has become more consistently down over time. I don't enjoy much, everything feels like a huge, draining effort, and I'm just incapable of a lot of things anyway. I've been neglecting hygiene a lot more, I rarely end up showering more than once a week, though I guess that's normal for me. I've been overeating a lot, just because I have poor self control and it feels good, though I hate that I'm getting even fatter now. I was prescribed taking srri's for a bit, stopped taking them recently, I don't think I noticed any change. I've been referred to a psychiatrist over this and the possibility of ADHD, though the earliest I can see them is April. I don't know what I'm going to do once school starts again, I do absolutely nothing in class and have had declining grades and been failing more recently, I don't know how I'm supposed to be able to complete my assignments or major works when all I can bring myself to do is sit there and stare. I worry about how I'm meant to have any kind of future, I feel worthless, lazy and useless as a person, and worry a lot about wasting time and all the things I've missed out on already, and get jealous of other people's lives and qualities. I spend a lot of time just trying to get attention with my appearance or whatever online, though I can't post in the space I do that anymore so I guess that's over. this post kinda ended up just being a collection of things i wanted to vent about and wasn't really about anything I guess, sorry. probably forgot a bunch of stuff too.",Mirai,Community Member,16-01-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/the-impulse-just-becomes-more-frequent-and-more-serious/td-p/520480
Suic-1015,Not sure on the best path forward,"The older I get the more back story there is for anything to make sense and I don't like talking about myself at the best of times. It's been 15 years since I attempted suicide, 12 since I last self harmed. Since then I've gotten married and have a 1 year old now, so I don't want to be getting worse, I need to provide for my family. If I thought I could get away with it I would probably have fallen back into my old self harm habits. If I was going to kill myself I'd do my best to make it look like an accident, to be clear, I think it's very unlikely, but it's also at the forefront of my thoughts and the fact that I don't think it's an option makes me feel even more trapped. I saw a psychologist 6 years ago and was diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, that helped in a lot of ways, but made things harder in other ways. I'm more self aware about things, but that makes me realise that I am just incapable of passing for normal, no matter how hard I try. It was tough making that first step to see a professional and I'm not sure if I could do it again, maybe in the world of telehealth I would fare a little better though. What scares me the most is being hospitalised, apart from the obvious reasons, I've worked at the local hospital for 5 years now, I know everyone from security quite well, I've been in the mental health department to fix and upgrade a number of systems in recent years and I do my best to portray myself as a professional and keep myself in one piece. My anxiety went through the roof when I first had to work in the mental health department, although it actually seemed like a nice and safe space to be in as a patient, having a connection with so many people at the hospital terrifies me. I did try and talk to someone on online support yesterday, I just didn't know what to say, I don't know what I'm trying to do and it seems there are few options for people who struggle with talking face to face.

The gp put me on antidepressants. I tried antidepressants for 10months however I developed severe anxiety and for the first time in my life depression while I was on the medication. I tried several types of AD. When I decided to stop I seen a gp who said just stop. I of course suffered withdrawal syndrome and it was very severe to the point where I had become suicidal also had ocd intrusive thoughts. 1 year since on since stopping AD I have been back to myself and who I was before I ever started them I have however developed a huge fear of the word suicide. Even just reading about it sends fear into me and dark memories as it reminds me of that dark place and the depression and ocd intrusive thoughts I went through. It makes me believe I would go there mentally again even if I dont want to. it has impacted my life where I am scared to have a second child due to the thought of it triggering depression, ocd intrusive thoughts and suicidal thoughts on its own as now I might be prone to it. Does anyone have any experience or know if medicine induced depression, ocd and suicidal thoughts can cause me to go down that path again if I was to have a second baby? Without taking AD this time Does anyone have any sort of simular experience or can shed any light on my situation. Really want another baby but scared of suicidal thoughts and intrusive OCD returning.

I have a couple of health issues, and what seems like more and more personal problems every day. I finally broke down in my gp's office and asked for for help , he was very nice but told me he's not a psychiatrist and that's who l need to talk to and gave me some contact numbers , that was 3 weeks ago and l still haven't the courage to contact anyone. I have turned to a few family members and friends only to be told to hang in there . I'm not sure what l need or what l'm looking for here, but lm getting desperate for help that l'm scared to ask for .. I spend more days locked in my bedroom than l turn up for work, even knowing it will soon cause me to lose my job..

Suic-1021,"The inner pain that is killing and destroying me, and the life I never deserved","I am literally one of the saddest person you have ever come across. I had literally endured loneliness, bullying (school, social media, in public, etc.), trauma from unhappy experiences, no partner and friends, other mental illnesses (autism, OCD, schizophrenia) ...all signs of a mundane and miserable life. I even attempted suicide twice but failed, and literally cried at night in bed sometimes. I hardly talk, lack trust and shy away from outside people. I feel like no one cares or hated (by majority of the public). I could hardly get what I desperately want in life. I had no motivation, courage, hope or drive to do things, am withdrawn to my recluse life. Why me? Why must I suffer? I deserve better like everyone else, why must it be this way? Never have I ever got respect, appreciation or empathy from outside people. Depression to them is such nonsense. They either shut you down or berate you. They are never a call or text away like they normally promise. Words of comfort are nothing if they can't be there when you desperately need them to. Guess I'll disappear, it will only afterwards then they realise they need to start putting in more efforts and take it with more priorities.

Suic-1022,Suicidal thoughts and Self harm.,"Hi, I don’t know where to start from. I still remember i first tried SH when I was maybe 7th grade? Everyone expected too much and i was not able to cope. Self-harming. Mom thought it was accident. I stayed quite. Self isolated from everyone after the incident. No one questioned. We moved to a different city then life was back to normal for everyone. I cried quietly everyday, no friends unless its a closest family friend. I can still count my friends in my hand. I pretended to be happy and fast forward 10 years later. My life wasn’t bed of roses but i was surviving with minimal nightmares. Then, i got legally married to a stranger whom i met 3 days before the date of marriage. He treated me well I wasn’t thinking straight my family loves him. I got pregnant, he asked me to abort , I agreed without asking further questions. I cried every night, i have nightmares but he is too busy to notice. Last year I tried again after staying clean for 10 years. Attempted suicide three times but i woke after 8-10 years like i was sleeping. No one noticed. I’m clean for nearly 10 months now. But suddenly i get strong urges, i still feel the pain, nightmares?, chills. my confidence has gone down hill since then. I get flashbacks every now and then. I shared with friend who asked me to seek help but then i lashed out at her. Idk why. I don’t know what I want to do i just want this pain go away.",April4321,Community Member,23-04-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/td-p/28621
Suic-1023,Dont know what to do,A bit about me I have suffered pain every day since 1997.after 7 spine surgeries it has come to this .I have to live with nerve pain and a left leg that no longer works properly. I have 2 daughters and 2 step daughters which all love me but I have reached a point that I'm just done with this life. Is it so bad to just want to be pain free and have a positive way forward. But I've exhausted all avenues and feel that I just want it to end. The last surgery's 3 over a month ended up with a complete lumbar fusion that has not only made things worse but now I cant work.

Suic-1024,Gday Everyone *Trigger warning: history of a suicide attempt*,"Try #2 at posting... Gday all My name is Scotty, and I've been diagnosed bipolar for about 15 years. I had another 15 years of experience with the mental health profession before that, but was mis-diagnosed with unipolar depression, mis-medicated and mis-treated for that period. I've had 6 psych ward stays over the last 30 years, two suicide attempts, and an unbelievable run of dickhead pdocs and other mental health professionals trying to understand and assist me None of them have been useful, apart from prescribing me the standard med regimes. I'm here because I'm struggling again with wanting to stay alive, and because the best help I've ever received throughout the course of my illness has been from other people who have the same disorder. Where mental health professionals don't understand shit, other patients do, can empathize and understand, and give good advice. I've come here for help. I hope that you guys can steer me through this difficult time that I'm not managing well on my own. If you've got this far, thank you for reading.

Suic-1025,Seeking connection,"Hi there, so I'm very nervous about posting. I guess my story is that I have been experiencing multiple mental health conditions for over 20 years (I'm 38 and have depression, GAD, social anxiety, eating disorder, C PTSD). During the day I work and wear a mask and pretend that everything is great, and after work I go back to depression land. I'm lonely, bored, tired, hate my life, and have suicidal thoughts but know I won't act on them. I'm on meds, have a psychiatrist and psychologist, have had a few psychiatric hospital admissions, but nothing changes. Going to sleep is the best part of my day. I feel like I'm grateful for my privaledge and the things I have in life, and I do little things like journaling sometimes. I guess I'm just putting this out there to be heard and to connect with other people who are experiencing something similar.

Suic-1026,Occurring Suicidal thoughts,"Hi everybody, I have been experiencing suicidal thoughts for quite a while now. I have started to self harm and I cant stop. I am lacking sleep and I am feeling upset or down often, about different things. I don't know how to stop the pain I'm feeling. I often find myself thinking about what my friends and peers life would be like without me, and feeling like nobody likes me. I also find myself thinking about death. My life honestly isn't the greatest right now and it hasn't been for a while. I don't feel like there's anybody I can talk to about my suicidal feelings, as I tried talking to a friend and they ignored me, and when I tried talking to a family member they refused to believe it. I feel like nobody likes me, and there's no need for me in this world.

Suic-1028,Today is not a good day.,"I'm not sure where things will fit, and I apologise in advance for any confusion I bring. In spite of my efforts to be clear, I confuse. Everything feels like an overreach, that I have fumbled into better position than I deserve or earn. Sidestepped hardships by accident and fallen onto my feet at a run ahead of the starters gun. Lauded for crossing the finish line first when I didn't even know I was in the race. Somehow even with all my luck, I am never enough for the things I strive for. Position, promotion, purpose, pointless. My arms shorten as raise them, fingers fail to fold around and grip, eluding. Everything I am is a dice roll in someone else's game. The days are easier when I can accept I am less. Watching things unfold and filling minor supporting roles that create no risk of drama seems where I am most apt. My ego rises and I have to remember to punch it down. Jam my fist in my mouth and keep my head bowed. Rally against myself as the common enemy til I am numbed by the bruises and left in the corner.

The people around me will miss my wallet and money, but sadly I feel the will not miss me. My second wife saw me looking at some porn on the internet and she reckons she must be married a pervert. When she gets a idea in her head there is no moving it, so I will be a pervert for the rest of my life. She told me a few days ago that being with me makes her want to vomit. She is my world and my only friend. Her first husband also committed suicide and I think I now finally understand. I don't think anyone could live up to her standards. I got a referral from my GP to see a psychiatrist, I call every psychiatrist in Brisbane, none would see me because they don't work with people like me. I called every day to New Farm clinic and Toowong clinic for weeks, but nothing. All psychiatrists are full and most don't ""take on"" older patients. I was told by one receptionist that if I had tried suicide and failed then she could get me an emergency appointment. I asked, what if I tried and don't fail. She didn't answer and just suggested I phone someone else. When you get past a certain age, you become invisible and no long valued by society. I can't go through another divorce at my age and I am just pulling everyone down with me. I am just tied of living, of the battle, of the disappointments.

Suic-1047,A somewhat Positive Achievement,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to share a somewhat important milestone for myself. A few days ago I went to a GP to get a mental health plan done. This was huge for me as I have a fear of doctors and feel like I don't deserve help. While I experienced some of the highest anxiety levels in my life leading up and on the day of my GP visit it went relatively ok. The GP I saw was respectful and understanding of mental health which is rare within the medical field. Also just a random question but has anyone done the dass 21 assessment? How did u find it? I think as a mental health assessment it isn't too bad. The plan for myself is to start the process to go to a headspace clinic. This is inevitably going to be a long process as the wait times are always long (I have been to headspace before when I was younger). While this is not their fault as they do their best while fighting a difficult battle, it is hard knowing I will have to continue to fight my battle alone for a while longer.

(It is not the flu itself, but the insanity and response from Governments worldwide that has really destroyed my ability to care about living anymore), the new Australia many in power talk about, new rules, vaccination passports, tracking etc and possible forced vaccinations, or at least coerced, no jab=no job etc has killed off the last bit of what I used to believe what Australia was and my place in it. I don’t even know why I’m writing this as I’ve lost all faith in humanity... the one thing really stopping me from going through with it is my parents, especially my mum, as I know it would really destroy her (she’s in her 70’s and in a weird way, it comforts me to think I may not have to wait long).

Lately,I’ve been feeling like there are so many things going on all at once, and I’m getting tired and overwhelmed. Sometimes I feel like I’m not appreciated. I feel that there’s a constant need for me to please people around me, for me to be accepted. I always feel like I have to say yes all the time to doing people favours so I will be loved or liked. And these feelings are just really exhausting, so sometimes I wish unto my self and I thought of it as being luck, if anything was to happen to me then lucky, I won’t have to deal with everything else anymore. I hate feeling this way, I always think of my son and my family whom I support whenever I find myself in a bad place.

My gp says she has created a care plan, but apartfrom the phone number to the psychologist I know nothing else about it. I find myself lonely in a way i have never experienced before, when i wake Up i just find myself wishing i could stay or go back to sleep.

Suic-1056,I was getting better but now I'm getting much worse,"I have depression, anxiety and social anxiety (unsure if those last 2 fall under the same category) I've been on antidepressants since August and I felt like I was getting a lot better. I was really excited to start uni this semester because I was moving to a different uni and changing my degree to something I enjoyed. Around the beginning of this year I started seeing a new psychologist (my third one so far) and I felt it wasn't really helping that much but I stayed with it. I thought about stopping and now it just so happens I can't see her anymore because she only works on Tuesdays and I'm at uni 9-5 on that day. So I haven't been to see her for just over a month now but I feel that if I went back it wouldn't help much anyway. Recently at uni my symptoms have been coming back slowly but quite steadily. I enter panic mode in classes where I don't know anyone, I doze off in lectures even though I sleep way more than I should, I'm losing focus on things I enjoy and those darker thoughts are happening more and more often. In the past when I was in a bad way I would have passing thoughts about killing myself but recently I not only think about it more often but I'm imagining ways I could actually do it. There are days where I'm really happy to just enjoy life but then there are days like these where I feel like I'm losing my mind and I don't know what to do about it. Mind you I've told my psychiatrist about this and how therapy isn't helping me and his thoughts were that I was too intelligent for therapy (his words not mine) and that he could either give me medication or I could try something called mindfulness. I chose to try mindfulness and it works sometimes but I'm so far gone at this point that my attention span for it has just gone out the window.",orangejuicewithpulp,Community Member,17-03-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-was-getting-better-but-now-i-m-getting-much-worse/td-p/517739

I am seeing a psychologist who has been a major help but I am ashamed to tell her this.

The thoughts of harm are creeping back, I'm paranoid, overwhelmed, exhausted. In a most bizarre situation yesterday, a Manager of a drive-through store took it upon herself to verbally abuse me. There has been a bit of an ongoing minor saga over something petty - my store 'membership' number. I'd been putting it down to her having a bad time, struggling with something, etc - I don't know. Until yesterday when she went off! I've never been rude to her but she doesn't believe me that the app doesn't work on my phone. So I don't handle confrontation well and now my brain is telling me I need to harm myself - I haven't harmed myself in over 6 years but now I'm feeling on the edge. I hate that she is stuck in my head and they am doubting my own character - having lived through domestic violence, the confrontation has triggered the self-doubt and self-flagellation. Why do I always come back her?!

He is only three years old the emotional pain of being separated from him is unbearable. I managed to visit him just as COVID hit. During our time together he accidentally scratched my eye and I developed a condition called recurrent corneal erosion syndrome. It is an extremely painful condition and it ruined my life. I couldn't sleep I was in just constant physical pain on top of the emotional pain. I dealt with everything alone being separated from family and friends. That I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I couldn't work out why I felt sick all the time, and was on so much medication for pain and mental health it literally was destroying me. Then I turned to alcohol as a way to cope and that just made everything worse. I start to feel better going to all these psych appointments but i self sabotage everytime. I'm sick and tired of constantly battling. I tried failed my suicide attempt you would think that would be a wake up call and try to get my life back on track.

Suic-1061,"26 year old and life filled with regrets, want to quit university","Hi, A bit about myself. I started out studying environmental science at university, did that for five years. I haven't made any friends since high school because of long term social anxiety and depression. I finished my Master of Environmental Science and spent a year looking for jobs with no success, so I spent most of the time working for my parents' business. Over that time I forgot almost everything I knew and I had no notes to fall back on. I eventually decided to take up a bachelor of business (accounting) and I'm in the second semester of my second year. Halfway through last semester I lost any and all interest in my subjects but I pushed through it because my parents said I would be wasting all that time if I quit then. So here I am back at uni and I feel no motivation, no energy and without the ability to study for more than 30 minutes without checking my phone or anything else just to take my mind off study. I have a work placement year starting next semester for which I will soon need start applying for and working on my resume, interviews, etc. I just hate myself for making so many stupid decisions and I just want to quit everything because the anxiety and depression is overwhelming. I have no passion for what I'm doing, I've lost interest in my hobbies and I feel like I'm only living for the sake of it. Even if I wanted to see a psychologist, the wait times are at least a month for every place I've called, many of which don't even do face to face appointments anymore. I feel I won't be able to survive that long with every day bringing non-stop stress to me thinking about assignments, tests, and my future, day and night. I wish I could keep working for my parents business and help them out that way, but the future prospects aren't looking good. Looks like I'm just going to have to live with doing a course I don't care about at all and I'm struggling to remember the material for because my memory has gotten so bad, or I try to change my study to something else and live with the guilt of having wasted 8 years of my life going nowhere.

Suic-1062,Several hospitalisation questions,"Two part post, one part relating to past experiences and the second about possible future options. A few years ago I attempted suicide in what one GP called a ""near miss."" I had intended to jump off a bridge but at the last second called my boyfriend for help. I've had several attempts before this one as well. After this attempt three years ago I got basically no help. I had two GPs at the same clinic who I had been seeing regularly, who were both supposed to be really good doctors and who I would see based on their availability. At the time I wasn't seeing a psychologist because mine had just retired and these two GPs just... Didn't have any recommendations for me to refer to, which was how I found all my previous ones. My question here is, why wasn't I hospitalised? I think I remember saying I didn't want to go to hospital because I'd heard some pretty scathing reviews about the mental health services in our area, but at that point I was stuck in that 24/7 suicidal mindset. I had a plan, and and attempt. I was terrified to be left alone. I don't understand why nothing was done. My second question is about how to know when to take yourself to hospital, and how that even works. Do you have to pay to go to a psych ward? I've been researching inpatient programs since the earlier incident and all of them require payment or private health insurance. Are there differences between emergency hospitals and non-emergency ones? How do you know when to check yourself in? Do they expect you to have a plan, or is just thinking a lot about hurting yourself enough? I feel like I'm stuck in this situation where I'm functional enough to survive each day, but over the past three years my mental health has deteriorated so far I feel like I can't do anything about it. I've seen counsellors and psychologists since then, but due to just a long series of unfortunate circumstances I haven't been able to see one for more than three months before the leave or the funding for their program got cut, or any other number of things. I've been referred and on a wait list for a private clinical psychologist my new, much better GP recommended for about a year, but apparently that wait list still has a few months left to go. I know this is a bit of a wall of text, so thank you for reading all the way to the end.

My last score was a 27. I shared that I had no suicidal thoughts or any thoughts of self harm. I was feeling normal again. I left my appointment feeling positive and hopeful. And then today, I endured one negative experience that triggered something horrible. It brought back all of the feelings of worthlessness and loneliness. It brought back the thoughts of life without me and I don’t know how to face tomorrow in this state. I don’t know how to face my psychologist because I’m afraid he will be tired of me.

Suic-1066,*Trigger - self harm* I suffer from anxiety and depression and struggle living out in the world myself and since i have started to wory about my gf ,So my anxiety and depression keep me inside most of the time and usually that's only effected myself as I cannot live my life something I'm sure many of you are familiar with however lately my gf has been going out with freinds and she has a history of being sexually assualted so I'm very weary. When were out I steer clear of most men unless we know them and I don't let her follow random people on social media. I also don't allow her to post certain photos that may be a tiny bit on the strange side or anything that shows off her body which causes fights since she has her own mental struggles such as body dysmorpphia and claims she's just trying to be confident in herself. In the most recent incident it has driven me to self harm since the feeling that I can't do what's right for her and I can't be what she wants me to be and I irritate her and I am far too controlling and she deserves better. Which further continued the arguement since she hates when I self-harm and leaves me feeling more worthless.

Suic-1071,Feels like im drowning,"Today is hard, i am roughly 6 months pregnant and unemployed, my partner and i have been struggling for months to find jobs and have made the tough decision to move from Forster back to Sydney area. though we have more support and family down here its was not our first choice in options but we both realised that it is what is best for our children. Since getting pregnant i have struggled with many problems and issues from family drama from both sides to my step daughters birth mother drama. i feel like im barely hanging on these days and the urge to self harm or worse is getting stronger everyday. My partner and i have been struggling financially, as he is in alot of debt, and my insomnia has kicked back in to where i am barely sleeping most nights.

Suic-1075,What's wrong with me?,"For as long as I can remember I have been quiet, I'm now 23 (turning 24 this year), have no friends, never been in a relationship or even kissed a girl. I have finished uni and struggling to find work, mostly because every time there is a question that asks for 'skills' I write in 'idiot' before promptly deleting it and replacing it with meaningless things like 'cash handling' or 'customer service'; not much to do with the graduate position i'm applying for but I have too much self doubt to write anything else, or rather I think I do (I may also just not have anything else). Recently I started a new casual job and went to the pub with some co-workers (I only went because the workplace was shouting the dinner); normally I would just stay at home ( I did a few times). Like with my previous job they seamed fine to talk to women they met there and a few took them home, I don't know if its just me, but I feel as though its morally wrong to talk to women in public like that, that been said, I also feel like a pervert and sexual if ever I am attracted to any woman. Given the character limit here are a few other things I do as dot points: Talk shit to myself in the mirror ever day (how much I hate myself). I have no real friends, we have all gone our separate ways, the one person I kind of talk to trys to avoid me, but I cling on just so I am not alone. I am really annoying to talk to, I keep making dad jokes and it really drives people away after a while (as in literally all I say are dad jokes, I cant make conversation). I spend my whole day playing single player PC games. I can only talk to people if I have a few drinks in me, if I have a (1) 'friend' I know well and no one else around I can normally talk to them. While I was at uni I had no friends there, I literally just went to class and straight back home. I really cant handle social situations and often hide in the toilet. At every stage in my life I though to myself, now it will be different, I will make some friends or get in a relationship, here at highschool/moving out/uni/first job/second job ect. I studied a spud arts course that I know wont get me a job. I'm not very attractive and people often find my voice irritating. I would never harm myself, but I wish I was dead. +more All in all my dream is to one day own a home and have a family, but I really don't see those as actually possible anymore the way I am.

Suic-1076,Same old feelings,"Hi All, Im a newbie here and thought that this maybe a good outlet. Lately i've been struggling with suicidal thoughts or self harm. Like right now i want to have some physical pain instead of numbness, hopelessness, being unfulfilled and all the other negative feelings. Having some physical pain i know how to heal it or stop it from hurting, these other feelings i have no idea how to do it. However, i will not do it, because 1. i don't want to clean the mess when i come too. 2. I can't afford to pay for damages on the property. The upside of lazy i guess. I have seen a couple of psychologist and feel that the help they try and provide does not work from me - they have diagnosed me with a few mental illnesses (which is helpful). Also, been feeling to damaged too help. The struggle is to find the best one to work with, within a budget and timeframe. Also monthly visits calls builds up my anxiety and then too have it cancelled or postpone just makes me feel even more damaged more rejected. Asking for help makes me vulnerable and I vowed never to be in that position and then that happens... Frustration, anger and too damaged flooded in. Today was one of those days.

Suic-1077,im desperate: i want to kill myself but i don't think anyone is treating it as an immediate reality,"Yesterday I told my dad that I was suicidal, and having thoughts of suicide. I have been dealing with this since year 9 (in year 12 now) and it recently escalated (past two weeks) to the point that it was no longer passive, but I recently made a plan. He called the mental health triage people (we're in SA) and they sent out some people to evaluate me two hours later. The two that came (a social worker and a nurse) were pretty dismissive, and made it seem that because I was able to clearly express myself and I wasn't confused or something, and because I was purposefully not sleeping enough (to punish myself, might I add) I was less of a risk to myself, and that all I needed to do was sleep more and stay nourished. Which is bs (but they will be evaluating me properly by Monday with psychiatrists and stuff). Now I'm regretting telling anyone, because I'm not allowed to be home alone by myself, and my phone is taken before I go to bed. Along with my computer. I regret telling my parents because I suspect the most that will happen is that I will get a psychiatrist. But I don't want to exist in the immediate future. There's no way I'm going to a psychiatric hospital, even though I suspect its the only thing that will stop me from killing myself. My parents (my mum especially, my dad went to his rural job - locum, he's a general practitioner today) don't really seem to genuinely think that I'm this close | | to killing myself.

Suic-1082,"About to loose another one, and can’t say goodbye. (BRIEFLY MENTIONS SUICIDE)","Hi everyone. I’ve just learnt a few minutes ago that I’m about to loose my Great Uncle who I call Uncle Moose. And the worst part is that even though I’ve lived only a 5 minute drive from him. And I’ve barely got to see him! And I can’t go into the hospital and say goodbye and have a decent conversation because of COVID restrictions. Or ring him on the telephone because now he is unable to talk. I’ve already talked before about my mental illness and disability here before. And already I was having problems trying to not kill myself. And I’m not quite sure I’ll be able to make it this time round. I was not aware that he was unwell until just now. But looking back, I can notice the signs already. He was giving me some items he loved, like information of the Queen Mary back in 1998. And the London to Sydney Air Race in 2001. And when I was having Afternoon Tea today, there were mentioning Uncle Moose in a solum way. If I knew he was sick, I would run down to his house to hang out with him. This is a repeat of what happened to my Grandad who I called Q, Uncle Moose's Brother. But we knew he was sick 9 years before he died. I don’t want any more of this! I am worried that this is only the beginning of the line. I’m worried I’m next. Then Marnie (my grandmother), Dora (my pet’s as therapy guide dog), and everyone else that I know and love. I feel like I’m coming apart for the 2nd time! I know we can’t change the past, but we can change the future. There is still enough time to go in and speak to him and spend time with him. But they won’t let me in to say goodbye. And that time is shortening extremely quickly. I need to go in and talk about everything. Because I know from my experience is, even if they can’t talk. If they’re obviously awake, like eyes open, eye contact, breathing. Well then they can still hear me. All I want to do from this evening onwards is to inside his room for the whole day and talk to him about all kinds of stuff that I would of talked about for all of these years that have gone.

Suic-1085,It's been a while,"Hi, I first self harmed in highschool. My mum was on drugs and often acted in distressing ways that resulted in trauma for me. It grew in intensity till I was about 19 when I managed to find help and a way out. I was at least able to stop injuring myself badly. It's flared up once or twice since (I'm now 33) but not as bad as I no longer drink to excess (it was the combination of drinking and self-harm that really got me into trouble). Anyway.. Its been more difficult for me lately. I'm going through a rough patch. Its difficult (but probably good) because I have small children.. I'm basically never alone and things that leave lasting marks are not an option for me. I'm already wondering how I will explain my scars to them when they eventually ask. I think that is helping me not be too stupid. But in the moments when my emotions are so intense I can't cope I take myself quietly away and do something that hurts but will fade. Anyway.. I tried to bring it up with my counselor but she didn't engage with it at all. It was in the context of something else we were discussing and she just let it go by. Id actually worked up a lot of nerve to tell her about it and when she didn't really respond to it at all I felt terrible. Like I must just be seeking attention in her eyes or.. whatever. I don't understand why. Is what I'm doing not counting?? I don't know what I had hoped for, I think I just wanted to talk about it, to not have it as this hidden thing I was doing.

I can, however, see my future in these forums as our savings and social support dwindle. I have been diagnosed with Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome which currently has no cure. It took a while to get A diagnoses and I have just surfaced with the help of a ludicrous amount of neuropathic pain killers beyond survival mode for the first time in three years.I'm lucky that I had a firm routine of mindfulness and journaling in place prior to this. When I was diagnosed I was immediately referred to pain specialist and a psychologist, but as I live in a regional town and mental help is practically non existent. I haven’t heard anything from the psychologist and as a “urgent” patient the pain specialist in the closest metro area will see me in February. The use of prescription pain killers is not sustainable. I’m angry that the lack of regional health care means that a delayed diagnoses means I didn’t get appropriate care and I have little chance of recovery. I feel that I have no agency in my own health care, I’ve lost my ability to work full time and am quickly losing mobility. I would move closer to good health care, but I recognise I don’t have the Physical strength atm to make that happen. I fear for my relationship with my husband as he is both primary carer for me and income Provider. It’s not fair to him. I do not see myself willing being a burden on him, I don’t want him to be a carer, I don’t want him to be a frazzled man old before his time, tied to home duties, sick of the baggage that comes with dealing with someone in pain.

Suic-1095,*Trigger Warning* Triggered my recent sexual assault allegations in parliament,"Hi, TRIGGER WARNING ️ I haven’t been here since my last hospitalisation in august last year. Despite some ups and downs things recently have been good. Got a new job have moved into my friends place and I’m in the process of buying a house (scary). but the latest allegations of sexual assault by a cabinet minister from a woman who suicided last year have sent me into a bit of a spin. Then I read a sex trafficking story and the parallels in that story resonated with what happened in my marriage. The divorce last year was a major reason for my hospitalisations. I started to self harm again and that made me realise that I’m still very much not ok. I’m not seeing a psychologist as money has been tight and I haven’t found one that’s a good fit. My GP has been great but keeps referring me to my psychiatrist who is not so great at talking therapy. idk do you ever get over the trauma of sexual assault? I don’t want to be seen as a victim. But I think not acknowledging my early experiences or sweeping it under the carpet of outward success was what led to a highly insidiously abusive marriage. It was hard to recognise it for that but now I finally see it for the manipulation that it was. I’ve finally realised what my GP was trying to say all along. That it doesn’t matter how life treats you. Good or bad it’s still the same s**t underneath.

And by family I mean parents and siblings. I'm so suicidal right now (have been for years). Uni just started and I already feel like deferring... Nothing makes me happy anymore btw (like hobbies and stuff) been like this for a while now. I'm on medication but even that doesn't help that much.

Suic-1097,Concerned and at a loss...,"Hey Everyone, my apologies for this extremely long winded post as I’m currently at a loss as to what to do as and who to seek help from, as me and my husband have been married for 10 and a half years been together for over 11 years. We both have depression and anxiety. He suffers also from acute paranoia and has had epilepsy himself since his childhood. the problems that’s been going on for awhile now is that 6 years ago our marriage had some big issues and was in trouble, we did seek counseling, went through 3 counselors. The 3rd one really helped but the company couldn’t no longer allow the counselor to keep helping us. We’ve also had severe issues with our current neighbours who live above us and the previous neighbours who were violent towards me and has caused my husbands paranoia to flare up. My husband has also had psychological issues with his father who’s been abusive to him. one other thing is my husband has had bad relationships in the past that have all cheated on him. And because of the history with his ex’s it’s left him questioning every thing I do, or any one else who he knows. His paranoia has gotten so bad that he thinks his own friends are going to hit on me and that I will leave him. im now at a loss of how to help him, as he’s currently still seeing a psychologist, a psychiatrist and still is seeing his current doctor. Everything I say or do seems to be going through one ear and out the other no matter how much I try to comfort him, he’s also saying he’s given up on his life.

When we have a weekend away, it generally ends with a massive argument in the car on the way home because I am not open to his suggestion. I am not a confident person and find the idea challenging. I want to be more fun and spontaneous, but his mood is so up and down, I am struggling with our relationship. He is either fully on (affectionate and caring) when he believes we have made 'progress' towards his goal, or completely removed and distant if he feels I am not on board with his idea. I really don't know if I want to be in this relationship anymore. This scares and distresses me, as we have had, until a year or so ago, a fantastic life together.

Suic-1101,"What exactly is ""crisis""?","Hi... This is my first time here. I've been contemplating and searching for forums and online support for a while and thought I would post. I look at all the supports online.. all the phone numbers.. and I wonder, what is crisis? What constitutes being in crisis? Do I have a right calling those lines when I am having a ""bad night""? This is my dilemma... I am a self-harmer... I am not ashamed, it is a coping mechanism and, though I have controlled it, when I am at my worst and having a ""bad day"" my mind searches for something to self-harm with. Am I in crisis at this point? Should I be calling someone? I know if I physically talk to someone I will bawl my eyes out, and control is something I pride myself on (or what eventually breaks at that point). I have a counsellor but her time is sparse so there are 6-8 week gaps in our sessions. I just don't feel I have a right to call...

Suic-1103,So lost,"I honestly do not know what to do. My wife refuses to get help for childhood sexual abuse and for other issues throughout her childhood. We have been together for a decade now. And she was fine until the 3rd trimester of her first pregnancy. She suddenly devoloped pains during intercourse yet nothing was found. As the years have gone on her mental health has slowly declined and anything to do with males doing or saying the wrong thing to her she would get extremely worse and her medical problems both sexually and other unknown cause problems have become more regular and worse. We no longer have any form of sexual relationship and has been like this for roughly 7 8 months. The sexual side I am not worried about. Since all these problems began she has become more and more emotionally detached, no affection, no communication, i try to approach her and explain how this is now affecting me mentally, i just get shut down and blamed for anything or everything or if I stand my ground She believes everyone hate her. She isolates in her room at home will still get up to make a meal for kids but anything they do wrong she just gets angry and starts slamming things and goes back to hiding in the room. Kids get kids are just being snapped at for anything. I say something and then she is doing same to me. I have asked her to get help she refuses as doctors never find anything and talking does not help as councillors have said its in her head. My mental health has been getting worse as a result. Being treated like I am hated yet she is happy when around others makes me feel hated it pkays on my head questioning if she is faithful. I am heart broken knowing she is a victim and am being left to feel like a failure as a husband lover and friend. Anytime she is upset I ask and reassure I am here for her all I get is "" Im fine"". I now feel non existant in my marriage. To make this all better everything else is going wrong. My father died 3 days after xmas, my son came to me anout being sexually assaulted by kids his age, our financial position is screwed as talking about her money just triggers her also our cars broke down mine having to be sold for scrap as repairs were byond our means my wifes car same day dad passed.

But now, the pressure of knowing that I am the only thing between me and my end, that there is no safety net, there is no service that will help me or no person in my life that knows how, makes me feel completely defeated. What I wouldn't give for someone to take control for me at this point. They say to speak to someone if you are not OK. So I guess I am wondering, what now?

Suic-1111,Fear of becoming another Victorian lockdown statistic,"I have fought the urge to write another thread here today, but am feeling extremely isolated due to the latest snap lockdown in Victoria. I’ve had a bad couple of weeks and came close for the first time ever, to ending it all. I ended up being talked into going to hospital emergency where I was admitted for 3 days of care. I then transferred to a residential recovery centre, supposedly for a couple of weeks, but due to a number of circumstances, including covid restrictions, ended up home on my own again, but with a small positive hope of some face to face support in my community…. then the lockdown happened! I live in a regional community where no case have ever been, but I have to endure the isolated lifestyle because it’s the law, and my struggle has been worsening independent of covid. When admitted to hospital, I had the most severe anxiety and depression I have ever experienced and spent most of the time crying for no reason. I fear now the same cycle is beginning, with the anxiety pangs building, and feel the never ending restrictions leave no hope of every recovering. I wish I could live in another state, where on the whole most people have lived with some degree of freedom. I live on my own, and I am now not allowed to visit anyone, nor anyone come to my house. Surely if I’m in such a state, there could be an exemption for that, as I may end up gone anyway, regardless of the risk of covid infection. I have been given a local crises hotline, but I’m too timid to ring it. And no one is allowed to physically visit me anyway. I'm condemned to talk to people on virtual for the rest of my life!

If people ask me how im doing i always reply with “im fine, everything is good” the only reason why i reply in this way is because i know noone would understand or help properly.

It may seem like im battling with just myself and others but in reality for me... its having another PERSON OR ME inside of my brain. It keeps talking and talking. Sometimes it gets so overwhelming that i just speak out loud “shut up, be quiet!” in the middle of class. Ofcourse it’s embarrassing when people look at me in shock which again makes my stress level go higher. I BARELY look at peoples faces.

Suic-1118,How do you tell your parents about depression & suicidal thoughts?,"Hey guys, I'm a return visitor but have never had the courage to start a thread before. I hope I haven't missed one that's discussing this exact question... How do you bring this up? Do you bring it up at all? A bit of context: I'm in my 30s, my family is back in Europe, my brother died of cancer when he was 20. So I'm the only child left, and I do think that's one of the main reasons why I'm still alive. The first time I thought about suicide was when I was 11. At 27 I was diagnosed with depression for the first time, even though I had episodes way before then, but I never told anyone. At 27 I was here studying and couldn't keep up, so I had to see a GP and get paperwork done to be able to study part-time for a semester. That was the one time I casually mentioned this ""one-off"" to my parents, I figured they would ask why I wasn't coming home yet... Since then I've had countless relapses, and it's pretty clear to me that this is an ongoing issue for me. I never told my parents about the relapses, even though they may have had a suspicion when I was living with them for a year. I've been back in Australia since 2015, and things have been going well for much of it, apart from a bullying situation at a workplace, which I left in the back of an ambulance after I intentionally harmed myself. (My parents don't know this part either.) Since then I've had a lot of therapy with someone I feel really comfortable talking to, I've changed meds to something that really helps, and I'm doing what I can to stay well. But I'm also struggling with a few physical medical conditions at the moment, so here I am... I need to make a decision about work, because I simply can't do full-time right now, even though I love my job. I'm even thinking of quitting and just not working for a while, because I'm so miserable recently. And that brings me back to the question: how would I explain this to my parents? And how much do I tell them? Would they really want to know, even if they can't do anything? They've been through enough over their lifetime, I don't want them to worry about me, especially being on the other side of the world, during covid where we can't just visit each other. Also, even though everything's a bit shit right now, I'm still hanging in there, and I'll get through this. So they shouldn't have to worry about that.

Suic-1123, I don't know if/how my life can be fixed. I used to drink to cope.,"Hi all, I can't stress how much I hate myself. For most of the last year, I abused alcohol excessively because my psychiatric and psychology and mindfulness treatments and medication weren't working well enough. I stopped drinking completely about 4 weeks ago as I wanted to get better after getting really physically sick and learning that my liver was diseased as a result. I've since started going to the gym and eating 'somewhat' more healthier, but I've noticed absolutely no improvements to my depression and anxiety. Besides, the damage is already done, and even if I could fix it, there are still so many bad aspects mainly about my personality that have been life-long and impossible to fix. So my life is ruined, for example: - I'm unemployed. I can't hold down a job because I have absolutely zero self-esteem, meaning I can't handle any criticism no matter how constructive it is (I take everything to heart), I really don't think I'm good enough for anyone, and I crumble under any pressure or stress.

I kind of want to get help as I'm sick of living like this, but I don't know how to get help. I do not want to talk to my parents as they're awful people and I just want to get away with them. My school's welfare guy and counsellors aren't that helpful and I don't trust them. Unfortunately, the only person I would talk to is a drama teacher who isn't actually my teacher anymore, but I seriously can't imagine that conversation going well. I do have a sister who I'm kind of close to but I can't be around her because (bear with me) she is everything I'm not and I feel worthless around her.

Suic-1125,My apologies for this rant,"Hi to whoever is reading this, It feels strange to write this in public or rather online. Anyways, here I go. Not long ago (a few months or so), I have started getting more and more suicidal thoughts/imaginations. There were also times during a day or a week, where I can vividly imagine myself getting harmed and get this tingling sensation. I always find it hard to express myself, and only I have started to learn to communicate this properly with my partner. By communicating with my partner, I feel like I'm still a baby step towards understanding the real root of this problem. I haven't really had the best relationship with my mother since she was divorced when I was 5-7 years old (constant arguing, shouting etc..). I only came to find out they were divorced when I was 10 or so. Arguments got worse (I have anger issues) when we moved here in Australia with my step father. I was able to find out the reasons why they divorced when I turned 18 (I just turned 25 last month). Even though all of this is acceptable and may seem normal (I know even worse family problems that were shared online), I can't seem to stand the fact that I was left clueless of what was happening around me. The constant arguments grew bigger to the point that I can't stand to see my mother, without raising my voice. Sometimes I ignore my little brother (he's 10 now), my step father, and my mother, mainly because I don't feel like talking to them (can do this for months). I also hate the way my mother and step-father is raising my half-brother. I always feel guilty towards my half-brother, I can't be a good older brother to him and I am still trying. I tend to overwork for long hours (10+ hours a day) to ignore these thoughts. I am now at the final year of my PhD program and it sucks to have these thoughts. You would imagine a PhD student who's both smart and mature. But I really am not. Things got worse now that I am back living with them due to COVID and would like to save more of my stipend scholarship for future means. Everytime I overhear my mother and step-father talking about me, I always think of the worse. Why can't they just say this to my face? Anyways, my apologies for the rant. Reading over what I have written really clarifies that I think I myself is the problem. However, it has been clouding my mind for the whole year to the point, it may be better to just disappear, which I think is stupid.",Encar,Community Member,23-11-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/my-apologies-for-this-rant/td-p/521094
Suic-1126,A confession,"Hi everyone, I'm not sadfishing, I promise. I just desperately want to get something off my chest. I'm a failure. Let me start from the start. I'm a lawyer, but not a particularly successful one. I certainly wouldn't retain myself. I'm not very bright. I've worked very hard, both as a student and a solicitor, but with no real skill. My second failure is as a husband and father. I poured committment into my work that I should have put into my family, with predictable results (divorce; kids overseas). When I skype with my children I have to plaster a smile on my face: one day they'll be old enough to know their dad is a parasitic version of Al Bundy. I'm not a black and white thinker: I know I've done good in my life - written and volunteered and always tried - but none of that seems to matter. It can never be enough to tip the scales. I've thought about ""doing something stupid"", but for me that would be a mortal sin for which there is no absolution (no judgment of those who think differently).

Suic-1127,New Year's in the Psych Ward,"I'm really struggling at the moment. At the beginning of the month I was released from the mental health unit at the hospital because I was thinking about hurting myself. It's been a few weeks, and I've ""settled"" back into life at my parents house. Every day is harder and harder for me to wake up because I feel the feelings slowly creeping up on me a little more each day. I never feel happy. I noticed looking at all the pictures/videos of myself on the new phone I bought before Christmas. Every picture of me, the smile is fake. Its like this heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach or attached to my lower back, sometimes I try to ignore it, but it's always there- slowly eating away at me, and I don't know how much more I can take. A skater (I'm a skater. Started 6 months ago. Helps with depression.) committed suicide a week or so ago and it makes me feel so irritated because I know quite a few of the people who were friends with him. I had never heard of him until his passing, and then I realised how famous he was. How many other skaters in the community had skated with him and known him and done nothing about it. Been so selfish that they didn't even notice or care to help a member of their OWN community. Another guy killed himself last year. Why do we not help each other. Why have we let it come to this. What am I supposed to do. I've been dwelling on it a lot, and I'm not sure how to get their attention. How to change their ways. I'm so impulsive these days, I stuff my face with food when I'm sad, I do things like graffiti. I don't give a shit about this life or about myself. I wish it would all go away. But it can't. So I've gotta keep on doing things that make me feel alive. I'm a terrible person. I hate myself. My mind is a mess. I am a mess. Everyone hates me. No-one cares. I don't feel anything. My memory's stuffed. Lowkey wanna die right now. P.S - I have borderline personality disorder that's why I'm all over the place.

Suic-1130,Will time save you?,"Here at bb forum we regularly suggest ways to avoid suicide thoughts and planning. Things like- a change of environment which could be as basic as a walk around the back yard, a call to lifeline, talking to a friend and so on. I suggest time might well be your greatest gift to yourself. How often have you said to yourself or a family member ""I feel much better than yesterday""? How often have you been stressed and a partner offers you a drink and chat, then you feel better? Time is a tool for delay, an often overlooked method of allowing your distressed mind a break from a traumatic period. Why is it not thought of.? My theory is that one is caught up in the moment, a feeling of entrapment, no escape other than taking one's life. To get personal, I inadvertently gave myself some minutes of reflection prior to my planned act and that short period of time produced a memory of what my father told me 2 years prior ""better to be the best part time dad than no father at all"". He was referring to my marriage troubles and he already had one son suicide on him. I've always been convinced that up to recalling my father's comment, my thoughts and plans were rushed, desperate and lethal. The topic is raw, it's also tragic. Being kind to yourself a phrase we use here often, can include some time to let your mind regroup, return to a more relaxed state...to be calm. Be aware that a desperate mind is a rash one, one whereby you are not rational, maybe not even thinking of loved ones and their future sorrow and grief. Give yourself the gift of time....a free gift to you. If time saves you then take the next step of saving yourself and seek help. It's worth the effort.

Overall I had a positive experience at the ward and felt like I was finally going to turn my life around. However, the moment I settled at home, I have been crying and it feels like I am relapsing again. I even feel like going back to the psych ward because I just feel so overwhelmed at home.

Suic-1133,Reallyconfusedchronicanxiety,"Hey there fellow beautiful people. This is only the second time I’ve posted on here, I feel a little desperate. I am usually quite an outgoing person and quite positive, I do fall into depressive states but usually they only last a day or two, maybe a couple weeks if they’re bad. I have been feeling more anxious then anything lately but it also so made me really depressive for a time. I was suicidal for weeks, sometimes locking myself in my wardrobe l, making plans. I’ve never self harmed before, but I think I lash out on myself in a lot of self destructive ways, such as my diet. I feel really fat and I know it’s not healthy. I did stop drinking about 6 months ago and I feel like this started coming on since then. But anyway what’s really distressing me the most is this constant anxiety I have. I’m not used to feeling like this at all, it’s gotten to the point where if I think about going outside I start getting panicky and seeing stars. Just to go outside! The doctor gave me medication which I tried and I started hallucinating and having really bad suicidal urges I had to stop and now thinking about trying something else, is just - it seems crazy. Some days I really do want to get better and not give up on myself. My friends keep reaching out to me, I’ve kind of been isolating myself for a few months now. Sometimes I think it’s for their own good because I honestly am not myself and can’t be the friend/ person they’re wanting to reach out too and if I did end up going through with a plan then it would just involve them more. I’m usually the type of person that’s quite spontaneous and confident. Idk, I’m 24. Has anyone ever had anxiety this bad before? Sorry my stories so long and rambly. I’m kind of fed up with myself I feel ridiculous, like I just wanna shake myself and make myself go outside and stop being so dramatic - that’s honestly how I feel but I can’t physically do it it’s like there’s some block I just freeze, spin out and then end up in a ball crying or starting to make food.",Miloisyum,Community Member,25-01-2021,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/reallyconfusedchronicanxiety/td-p/528177
Suic-1134,Self harm relapse,"Hi, I've been doing so well and for the past couple of months, I have not self-harmed at all. I used to harm myself regularly but after I had a particularly bad reaction to my medication and was admitted to hospital, I was able to turn things around for a time. It helped that a good friend of mine asked me to send him a message every time I harmed. He didn't want to keep a check on me, he wasn't judging, he just wanted to know and in a way, it made me feel less alone and as a consequence, the harming ended. I can feel myself spiraling again and I have begun harming myself. I want to reach out and tell those people I love that I need help again but I am so very ashamed that I have had a relapse. I have a very open group of friends that are like family and they know a lot about who I am and the reasons behind my depression. At times, they bring up that I am a ""self harmer"" or will say something about particular behaviours and thought patterns that I have had previously. When they do, even if I tell them that I do not think that way anymore or do those things, I find that they do not truly believe me. I feel resentment for this because I have worked so very hard to get better. My fear is that the progress I have made in convincing them I have moved forward will be undone as soon as they find out I am self harming again. I'm tired of moving forward only to slide back and I am too ashamed to tell my best friends that I need them again.

Suic-1135,Partner acting out of character. Paranoid and Manic.,"I've recently been experiencing relationship stress and I'm beginning to feel isolated and deflated. My partner and I have been together for over five years and we never experienced any significant issues before now. A few months ago, he injured himself at work and is now experiencing nerve pain in his back. As a result, he has ceased work and is going through a tiresome workers comp process which has presented with a lot of stressors in itself. On top of this, he has been on a range of medications including heavy pain meds, nerve pain medication, specific prescription anti-inflammatory meds etc, plus being in pain constantly with and the boredom from no longer being able to work (he previously enjoyed work). In addition, his sleep has been disrupted, often going all night without sleeping and then catching up on rest during the day. I can only imagine this may be a situation where things will eventually start to unravel. I've recently noticed a decline in his mental health, where he becomes almost paranoid, obsessive, cynical and I often cop the brunt of this. I've noticed his facial expressions in these moments change, and he can be quite intimidating and almost coming across as aggressive, whether he intends for this to happen or not. He often wakes me at around 2am to essentially blast me about things that would normally be perceived as menial, and he has linked all of these thoughts together to come to a conclusion that is not at all based on reality. Keeps telling me that I'm hiding something, that something isn't right - yet when I dispute this and question why he doesn't appear to trust me all of sudden, he then claims he never said that, and I'm making out that he is crazy. I have a high pressure job and we have the commitment of just purchasing a new home a few months ago. I'm getting warn out and family/friends dont appear to realise the severity of the situation as they dont see the extent of his behaviour. Sometimes I have thoughts about not existing, or what extreme measures I can go to within myself just to get some relief, as I'm truly feeling deflated and periods of depression I experience because of these pressures are intense. I cry almost every day and I honestly can't keep up with the yo-yo rollercoaster of my partner being loving an apologetic one minute, and seemingly manic and paranoid the next. Could his medication have put him into some intermittent manic psychosis? Or can stress trigger these sort of things?

I have been to see my GP and she thinks I'm Severely Stressed and have Anxiety, she's referred me to a psychologist for counselling. I've recently left a toxic workplace,- which was a tough decision during a pandemic- but my mental and physical health were deteriorating. I experienced multiple long episodes of burnout. The work environment would get better and I thought maybe I was just over thinking it or being too dramatic, but then I watched as colleague after colleague resigned before me. I'd applied for a few jobs whilst I was still employed, each interview went well up until I was asked the dreaded questions of 'why do you want to leave your current workplace?' and 'can we contact your current employer?'. So I resigned without a job lined up- scary- the last time i was unemployed and not studying was a long time ago. I've been applying for jobs, and I have interviews coming up (yay), however I've been experiencing self doubt, and thinking 'what if I do something wrong, what if I'm just walking into another bad situation'. Couple this with the 'why did you leave your last workplace' question and 'can we contact your previous employer?, and I'm reduced to an emotional mess. I've been crying on and off like a tap, sometimes I don't even notice I'm crying. This resigning thing was supposed to make me feel relieved that I don't have be there. I left lots of work for the few remaining employees to follow up, which makes me feel guilty, however I was not given the adequate time to wrap things up neatly, I was paid out for my notice period, and told not to come into work during this time. Friends have told me I need to stop letting it consume me and move on, and that I can't be picky about the next job, and just apply for everything, even if I don't want that particular role/job. But how do I do that when this organisation was my first job (my dream job) out of Uni and I have no other references? I've also been looking at a complete career change but find I need more qualifications which are expensive and I'm too highly qualified for govt fee assistance. I feel I'm still trapped in the toxicity even though I've left. I know there's not much anyone can do, it's just tough being in this situation, and I want to let anyone else experiencing a similar situation know that they are not alone.

I always thought along the lines of 'Ignorance is bliss' but now I'm thinking that 'Power is knowledge'. My problem is that I tried to change myself through self-harm. I would then say what thing I've become, like 'greedy', 'selfish', 'burden'. The problem was... it felt good and I have the urge to do it again and again. And I know that's not right. I'm at a loss. I have no one to talk to as everyone is busy with their own lives and my trust for my family is out the window.

Please be careful and take care of yourself. When I was a pre teen/teenager I used to self harm. Couldn't tell you if it was because of being sexually abused and never really sharing it with anyone, the inability to deal with all the emotions that being a teenager brought on, my dad having an affair after giving into his gambling habits and losing us our car and home, my mother falling deep into a state of depression and alcoholism after my dads aforementioned affair... Also not really having a support network, never really talking to a professional (apart from a few sessions with a school therapist at age 10 but it was more because the school just knew home life was not good at that time) I couldn't tell you which was the main cause, maybe all of it? Fast forward 15 / 20 years and I'm happily married with our first child on the way, my husband is loving and kind... my parents got back together (though they will never be ""okay"" my mum's too bitter for that, which is fair enough) and my lil brother is a wonderful man - we all live together. After became smoke free about 5 days ago and out of nowhere these feelings of self harm came flooding back. Know should have been smoke free much sooner because of baby but did manage to cut down to 2 or 3 a day after finding out.

Anyway, I self-harmed over it and I feel really bad for going backwards. I tried really hard to not self-harm but I only have my husband as a support and I just don't want to be here anymore.

Suic-1144,The let down,"For as long as I can remember I have been bullied. Whether it be from family, friends or strangers I get picked apart constantly. Mostly it's about the way I look. I'm the scapegoat, I'm the emotional punching bag, I am not good enough. Unless I change I'm unlovable, unworthy and a burden. I slowly feel myself withdrawing. I dread going out because I don't think I can handle the World. I try to talk to people but I get told I'm too sensitive and need thick skin. So then I feel guilty for feeling the way I feel. For the first time 6 months ago I was truly happy. I was expecting my first child. I had purpose, I had so much love to give. Then I miscarried. Any purpose I had was gone. I feel like I'm sinking into a hole and everyone can see me there but does nothing. I feel so alone and isolated.

Suic-1145,"My dealings with the health system, is it tailored more for female support? *Trigger warning - suicidal thoughts*","Hi there, I wasn’t sure which forum to post this on, I haven't frequented the forums for quite some time. I went through a couple of years of severe anxiety and depression some years back, and had support on here at the time. I've been muddling along ok since, with occasional times with mild A&D. I find as I'm getting older, my medical support needs are increasing too. (I'm a 60 male, long time divorced and recently retired, living on my own in a regional area). I’ve always had considerable trouble with finding a GP who is willing to give me the focus needed to address my medical concerns. It’s been more than 30 years since I’ve had one I could call, “my GP”. I know there is a stereotype of males choosing to ignore health issues, but I’ve never been like that…quite the opposite, if only I could get the attention of the health system like I see the women I know, expect. I’ve started to get annoyed, and feeling like I have to wait until it is serious enough that I won’t be disregarded for people who are really sick. Whenever I’ve mentioned the topic to people I know, they think I’m being defeatist, but I point out that I’m only feeling that way from my own experiences over the years. I’ve been told to just stand up and “insist” I get some attention. Apart from not being able to do that, I am also conscious these days that with the security issues in hospitals and clinics, that as a male, my insistence may be taken the wrong way, so I just accept it, as I am so afraid of the slightest verbal conflict. I fear I may just become another failed statistic of the health system. I'm a male who is historically a bit short on assertiveness, and with all the media attention on how bad men are to women as a general rule, find it hard to reconcile with myself that I even belong in this world now, just because of my gender. I’m probably being irrational about it, but I haven’t been able to invalidate those feelings in the highly charged social atmosphere these days, and increasingly my already lack of assertiveness when seeking medical support is amplifying this. I’ve talked to men who acknowledge they are taken more seriously when visiting the GP with the support of their female partners. My last severe anxiety attack was actually brought on by my dealings with the health system, and seems as if when I really need the support it in fact, makes things worse. I don’t really know what to do, as the very suggestion “to seek professional advice” causes me great anxiety!",DeltaJ,Community Member,26-05-2019,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,17,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/my-dealings-with-the-health-system-is-it-tailored-more-for/td-p/481385

I’m in my early 30’s and a father/husband, but I’m scared to let anyone know what’s really going on. I’ve thought about talking to a doctor but I always talk my self out of it with something like “no, I’ll be okay. I can make it go away” sort of attitude. But it never goes. Sometimes I’ll have a week of “peace” but that will often stop with nights like tonight. Where all my thoughts are screaming at me about how useless I am, or I’ll cry while I’m alone and the house sleeps.... And I’ll have really bad thoughts like “is it a big deal if I’m gone?” So far the thought of my wife and kids finding that has always made those thoughts go a little quiet, but I’m scared one day it won’t be enough.

I am ex military living with severe service related mental health issues and I am constantly being triggered by my neighbours, my street, my estate, my local council and police. I own my home and decided to settle down after years of postings all around australia. Before my home was built I had my new neighbours prying into our lives and being Military we have been very private people and we closed off from these new neighbours upon moving in as they would be at our doorstep before I could open the door to my car upon coming home. Since then they have now become our bullies and not only have they turned the whole street against us, they have turned the whole neighbourhood including the developers against us. We constantly receive complaints from our local council from these people, we constantly have the police at our house. I have been threatened to be raped, killed, had my property damaged, spat on, property stolen, called all names under the sun which has all been caught on our cameras with full audio and shown to QLD police who turned it all back on me and told me I was the crazy one and I needed to go to the psychiatric ward as I was hysterically upset and triggered by my military experiences. No matter what I do I am constantly harrassed and bullied to the point where I severely hurt myself to escape. We have built fences, put up signs to leave us alone, we keep to ourselves and all I need to get better is a safe zone which I dont have and havent had for the three years living here.

That wouldn’t be so bad. I don’t want to be a further burden on them but this is what I need. I can’t keep acting through this life. I have been thinking of ways I could commit suicide that look accidental, I just don’t know.

I have just been in a house with abusive housmates for 2 years, and then spent half a year locked inside with them because of covid where the bullying escalated.

I'm just trying to feel comfortable and now I can't wear a mask anywhere because it makes me want to cry because of the things he said to me so now I have to be uncomfortable and unsafe. It's stupid.

I ran away from my family for a reason and the fact that lack of money is what brought me back is so crushing and my depression is perhaps worse than it has ever been.

I’ve been off work almost 12 months and now on Workcover after having appealed my claim due to it being rejected the first time even though IME report proved work was the significant cause. I did claim income protection for a few months at first until my appeal had gone through and was approved in my favour after 6 months. I’m seeing my psyc fortnightly and GP and on medication. I suffer severe depression and anxiety from what had happened to me by my employer. My mood is severely low and think about suicide most days. I’ve denied this to my GP and psyc as I’m scared they will admit me and tell my family. I’m 40 years old and I can barley leave the house on my own. My TPD is worth over $700k. I did email my super case manager a few months ago about TPD process and they emailed me back a fact sheet etc. I know at this stage I’m in no position to return to any employment and Workcover ends end of 2021. Had anyone else gone through something similar? Everyday is a struggle and I can’t get over what my ex employer did.

Suic-1157,When does Mental Health Triumph Career Opportunities,"Hi, I want to talk about something that plays on my mind a lot and I would appreciate any insight or advice from this community. One of the main reasons I am hesitant to seek help is because of my future job opportunities. U see the field in which I am studying and hoping to attain a career in values mental health immensely. The jobs I am looking at require a mentally stable individual and when u apply for them your mental health records/history are looked into. Previous mental health experiences or records can have a significantly negative impact on the prospects for jobs in this field. Fyi the companies providing the jobs in this field have the legal permission to conduct in detail background checks which include mental health. They are in no way breaching anti-discrimination laws or legislations. Now to get to my point one of the main inner conflicts I constantly think about is whether or not I should seek help (realistically I need help) and essentially reduce my job opportunities for the future or deal with things on my own so that I can still attain jobs in this field. I guess I just want to know your opinions on this issue. Is mental health more important? Or should my dream jobs be more important? Thanks in advance for any advice.

Suic-1158,"I don't know where to go, which way to turn. I only see one realistic way out.","Hi, This may be theraputic. Dunno. I don't talk with anyone. I am approaching the greatest crisis point of my miserable life. 4 years ago, my wife of 15 years and I bought our first house, with a large mortgage. 'Twas made possible by the generosity of my mother who basiacally 'advanced' me part of my inheritance. It was a dumb move. We've had a troubled relationship due to never truly being 'in love'. First child was very early in our relationship. Second was a combo of trying to save our flailing relationship, and so our oldest wouldn't be on his own when things fell apart. I'm not without fault, I know. Wife is a control freak with bad anger. So I go along with stuff just to keep the peace. Because I didn't want to ever miss a moment with my kids. We're both bad with money. On the few occasions I've managed to save, she's found it and drained it. Last time was about 3 years ago. Didn't say anything either to keep the peace or because I'm a coward. Both. She would somehow lay the blame at my feet. I was diagnosed with depression years ago & put on meds. I eventually stopped the meds accidentally and felt a fog lift. The diagnosis surprised me as I've always felt how I've felt. Two years into the mortgage, we separated. But remained under the same roof. Earlier this year she had a life-threatening medical episode that has her re-evaluating life, and wanting us out from the same roof. Either sell or rent out the house. Some news yesterday about her life expectancy (which she will not share with me) has seen that come to a head. I've never been driven or decisive. And this is my downfall. I'm $10k in credit card debt. No savings. An average-wage level job. If I had to move out, I'd be sleeping in my car. Our mid-teen daughter wants to live with me. The ex accepts this, but flew off the handle at me for 'swanning around pretending to be the perfect parent', and throwing my mistakes from over a decade ago in my face. I don't think this is true - I'm just nowhere near as strict, impatient or demanding as she is. When she mentioned the life expectancy thing, it was about wanting to be sure our kids would be fine in the future. The only reason I'm still breathing is the kids. This life expectancy stuff has thrown a spanner in my works: it makes my ultimate solution impossibly harder because I can't leave my kids facing the prospect of not having either parent. So, I'm stuck here. I'm the epitome of an abject failure.

Im so torn between making a firm decision that im ready to leave but then imagining them when they realise theyll never see me again...I feel so selfish. I have delt with depression quite bad in the past, ive tried 4 different medications without success and one of the medications actually led to an attempt. I havent been back to the doctors at all, I dont want to keep trying multiple medications I just want to level my emotions out and control myself, control my life again...

Started crying and got a really heavy ball feeling inside my head.. also found out from doctor, that I’m low in iron, on a supplement now.. can iron deficiency cause these problems? wouldn’t hurt myself, but I do pick the acne on my arms a lot. also if I’m doing really well on a project, I’ll delete it out of impulse, and then regret deleting it.",24yearoldgirl,Community Member,23-12-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,4,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/hello/td-p/506193

Suic-1167,"New here, not sure why","Hello all, First of all i'm not really sure why i am writing this, i think at this point is more for me so i can actually try & make sense of my thoughts and why i feel and think like i do. I am male 43 y.o. I think it would be fair to say I had a rough childhood, ever since i can remember my father was physically, verbally, mentally & emotionally abusive. I was always told that i wasn't good enough & nothing i ever did was good enough. So i guess that is where all this started. So after struggling through my 20's with my issues, maybe that's a stretch, apart from being shy i think i had a fairly normal 20's, but there was always something there always something that held me back from getting married, having kids etc. I think it was because i didn't want to be a terrible husband and terrible father like i experienced and i would always end relationships when it seemed like i could get engaged or have kids. So, at 32 i met the most amazing woman who treated me like i had never been treated before, made me feel like the most important person in the world. A woman who listened to all problems and offered to help me find solutions and we did, i was happy. I should mention that she already had 3 children from a previous marriage & didn't want more, which for me was fine because didn't want to have children because of the environment i was bought up in. So all was good for a few years and then one weekend after the kids had gone back to their fathers she got a phone call from him, apparently one of the girls had said i touched her inappropriately, I will say that i am innocent and the thought is abhorrent to me. To say i was devastated and shocked would be an understatement. I remember for a month i didn't speak a word to her, i guess i blamed her for bringing the kids into my house. So long story short, police were involved, statements made, and there was no evidence but i had an AVO put on me. So after all that blew over and we were still together (per my request, i never had any further contact with her children) & life continues on im in therapy & on anti-depressants. Fast forward to 18 months ago and we break up & i am alone & lonely, with no friends, no-one to talk to & i basically go to work come home sit on the lounge & cry & when i've had enough of that i go to bed and cry until i fall asleep & repeat. I want to end it but i don't have the courage to do it, i dont even lock my doors anymore i lay in bed wishing someone would break in and kill me.",probablynotworthit,Community Member,22-12-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,7,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/new-here-not-sure-why/td-p/505585
Suic-1168,Left worse after asking for help,"Asking for help when broken and distressed all people want to do is call the cops on you. It’s suggested many places talk to someone like doctor etc yet all that you get is when you try and talk and say how your feeling they just want to call cops on you and drag you to a mental ward. It leaves you not being able to trust anyone and more distressed an led distraught than when you started. Just because you struggle with immense pain and you feel like you can’t take anymore saying even that has cops and ambos called on. Your just pushed from one post to the next like your a burden and problem that your crazy even accused of being dangerous yet all you have done is cry and be so frightened that you end up being so distressed you can hardly breathe. I’m not a violent or cruel person at all. Asking for help has put me feeling so much worse because of how I have been treated from reaching out. It has made me feel more like the glass is about to break. I don’t understand the constant mixed messages or just because you show emotions and get to a point where you are struggling with those emotions your treated like a no hope deranged person. Yet all you have ever been is kind, thoughtful loving and caring person. i have never gone onto anything like this before so not sure if this is right or any good but it is my last try. I’ve tried everything else even psychologist who just ended up breaching my privacy and confidentiality without my permission. So I can’t trust anyone now that could link to my identity because I’m too frightened I wish asking for help hadn’t cause me to feel worse.

Suic-1170,The Fine Line,"Yesterday I stupidly went into my father's room for the first time since I found him, I thought I was...but it was too overwhelming for me. And last night was possibly the deepest, crushing pain I have ever felt, for the first time I wanted it to go away so much, I just wanted to go to sleep and never wake up. I told my counsellor today what I thought about, and also what I had written down during the night, as I seemingly had tied up loose ends and thanked people in a letter I wrote, presumably to sort out my affairs in preparation of something. She was immediately concerned, and asked me if this was a cry for help and if she should call an ambulance. This is where I am confused, I myself do not know why I have penned a 5 page letter like this, I wrote it in the midst of excruciating pain and grief, I did not want to be here anymore at that time because the pain was too much, but I don't want to die either. I don't think not wanting to be here is the same as actively wanting my life to end, if my life was threatened or in danger I would fight for my life, I know dad would never give up, and he would not want me to give up, I was thinking how dad would react if he found me, if he found me that way it would destroy him. I can see him trying to wake me up and falling apart crying, as I was when I found him, I don't want to hurt dad, I Dad went through far too much for me to throw it all away. I think telling her and showing her my letter actually means I want to fight to stay, fight through the pain. I have never in my life felt this way, I could have threw it all away in that moment, a scary feeling I hope I never feel again. My GP offered me sleeping aid today, I declined, I think that was wise. Is this normal for trauma and grief? I have never lost someone so close before, my thoughts and emotions are out of control, I can be ok one moment, and then some smell or sound sparks my synapses, and sends my senses into freefall, I cry so hard my nose flows like a tap, I breathe so rapidly I feel as if I am about to pass out. I have tried to breathe slowly and close my eyes, time can seem to stand still whenever it feels malicious, mocking you with each second.",pl515p1,Community Member,04-12-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,6,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/the-fine-line/td-p/530486
Suic-1171,"My wife is threatening self harm, and I am part of the reason why","My wife of 7 years suffers from depression and anxiety. She has attempted self-harm on a number of occasions. I have had to physically prevent her from self harming. She has a lot of stress in her life. She has a stressful job with a heavy workload and bosses who don't seem to understand just how stressed she is. She has ongoing problems with her family. She has ongoing health issues, including having lost 2 babies over the past 5 years. We also have problems of our own, and I will be completely honest about them. We married in 2013 despite having already had fights. In 2011, early in our relationship, I went on a holiday to Europe I already had booked without her, and I was unfaithful while I was over there. (I am not proud if this at all, and yes I am aware of how wrong that was.) She knows about this and it often still does cause problems. I have also witheld my true feelings at times causing her to feel placated, like she can't make me happy, despite my insistence to the contrary. And I can be absent minded at times too, which doesn't help either. She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few years ago, and has had some counselling, which often ended up becoming more about the issues with her family than her actual anxiety. As I said, there have been times when I have had to physically restrain her from self harming. This evening a small spat over what to have for dinner turned into a full blown fight ending in her saying she wants to leave me so she can plan to end her life. Now, I freely acknowledge that my own stupid actions in the past have played a role in her feeling this way, and I accept responsibility for that. I try to lighten her stress by helping her out wherever possible. We have had similar fights before. I try to talk to her about it but she is determined to believe life is not worth living. Anything I offer to show she has something to live for she will counter. Besides more counselling (we don't have much money despite us both working full time, so I don't know how to make that happen) I am lost. Despite having been a less than perfect husband I care for her, I really do, and wish I knew what more I can do to help her. She seems ok for now, but doesn't want to talk to me at the moment, so I am keeping a respectful distance but being ready to intervene if I need to.",Random_Nickname,Community Member,15-12-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/my-wife-is-threatening-self-harm-and-i-am-part-of-the-reason-why/td-p/535779
Suic-1172,Not fitting in,"I'm 47 and have had difficulty my whole life in relating to other people. As long as I can remember this has been a major issue in my life and has resulted in low self esteem and subsequently depression to the point of a suicide attempt and repeated bouts of severe depression. I have undergone counseling without success. I have also done alot of research into my own behaviour and worked on issues which have developed from this low self esteem such as codependency and lack of assertiveness. I recently took nearly 5 months leave out of the work place where I found happiness within myself. As soon as I returned to the work the same problems returned. The happiest I have been was when I was in a relationship of 4 years which ended recently, which I believe was due to different values and a lack of boundaries. All things which should have been established in the early stages of the relationship and weren't due to my anxious attachment style. Now the relationship has ended the same depression has returned that i experience when I am alone. I have tried making new friends but struggle to make meaningful and close connections with people. I have tried being happy alone but feel worse. My social group is small and I often feel disrespected within the group also. I have tried being a loner and just spending time with my kids but still feelthe requirement for adult connection. I have also tried public speaking and researched books on how to make conversation. The positive thing is I am quite good at one on one chats with people in shorter doses. The struggle I have with fitting in, I believe is due to my socially awkward personality. I have always been picked on by groups of people, particularly males both inside and outside of work. I have a INTJ type personality with sometimes poor social skills. I also, seem to slip onto the dyslexic scale whenever I do an online survey!! My terrible memory and slow witt makes me anxious often in social situations. The constant social hammering results in low self esteem and eventually depression. I stand up for myself but eventually submit as I get worn down. Is there anyone else who can relate to this? If so how did you improve? My solution to the problem is to start my own business where I work alone and work a lot less as I am financially secure and do not need to chase money to survive, atleast not for a while. During my time off I can work on being happy alone by taking advantage of my freedom.

Suic-1174,Anxiety and Depression- new job,"Where do I begin? I'm a mess. I feel like I have no control over my life anymore. I suffer from anxiety, mainly social anxiety and sometimes I get super depressed to the point of suicide thoughts. I've never seld harmed but I just think about me dying and such. I worked as an SSO (student support officer) within a primary school, working 1:1 with some of the kids. I loved this job as I felt like I made a difference, like if I stayed home from work, that kid would feel the effects. It basically gave me a great reason to get out of bed in the morning. Well, end of this year comes and my contract is up. This is because the work isnt there for me (tiny school, heaps of kids leaving = no work for me). Now I feel lost. Been looking for new SSO jobs but there are none. Which sucks big time. I managed to get a job at a glass cutting factory (which I wasnt exactly keen about but at this point money is money) but the management never told me if I'd be getting paid or if I was on a trial, never spoke about my hours and never gave me an induction. To top it off they knew I was inexperienced in this field (told them in the interview) and on the day they were very rude about it. But I tried and soldiered on anyway - I was super anxious and didnt think I could get through it on the day and I did. So after the 1 day I left and said i wasnt coming back. Only because of what I mentioned. Which is stupid i guess. So now I dont know what to do, I'm stressing, so is my wife. We are trying to buy a house and now we cannot. I feel sick and have had some suicidal thoughts as i feel like I've messed everything up because I am unemployed and looking for a job and not being able to buy is my dumb fault. I dont really know what the point of this post is. Help, tips, guidance. I dont known...whatever else.

My psychiatrist keeps telling me I'm doing ok. He knows I am able to keep myself safe and that I will just keep on trying. But I'm not alright. My husband can see it too. He says I'm slowly returning to acting how I was when I was at my lowest. He's angry that I keep returning from the doctor without help. He says I perform beautifully in public and that I'm not letting the psych see the truth. But I'm not hiding it. I've been blunt as with the doc. Gotten angry even. I've told him at home I just sleep, binge eat and stare off into space then realise it's been hours. That I refuse to act on thoughts until my kids are grown but I keep having them anyway.

Suic-1184,How do you cope when you're on the edge of suicide?,"To summarise my thoughts, I don't want to commit suicide, but I don't want to do anything else, either. Mentally speaking, I am already kind of dead. I have given up, or at least it feels that way. I have been getting my head around a very difficult heartbreak. It happened two years ago, but I have not met anyone since. I hate it when I say this, because I can immediately feel the judgement, but we were never together. I have never been in a relationship before. I thought of her as a friend, and she knew how I felt, but she abandoned me. So I have had my heart broken, but I have nothing positive to show for what I've been through. I have no friends either. It is unbearably painful watching other people's love stories unfold around me. I didn't care about relationships until I got Depression. Now I NEED help. People say that you should be happy by yourself, but I am battling myself every single day. I can't rely on myself. Everyone around me is having sex with each other, and the best I can do is convince myself that I'll never need anyone? What does that say about me? I don't want to live a life without love for much longer, but I don't even know if a relationship is going to be worth it. It's going to take a LONG time to meet someone, and even then, what's the point? These last two years, and being broken in childhood, have taught me everything I need to know about how ""worthy"" I am. Obviously I am not meant to be here. Every argument to stay sounds very unconvincing to me. Every second I stay hurts me. Even being happy doesn't mean anything, because it doesn't make me any less alone. Who's going to care if I'm happy? This is the closest I can come to suicide, but I cannot commit suicide.

Suic-1185,Suicidal? how to survive this difficult time,"Anyone that has had plans/actions of a suicidal nature is an expert of that dark road journey. So much so in my case in 1996, I swore I'd never return to it. Apart from the ramifications to family and friends whom we have no intention of hurting, we risk hurt to ourselves sometimes lifelong. We've had more than one member here post details of their lifelong physical suffering for an act that left them injured. An important point here is that we emotional humans usually reflect on our recent past and say ""what was I thinking""? This is due to getting past an episode of negative and self destructional thinking to return to our normal selves. This is the first suggestion I'm making Accept that this dark period is temporary and the sun will rise again. Such swings will always swing back. Do think of family and friends and the hurt they will endure. Radical change- do ANYTHING to avoid suicidal thoughts. This could mean resigning from a job regardless of its consequences, travelling, leaving a relationship or ringing for help (Lifeline or Beyondblue 1300 22 46 36)- think outside the box. The dark road has escape exits Time out- delay your thoughts. Give yourself a chance. Refocus on the beauty of life perhaps you've forgotten about. Some examples of the above. The last thought I hd before I abandoned my attempt was my dad once saying to me ""better being a great part time dad than no dad at all"" An acquaintance that was gay deciding to come out rather than to continue down that road. He has a strong band of supportive friends now. A relative that found humans too emotionally destructive to her now rescues abandoned animals, nurses them then finds new homes. A hitchhiker I picked up in 1977 was clearly self destructive after his marriage failed. He had a baby son. He went on to become a cook on a sheep station and remarried. His son is now 44yo and joined him on the station at 18yo. In my case I left my narcissistic wife one week later. I pleaded with her to stop her silence treatment that had continued for the full 11 years after our wedding. Silence as a weapon is a form of narcissism (as opposed to not using it as a weapon). She blew a smoke ring in my face. I knew it was over. I took some time to recovery (good idea) built my own home for distraction., Most important- accepted that these things happen. Regain your strength, dont allow tyrants to win, be radical if it can save you and above all have faith in your own beauty and uniqueness.

Ive been struggling with depression for a really long time now and the amount of ostracism I keep going through at uni is making everything harder to cope with. Nobody is close to my age, none of them ever include me or talk to me and I keep trying to tell myself they are only teenagers bit it still hurts so badly to be purposefully excluded so much. I learned on a volunteer show that my upperclassmen never had any intention of giving me a role that I wanted because my ""behaviour"" was ""not going to be rewarded"". Ive overheard conversations saying im a ""downer"" and that im not ""fun"" to be around. Its really hard being back at uni when im so old, and not being able to rely on any of my peers for anything including academic support is so draining. I feel like a complete failure all the time, and its impossible to imagine a future that has any kind of fulfilment. Things have been really hard lately and im just so sad and worm down all the time. It feels like im going to slip into something im going to regret at any moment.",Radiocall,Community Member,04-12-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,1,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/losing-control-and-worn-down/td-p/530294
Suic-1187,"I just can't handle the lethargy, insomnia and social isolation","I am 21M, with ADHD, social anxiety and depression. I have a habit of socially isolating myself for very extended periods of time as I never learnt how to develop meaningful relationships after moving country at 13 and never feeling very close to anyone in my family. I graduated highschool in 2016 with an underwhelming ATAR after getting diagnosed with CFS in year 12. Through 2017-2018 I smoked weed daily to cope with the intense suicidal thoughts that I couldn't deal with anymore. I was also finally diagnosed with depression in late 2017, have been prescribed a plethora of ineffective antidepressants and was finally diagnosed with ADHD in late 2019. I'm on two different medications at the moment which have been effective. This year was really important for me. After discontinuing every semester at uni since enrolling in 2017, due to not being able to study, I was really trying to attend university this year. The classes and study didn't matter, but I have been so socially isolated over the majority of my life (even from 13-17 I never did anything outside of school and would just stare out of the window dead inside), and thus actually physically attending university and trying to interact with people was meant to be my step up out of the hole I've dug myself in. Now I have found myself in quite a rut. Although it is not as bad as I got earlier this year, especially with the gyms closing as strength training is my only activity that calms me down and allows me to work for something (I also can't run because of flat feet), I am just failing to keep moving. I feel myself physically shut down in the middle of the day, in a workout, anything. I have postponed exams in a week that I have yet to even learn the course for (one of which is from last semester), and I can't sleep. I can't focus, when I go to the gym I am exhausted and never manage to make any progress on my lifts. Along with the insane loneliness and inability to socialize following so many years without meaningful interaction, I just can't study and I can't manage my ADHD. I have started taking more of my medication to mitigate matters, but I think they just make things worse. I am just so sad and lonely all the time. I recently began to fantasize about a pact from years ago to kill myself if things don't improve. It's been a while since I passionately looked forward to death, and I just feel so stuck again without productivity and succumbing to rumination.",Mantec,Community Member,03-12-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,5,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-just-can-t-handle-the-lethargy-insomnia-and-social-isolation/td-p/530020

Kinda getting to the point where I just don't know what to do (understanding that statement is pretty vague). I don't know if I am am having suicidal thoughts or not, I just know that I'm tired and I don't want to keep going on... think its kind of like if I were in an accident, it would be doing me a favour, which has been like this for months; but now I feel like the opertunity has not presented itself for it to happen naturally.... and I'm still tired Man its hard not to slap myself across the face and delete this post Im not going to bore anyone with my story, am enough of a burden as it is. Essentially though I've been dealing with PTSD from working in public safety (fatalities that involved friends of mine that I wasn't aware of until I saw them in the line of work). This has resulted in, and I don't mean to row my own boat here, a very strong minded ""rock of a person"" ( I've been called before), being turned into a crumbling mess and embarrassing themself on a suicide forum. A friend recently committed suicide and it brings home that as bad as it is, suicide is an option. Im not saying that O agree with it, I just mean that it plays consistently through my mind that he chose that option, and after stalking his Facebook profile, it is flooded with well wishes and grief, and contrary to popular belief, it didn't appear from the social aspect of people remembering him that anyone is mad with the decision that he chose....

Suic-1189,What do you do when a friend is so dependent that it's crushing you?,"About three years ago, I noticed that an online acquaintance on the Xbox was struggling mentally so I reached out. Soon enough we were talking everyday on Messenger, in party chat or playing together. I started visiting him in QLD, he started visiting me in NSW. For all intents and purposes he was the closest friend I'd ever had. About a year ago, he started exhibiting signs of intense jealousy and paranoia. Keeping tabs on me through game trackers, watching my activity, waiting until I was playing with other friends to start fights. He demands attention, so I have to stop what I'm doing to give it to him or I come back to 20 messages which can range from insulting and berating me to threatening self harm or suicide. The insults are along the lines of that I don't care about him at all, I'm a bad friend, all I do is lie and make excuses for myself, I'm replacing him. He latches on to simple semantics and will fight with me about it for hours. For example, I once told him I was just doing one more thing with another friend then I'll wrap things up to play with him. He timed me, then lambasted me with accusations as to why that thing took so long and why would I tell him I was wrapping things up if I wasn't. I'm not oblivious, he's emotionally abusive and manipulative. I am his doormat. I in no way blame myself for anything he puts on me and I have made him aware that he manipulates and tries to control me through negative conditioning. We've had good talks about this and I know he actually cares for me, I've seen progress in his actions. He can be reasonable when he calms down, but when his emotions are getting the best of him I could be dying and his problems would still take precedence. No amount of reasoning and evidence will convince him that he's the problem, he will always play the victim. I was already coping with several mental illnesses and a self-harm addiction, now with his unhealthy dependency on me I'm drowning. It's not as simple as blocking him because we share friends and he knows where I live. I don't even WANT to avoid him, I just want him to wake up to himself and be the friend I had for those two years. I've urged him to get professional medical help, but he refuses. I want out of this situation some way, it's steadily declining my mental and physical health. But I've never been good at putting my own needs first. My walking away would mean more suicide threats, and I could not live with myself if he went through with it.",ClockworkBlonde,Community Member,01-12-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,12,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/what-do-you-do-when-a-friend-is-so-dependent-that-it-s-crushing/td-p/529025

I have had other individual relapse occasions but this is the worst relapse in a while. I won't mention how as that is not appropriate but what scared me was it felt good (I am in no way promoting self harm as I know deep down it is not healthy and only offers temporary relief). I found I was calm afterwards and it temporarily relieved my inner turmoil. I currently have no support network. I don't see a psychologist and my family are unaware of my behaviour. I guess what I wanted to ask was how do you guys deal with the shame and guilt of relapsing? How did you eventually get some help? I am not yet ready to reach out and ask for help but I hope I am in the near future.

Suic-1194,*Trigger warning* I made a plan,So I've made a plan. Is this a vent. A cry for help. I don't know. This has been thought about for weeks now and I have tried every distraction I can think of and do. None of these have worked I have thrown myself into each of them to the brink of becoming physically unwell. Its part punishment knowing I don't deserve anything good not even this life of mine I'm currently living. It's to change these thoughts and part trying to take myself out before I plan to carry out the plan. My counsellors are all unaware they are concerned because the past few sessions with each of them I have sat in the chair in almost silence to not allow my voice to accidentally slip up and say the wrong things making them even more suspicious. I don't want to be locked away for my own protection. I want to make this final choice for myself. Lately it feels like choices have been taken away from me or been made for me. I have tried to re-anchor myself to stay for my kids I can't my brain won't allow it. The dissociation makes it feels like I've been picked up in a cyclone and it hasn't tossed me out yet dumping me somewhere. As it has been life has been swallowing me whole then spitting me back out.

In the last six months, I have attempted suicide twice along with a number of attempts at self-harm. Just a few months ago, I ended up having to go to hospital in the back of an ambulance because I had a severe anxiety attack. So far, it has been getting progressively worse and I have no idea what to do. I am feeling extremely lost inside and I am unsure about where or how I can get help. This was the only place I could think of as I don't have a phone and it upsets my friends every time I talk to them about something like this. Often, talking to my parents struggles to get me anywhere as I sometimes struggle to get along. I also lack access to teachers and councellors at school as I am on a shortened timetable. I find that one fix is consuming caffiene, which only works temporarily. I hear that it can give you anxiety. Bullying has also been a severe issue for me. Particularly because it was my best friend from last year who kept picking on me. I am really finding it difficult to get help and I am just lost.

I am 31 and there is no one in my life other than my parents who cares about me. And even they are getting sick of me. They think I'm too old to be looking to them for support but I have no one else. Noone ever answers my messages, I reach out to lots of people but never get responses, or I get really short responses with zero effort. And I even try and keep it fun by sending funny stuff, or memories, gifs etc. Churches constantly let me down, doctors let me down, people in general just let me down and disappoint me. I've come to a point that even if someone does make plans with me I always expect them to not show up or cancel all together and that's exactly what happens. I'm just not important. I have never been in a relationship and I don't know why. I am athletic, I play sports, I also play many instruments. I am smart and I have a sense of humour. I may not be the most attractive person but I am not hideous. I just missed something and got left behind at some point.

Suic-1197,How do I go on ??,"My sister committed suicide in December 2019. It was devastating and I have been struggling so much & tonight I have been self harming to cope. I miss my sister so much. We were very close and I had 2 sisters. All of our lives we have been mentally abused by our ""mother"". She is a narcissistic and controlling witch who drove a wedge between each of us with a lifetime of lies. I have only just been back in touch with my younger sister after 15 years due to the lies our ""mother"" created. But when we fell into each others embrace, this January, we went straight back to that beautiful, close sisterly bond we have always had. It took the death of our beautiful sister to bring us together but I know she would be so happy that us ""stupid bitches' are talking again. That's how we roll. My ex husband died 2 months before my sister and that was difficult to accept too as even though we were divorced, we were still very close. Now I am alone except for my two little dogs and I feel like my time is coming to an end. Being back in touch with my younger sister is wonderful and I love her so much but she has her own family to care for, she can't take me on as well, even though I know she is very worried about me.

Poeple stop having problems at that time?,"Apologies for all the typos, I’m shaking so badly my fingers are bouncing all over the keyboard. I’m sure there are people willing to text chat at 2am, but I’ve been scouring the web for days, and nothing. I can’t do phone due to crippling social anxiety. I’m under immense emotional/psychological stress from housemates. One is my just-ex of a 15 year relationship, and she knows ever tiny weakness I have, and she’s using them to shred me, (i have several mental ilnesses) I’ve had a box cutter shoved in my face (by her older son by previous marriage) cliched shaved head, works out, nazi tatoos and (supposedly) ceased long term ice habit, who told me ‘I’ll cut you*. I managed a trip to the polie station today with the help of an innaporpriate amount of benzos. One officer was nice, one not ( they play good cop bad cop with victims now?) I was unwilling to get an intervention order,because this guy is not sane, I’ve been around enound to see it make things worse as much as better, even the officer said, at the end of the day, it’s only a piece of paper. Anyway after after i left the station, for whatever bizzarre reason, they decided that the son, being the physical threat, might benefit from a call to his mother, explaining i had concerns. I might be guessing, but i would think that’s illegal, or at least malpractice. As you might have guessed, this helped like dropping a nuke on it, except it didn’t end the war, it made it nuculear war. I don’t get angry or violent. Not that i don’t want to , but any confrontation and my axiety basically makes me shake so hard i can’t hold up a cup. I can’t find any live chat help, especially re: emergency housing, or social housing anytime in the next ...years (i’m on a disability pension). The couple i did see on a page cost $350 A WEEK for a small 2 bedroom unit. I’m currently paying $290/fnght for a 3 bedroom house. anyway, almost emergency housing type things want a police report, ive gone to crazy lengths to avoid that, as all my ex wanted for years was to be reunited with her son. I don’t care emotionally much anymore, but they are still people, and I’m not an complete asshole. but i’m losing it fast, i need to talk to someone, i need to get out of here, and i can’t find ..much at all, the housing web pages are horrible loops that go nowhere, and due to cicumstances i can’t really chat before midnight,when everything closes. any online live help, advice, links, etc, much appreciated.

Suic-1201,When all is lost....what can you do? Be radical (Part 2),"In part 1 I raised the notion of being radical, indeed any action at all, in avoiding suicidal thoughts or plans. It is 24 years ago I made my one and only attempt on my life, one of my siblings suicided as did an uncle and my sister had an attempt as well. I recall vividly that I had zero vision of anything other than escape. Now, much wiser, more aware and in 2008 a diagnosis of bipolar I’m able to see the warning signs. But there is two assets I possess that will guarantee I will never fall into that well again, they are- 1/ Positive thinking. I’ve attended motivation lectures, read books on how to transform from negative thinking to positive etc. Positive thinking won’t prevent depressive cycles but will help you kick start your life when coming out of those periods. Being a positive person makes recognising negative people easy and one feels sorry for these sad souls that simply don’t enjoy life. 2/ A safety plan. Your own safety plan can be as simply as being radical in actions providing of course you let loved ones know you are ok. A change of immediate environment is a good concept. A walk or if you are ok to do so, a drive to a beach or attend a movie. It’s all about having faith things are bad for a short time only. Once you’ve accepted same and your depressive cycle begins (or triggers), then you’ll be aware of such steps so you can avoid the suicidal path. All this seems ..well, logical but we aren’t logical when on the way to self harm. Now, imagine you are stranded in a small island alone. What would you do in the first 48 hours? Write SOS with rocks on a beach? Make shelter? Find water, food etc. That’s logical yes? Then such survival instincts are automatic- but instincts are absent in us when we are deeply depressed hence the need for a plan. What do you think? Do you have a plan? Does it include important contacts like lifeline, Dads in distress or Beyondblue? Or is it worth avoidance strategies as I’ve mentioned?

Suic-1206,I am trapped inside a box with no way out,"I was diagnosed with MDD and GAD roughly eight years ago during middle school. I have been to 10 or so psychologists in my lifetime and have struggled to connect with them; much life other people. I feel that my interests and values are too esoteric from the norm for someone my age (M/23). I experienced by first relationship in 2018 but due to the impact of my antidepressants I was unable to fully connect to them due to sexual dysfunction (caused by the medication). I have trialed six or so antidepressants to try to find one that doesn't have those side effects and helps me to feel more stable, but my psychiatrist wants me to continue on these ones for another month to see if they get better. The problem is that I will never accept them even if they help me feel better as I will always be missing a part of me that helps me to connect to a future partner. I have violent mood swings where I enter a deep depression and say hurtful things to my family. I think that I'm punishing myself by trying to push them away further and further. My psychiatrist offered a plan b if the current antidepressant won't work and that is to consider mood stabilisers. Since I learnt about them, I have been obsessed to read about them and I have absorbed multiple journals of information about their efficacy and lack of sexual side effects. I really don't know what to do because I emailed my psychiatrist to ask if I can consider jumping straight to the stabilisers but I haven't heard anything. I just really want to feel some relief and stability and I feel this is something I can only achieve with a more powerful medication. I don't have many options except go to the hospital or call 000. I have a psychology session coming up, but I really struggle to connect with others so I am not sure how it will go. Meanwhile, I was prescribed some muscle relaxants to take when the anxiety consumes me. I have been limiting them to two a day. One when I wake up so I can cope with work, and one when I go to bed at 6. I don't know how I can have a normal life. I fantasize about the life I could have the how I could be happy (I nearly have enough money to buy a house, but it becomes worth pushing through less and less each day). - Justin",DeepBlueOceans,Community Member,18-11-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-am-trapped-inside-a-box-with-no-way-out/td-p/519247
Suic-1207,Unsure of the future,"Hi, I am a first timer here. I have suffered with Depression all my adult life and diagnosed with BPD last year. I feel like I am getting worst rather than improving. This year I have been admitted to hospital twice this year because of my depression, I have tried ECT to help but feel like it was unsuccessful. I am currently getting help but feel like no one is listening or understands me. Local agencies have let me down in the past, or signed me off before I am stable. So trusting people and agencies is hard. I keep hearing it will get better but it doesn’t feel like that. I am struggling with my thoughts and especially the willing to keep going. I cannot see a future for me. I go to work each day but have lost my motivation in doing things I previously enjoyed. Everything seems to be a struggle, home, work and life.

Suic-1208,Need help to cope with someone with suicidal thoughts,"Hello everyone, This is my first thread, I am 18 years and I heard from a friend that beyond blue can help assist me any distressing situation, so I ask for help. A year ago, my sister was diagnosed with severe anxiety from bullying in her primary school years, she is 15. We just moved her to a new school where is now has a good friendship group and has expressed to our family that she is happy. However, just recently, my sister tried to take her own life in the middle of the night. I was sleeping until I heard the ambulance with my parents assisting my sister, gladly she is still alive today. When my parents left the house I wondered around to find my parents were finding any sharp objects and chemicals and storing them away. What really disturbed me that night was when I entered my sisters room to find a black painted smiley face on her mirror, at first I didn't know what it was but from my mothers email (I have secret access, I know I shouldn't) I found that it was a suicide note. After she came back, it was really hard to get things back to normal, I was even afraid of looking at my own sister. Now, ever since that night, I have had this constant fear that one day my sister will succeed in her attempt. Every time I hear my sister come out of her room, I remain awake in case I hear anything abnormal or might come to the rescue, every time she heads to the bathroom or hear footsteps in her room. The truth is I don't know what to do or what to say. I have autism and comprehending that my sister was having these thoughts put my life in a mess and living in fear that I may lose my sister. As I said, the truth is I don't know what to do and would really like advice on how to cope.

Suic-1209,Nobody really cares!,"Hi I have posted before about my severe anxiety. Lately it has spiralled out of control (forced lockdown in SA) plus the health symptoms I suffer from constantly. I have been to so many doctors and a psychologist. I try to explain it to my family and the few friends I have. Nobody cares. I am deemed a hypochondriac, a drama queen, too sensitive etc etc. I am the person who would give my last dollar to someone in need. I rescue stray animals and help people whenever I can. Everyone seems to take me for granted. I am totally over this life. The covid shite that keeps us on eggshells constantly. Looking after my teenage son with zero care from his useless father. Looking after my aged mother whilst suffering pain and exhaustion daily. Everyone comes to me with their dramas yet when it is me they all disappear. My friend managed to secure a holiday at her other friends' place when this lockdown was announced. As she is quite happy and having a nice time with company she is off the radar. Yet she often texts me with her dramas and I am always there for her! As I am for everyone! How can I live in this crap place when I get no respect or care from anyone?? I am falling apart mentally and physically and I am not going back to the doctor as I go every week and get palmed off. I don't give a shite if I get covid. I am sick to death of the f'n thing!! I feel there is absolutely nothing to look forward to. I have no partner. My last one was bad news. He contacted me for my birthday and came over for drinks. Big mistake. I get so lonely I will scrape the barrel! He has now blocked me?! I am besides myself as it appears every single damn decision I make is the wrong one! I get more support here than from anyone I actually know. It is a bloody sad and miserable life. Thanks for reading.

Suic-1211,"Pressures from friendships, family and school are making me feel so alone.","Hi, I feel very alone and I feel nobody wants to hear me. I try to talk to my parents as much as I can about everything stupid to important, but they don’t understand or respect my opinion. They always taunt me and they are never satisfied with whatever I do. I can't talk to them about how I feel. They would never show me their affection, they never hug me, or give me a proper response for my special moments or properly spend time with me. They avoid me. I don't have a strong relationship with anyone. I know I am very overweight and extremely ugly, I have to put up with it myself every day of my life. I hate the way I walk, talk and I am dumb in everything I do. So many times I have known the answer or have an idea, but I cannot say it out loud in class. I am fine with sharing things with my friends and sometimes other students in my class, but even with them I feel ignored and alone, as I cannot keep up with things going on in their lives, they all have social media and I don’t and they go all travelling and I have never been out the house except to go to school. Or they simply don’t want to talk to me because of my ugly looks and lack of popularity. There are students in my class who everyone respects because they are good-looking not caring how rude they can be, everyone tells me being beautiful in the inside is more important, but no one cares about being kind. I feel so out of place. I try my hardest to look skinny, I wear clothes that I think will help me do that, I try to keep my things clean and tidy and I try to be nice as much as I can. Nothing works, I always feel the same; alone and stupid. I don’t want any of my friends and family to know about how I feel. But with my parents, my younger brother and my friends ignoring me and making me feel alone, make me think about suicide and I can't sleep during the night or wake up early in the morning. I don’t feel loved, happy or accepted in the people I am surrounded with. I feel weak, alone, misunderstood, ugly, sad, confused and a burden on everyone. I feel confused as I got no idea where I want to work. I feel stupid and sad because my grandma has breast cancer and I haven’t seen her, all I have done is make her miserable, I want to talk to her which I can’t do it through a phone call, because at that moment I don’t want to say and I don't know if she wants to talk to me.

Suic-1213,A few ways to help calm your thoughts down or redirect them.,"I previously posted these ideas in another thread, but I thought I might post them here as well. These are some effective methods I use to help calm down and soothe my thoughts: -As my name and profile suggests, I LOVE foxes. Sometimes I find that a great way to ease my pain is just by looking at pictures of them or adding to my board on Pintrest. We are all different, so even if you are not a fan of foxes, you can still use any other type of animal you find cute. -Pretend that you have a pet. Even if you already have a cat or a dog, think of something more calming and adorable. I am sure it is no suprise that mine is a fox called Lucy. She often likes to cuddle up with me in bed and sometimes tries to steal my food, still cute though. Like I said before, not everybody loves foxes, so just find what suits you best. If you already find that one of your current pets suits you well, then try to have some quality time with them. -Have a shower. I often find that showers can be extremely soothing mentally and physically as it gives me a feeling of breaking free from dirt and bad moods. This may not be the best option in areas with tight water restrictions though... -Make some tea. I often find that a nice cup of tea is the most effective method of relaxing my mind and muscles. Particularly on a cold and rainy day. My ideal cup is some nice strong black tea with a spot of milk and no sugar. Like I would have said before, not everybody is the same, so your ideas may differ. These are just some things that I find helpful.

Suic-1214,Not sure how to stop feeling suicidal,"Hello, I’m new to joining but I’ve heard good things about beyond blue so I thought I’d give it a try. i suffer from severe depression and anxiety and have for about 9 years now. I’m only in my early twenties (yesterday was my birthday lol) so this should be the last thing I feel but unfortunately it isn’t. I’ve recently gotten out of a 7 year relationship it was very toxic and abusive - he cheated and abused me in many ways I’ve come to believe he is some form of a narcissist. I’m glad I got out and I’ve been seeing someone new which has been going well I really like him. But since finding out my last partner has also started to move on its effected my self worth as I did everything to try to make it work and he ended up leaving and will probably do things for her I always asked for. I know this will pass and I see a psychologist often but I still can’t shake the feelings of heaviness and that it would probably be easier for me if I wasn’t her as my hearts so heavy and I’ve gone through so much pain. I’ve never attempted and I don’t think I will anytime soon but the feelings won’t go away and are getting bad again. I wanted to see what people’s best coping mechanisms are besides the generic ones such as exercise and meditation etc. I’m also on antidepressants and have been again for about 2 years - they sort of numb it but not entirely. Any help is appreciated. It would be nice to go a day without feeling empty and sad lol.

Suic-1215,New member who needs help helping a partner,"Hi everyone! I have joined this forum to ask for help with my suicidal boyfriend. Me and my boyfriend have been having issues for months now and I have just today called it quits and broke up with him. He has been suicidal our entire relationship (2 years) and years before we met too. He is a 3 hour drive away from me at the moment, so I don't know what he has near him in terms of self harm tools or anything else which may be harmfull. I am just lost and don't know what to do. Nothing I say seems to get through to him, because he thinks I hate him and am just saying these things so that I don't have a guilty conscience. I love him and always will, my decision to break up never had anything to do with that, but with both of our toxic behavior affecting the other. I guess I am just here as a last resort, I dont know what I can do to stop him from going over the edge, especially being so far away from him and not being able to do anything to make sure his surroundings are safe for him.

I don't even understand entirely how I feel and so if I can't understand it, how am I supposed to be able to explain it? I feel like I just want to disappear. Cease to exist. I don't particularly want to kill myself (in all honesty I think I'm too scared to) but I don't want to be here anymore. But all I think about is death. Dying. However it may happen as long it happens to me. Finally being at peace. I feel worthless and helpless. I have no passions or desires. I'm just constantly scared I guess... and empty at the same time if that makes sense. I feel like I don't belong here and I don't think I really want to. I hate compliments and people telling me I deserve to be here because I'm such a wonderful person with a bright future and so much potential. But they don't really know me. Not like I know myself (and I don't even really know myself. But what I do know, I hate). Truth is I just don't want to be here. I love my family and friends and I am so grateful to have them in my life. They make me happy. But they're just a distraction because when I'm truly alone, I realise just how unhappy I actually am and it scares me. They think I'm ok. Maybe it's because I act ok around them. Whenever someone says what they like about me it's always to do with how contagious my smile/laugh is, my bubbly personality etc etc etc. But I'm miserable on the inside. Always. If they knew what went on in my head... it'd be the shock of the century to them.

Suic-1230,A friend has been self-harming and suicidal.,"Hi all, Just today my friend said if she could speak to me in text on Instagram. I have a small group of friends, 5 girls, and two boys (one of the boys is me). She was sort of the quiet one, but she is pretty funny, she has a best friend in the group, her name is Skye. They have been known to joke around a lot and be really happy, but the hurt one, Pheobe is depressed and told me about her self-harming. She always said, she wanted to kill herself and stuff, we always thought it was kind of a half-joke and she was just sad. I kind of ignored her because I personally find it kind of unfunny and annoying to joke about that stuff. And I regret that. She messaged me when we came back from school this: ""I’ve been self harming again and I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like everyday I get worse and worse and I just wish I had someone to talk to , i can’t tell my dad because he already has enough stuff going on in his life and I don’t want him to worry about me, i don’t know if you’ve noticed but I’ve been clean until like a month ago, i wish I was genuinely happy man."" I'm not to sure what to say to her, I said I'm all ears and tried to tell her that I would listen, we chatted for about 10 minutes and she said she said she wanted to talk at school.

Everyday is a battle against staying here for the sake of my family and pushing through my sad and sorry life. I have no true friends at school and everyone either doesn't know who I am, thanks to my social anxiety and therefore extreme quietness and shyness, or takes the complete piss out of me as a person with their friends. I am sick of living my life. I don't find joy in anything anymore. I have good grades and all but I don't feel proud of who am I am at all. I am sick of being so socially anxious, it truly ruins my life. Thanks to my social anxiety people think I am weird and stay away. I have the worst stutter when I am anxious and it is so dehumanizing when I try to make new friends. No one cares about me and it would make no difference if i am gone or not. I hate myself and my life so much, sometimes I get this feeling that something is crushing my chest I want it all to end so bad. I just want someone to listen and not judge me for these messed up feelings as its not realy something you can just tell anyone who asks if I am okay.

I have two teenage boys, and whilst I love them completely, as they do me, I am constantly at loggerheads with them. (Yes, I know this is normal). I do not have any family in Australia, and my circle of friends is very small, with contact being limited. My only regular conversations are with therapists every week and my GP. My children have little to no contact with their father and have not done for the past almost 5 years, although this has been out of his control for the past two months, as he had a massive heart attack and has suffered a brain injury as a result. (He is currently in a rehab unit- learning how to do everything again). I have lived with manic depression and anorexia all my adult life, and I just can't keep going. As I mentioned I see two therapists regularly and have peer support from a third, and when I tell them how I am feeling, I know they are worried, as am I, but what can they or anyone do? Today, all I hear is ""Just do it. Just go and end it all. The world doesn't need you, it would be better off without you. You are not needed here anymore"", with a few expletives in there too. How can I silence this? Now it's the weekend, and I know if I reach out for help, my children will be taken away, and that cannot happen, but if I stay silent, I am going to go mad!

I had a massive manic depressive episode and almost took my own life and thankfully sent to a hospital and was diagnosed bipolar 1 with adhd. Once I got out my wife couldn’t handle the pressure and lost trust in me as I was so unstable and kicked me out. I have 3 daughters.. this was he hardest thing ever.. and then covid.. this left me without work for 5months from a job I had held a senior role for 11+years and a chef. (No family, no work) I ended up having to get my own place, still can’t find it comfortable without my girls around and I struggle so much dealing with my situation. i”ve since done a time of therapy, balance meds and trying my best yet trying to stay stable is a constant struggle. recently has a lapse and said and felt things that I tried to hard to control and damage has been done. thngs are slowly getting better though, my wife and I are working on the relationship but I can’t stop myself from thinking that it’s still all to much for her and for myself and that I’m a burden (another child she has to attend to) further more I left my job, started a new one and trying to take it as a fresh start but anxiety gets the best of me and my doubts of my ability to sustain any healthy lifestyle is pressure that’s too much. it’s the hardest thing to mange, I get Manic and it feels good like so good but it was so quickly turn ugly if triggered and the speed of which my head can spiral scares the hell outta me. feeling like I should be alone, and not burden those around me with all this. It’s too much and too unpredictable and down right terrifying at times. guess I just want to see if anyone can understand.. relate..

I have BPD and severe depression but I'm sure I have other disorders that are undiagnosed. Perhaps those who try to live are the deluded ones. On the other hand, perhaps this experience will only make me stronger. Emotions can hurt but they are a survival instinct so we can regulate ourselves and our morals.

Suic-1245,Help? Advice needed,"Hello... I need some advice, I have posted to BB before but I needed to get some opinions/ advice on a certain work situation I am in. I am the only LGBT (lesbian) identifying individual at my work place (majority of workplace gender is female) and have fallen for another female co-worker. But she is in a long term relationship (since she was 20). We have developed a really good connection and are good friends, but we both share the same feelings and have met up a couple of times outside of work. I am so terrified and guilty, I have caused problems for her relationship and distracted her from mending things with her partner, I even met them both to keep the peace which was incredibly anxiety-inducing for myself but I thought it was the right thing to do. But now he won’t let her text me and monitors her every move which I completely understand because I feel like I am the catalyst. But she needed a good friend as we work in a rural location and we both don’t have many friends to talk to about this. I feel very overwhelmed, guilty but also angry for her. I don’t know if I just should have kept my feelings to myself? It’s all a bit complicated. We are not allowed to text at all from today and I feel pretty depressed. I think I am a bad person for potentially ruining their relationship (he cheated on her for 3 years but doesn’t make this right either) but all I wanted was to offer friendship at the start but our feelings grew stronger… working together has been difficult too with its ups and downs. I have tried to back off completely and give them space but she keeps returning to me and I also am so drawn to her as we connect really well we just seem to be going in circles but I feel like I may be in dangerous territory now… any advice and please be nice as it’s easier said than done when it comes to being in a situation like this… feelings are so complicated. I’m also terrified this is going to leak out at work and I will potentially be fired/ persecuted and judged or forced to quit. I just want us both to be happy I also suffer from depression and anxiety and it has been affecting my personal life. I can't seem to think about anything else.

Suic-1250,My story,"Hi, I am here posting on this site because I'm not in a good place right now and I sort of feel like I should write my story down and maybe get a better headspace of where to go and what to do. I'm supposed to be meeting my brother to walk to the store later this evening and get some groceries for my first week back at work from having some time off. I'm sorta planning on taking that final step after I get home. Anyways, here's my story. I was born in a country called Zimbabwe and lived there till I was around 12. I never saw or experienced any, what I would call, traumatic events but I was just sort of used to living with burglar bars and parents having to sleep with guns near the bed. My relationship with my dad was good around this time, although he did use corporal punishment to discipline me. The worst was when he punished me when I broke a sliding-door window. We moved to Australia and I had to make new friends at school. The cool kids I wanted to be around weren't interested in doing work and I began to copy them. Dad was in a understandably stressful point in his life and my grades slipping ended up in a lot of hostility between us and in our home. Once during school holidays he got mad at me for changing the channel on the TV and abused me and said some hurtful things. Time passes, I move on but am still hurt about it. I meet a girl online, she lives in Norway and I start online dating with her. She has a hard family life. We used to talk on skype which dad would get angry about for keeping him awake (time zone difference). She was a self harmer and I sort of started doing it as well to express anger. Dad still doesn't know but I stopped several years ago. We were together for a year, I saved up enough from work to visit her. It was a very happy time. She cheated on me once I moved back because she needed the physical part of the relationship. I tried tinder and found a girl and started dating. She was a very bad influence, she got me into drugs, mostly marijuana but I tried harder stuff. I'm clean now. I just smoke cigarettes. She gave me a place to stay after dad man handled me again and I left home. Mom was very upset. The girlfriend moved to SA to live with her mom. I visited her even after she cheated on me.

Suic-1254,Bipolar depression problems,"Hi all, I have gone through a number of bouts of depression and hypomania over the last few months which is believed to be an underlying bipolar 2 which has been caused to emerge when I restarted my antidepressants. I had the worst depression ever about a month ago but with an addition of an antipsychotic plus an increase in a mood stabliser I seem to have finally come out the other side of it. However, I feel as though I am settling into the mood stabliser dose and I can feel the depression edging back. It feels so good to have life almost back to normal, so I am very hesitant to mention anything to my family, because as soon as I do, I am no longer really able to drive, work, get out and just be where I am at right now. During my last depression I was lucky to survive, but I had said to my mum, if my mood gets like this again, I am not making it through, this will be it. Last time there was an overwhelming feeling as if it was just my time to die in life and that it is so much easier than the recovery process. While my mood improved I still believed within that any drops in mood and this would be it. Right now my mood is fine, yet after a tiny bit of stress, I am already planning how to end things. I don’t know what to do and I guess I’m confused how I can feel fine but not want to live as much",Xraychick,Community Member,25-10-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/bipolar-depression-problems/td-p/505912

It's still a day by day proposition. The extension in Melbourne restrictions is taking such a personal toll that I need all the support I can get. Sunday, while actively contemplating my demise, I called a friend. She was also in a very bad way. Somehow, we managed to talk each other out of our states and promise to talk again the next day. Stay around for just one night. Was a rough night, but I had the call the next day I had to make. Since then, I have let my wife know how close I have been. I had been trying to protect her, but was almost unable to protect myself. It has been hard for her, but she is part of the reason I am still here. I have SH in the previous weeks. I had kept that from my wife as she is also struggling in these times. I feel for those that do not have a close and supportive family. Especially those in Melbourne at the moment. It is a daily struggle not to SH again. With help from family and friends I may succeed. Not being able to meet with friends is crushing.

I adore her and have cried and cried so much, however I am getting better with coping and only breakdown occasionally and always in private. It’s so hard because on one hand I know how exhausted and tired she is, and on the other hand it looks as if she’s giving up, by not wanting to eat or do anything. I feel guilty at times because of the frustrating circumstances, I am realistic and know she has to die one day, but I know she doesn’t want to go yet. She is living with me at present with the hope she can go home ASAP. I am also exhausted, with 3 jobs, looking after her and the rest of the family and also all the work required to keep a household going, ie: cooking, cleaning etc. The other problem is she doesn’t want anyone else to know what’s going on, my family think she‘s having treatment for a benign condition, I don’t have anyone to be there for me and it looks like I’m being a spoilt brat when I say how exhausted I am. I don’t even know what I want or need from this forum, maybe just a way of venting my feelings and experiences. I will be by her side no matter what throughout this journey, but I’m worried now ,(after today, a particularly hard day), about my mental health, I did feel an urge to go down a familiar path of self harm to help me cope.

Suic-1259,"Trudging Along -  Passive Suicidal Ideations, even after evaluation","I have been struggling for a few years now, but over the past year i have developed depression and anxiety. Been seeing a therapist and talking to my GP. Over the past 6 months I have been experiencing passive suicidal ideations. Passive suicidal ideations being me not wanting to live but not wanting to take action. They have been progressively becoming more severe. I struggle with symmetry and cleansliness ocd, and i have certain schemas that cause me to always focus on the past and future, and how my decisions will affect my oppourtunities. I always overthink every decision, i also focus on the bad parts of every situation, which can me feel bad even when things are going okay overall. There do seem to good times but when i am in a bad headspace or something the feelings are so strong. You may be wondering what i mean in the title by ""even after evaluation"". By this, i mean i have hope and expectations for a better future, but I dont think its worth getting to. Its not uncommon for me to think 'The things i want to experience in life are not worth the things i have to experience to get there'. In this situation, i am so glad I overthink decisions and fear missing out on oppourtunites, as it keeps me from taking action. But while i dont take action, the feelings i have are so strongly that i dont want to live. Even with me not wanting to take action, i recently walked to a highway and stood there for 10 minutes thinking about if i should lie down on the road.

Suic-1263,"1 step forwards. 2 back. Health, guilt and self harm","Hi everyone. I am pretty new here. Just looking for a bit of support as I feel I can’t turn to my family and friends. Growing up, from an early age, I strangely had a lot of friends die through cancer or other illness. I had an eating disorder for most of my early 20’s. Then a benign health condition that I have had for years (which was incorrectly diagnosed as panic attacks, but ended up with me fainting regularly and having a procedure on my heart) left me with anxiety and depression like I have never felt in my life. To be honest it’s not I even that bad of a condition to have in the scheme of things (fainting is not normal) + it’s actually quite common. But my family/friends never really seemed to care. I was told nothing was wrong and to get over it so many times. It took doctors over 10 years to diagnose. I have heard of other people having the same condition and getting diagnosed straight away. And even have seen family members of people I know with the same (untreated) condition get so freaked out and worried and cry, which worries me because I feel like it must be really bad. This has led to me freaking out over everyone’s health. If someone mentions something I wrong - particularly with their heart I go into full panic mode. I feel so anxious I could throw up. My legs feel like jelly and I can’t focus on anything but that. And I become convinced that someone is going to die. I spend so much time lying awake thinking about how I wish I could trade places with that person and bear so that they don’t have to. I wish so hard that I could make it better for them but I can’t and end up taking it out on myself through self harm. I feel so guilty that my health condition was treated when others aren’t, either through choice or because they can’t I have recurring nightmares. I don’t understand why I am still here when others aren’t. This was almost 3 years ago that it all started and I feel like I just can’t move on. Especially when I get drunk (which is very rare!) I start getting urges to self harm and panic like crazy. My poor husband has been so amazing but I feel like he can’t take me like this forever. I have been seeing a psychologist which is helping. I am on medication (but am backing off it as we are wanting to have a family), and I have been trying to meditate and journal every day.

Can't fault my doctor or my wonderful wife. Unfortunately things at Emergency were not ideal, long wait but I can understand that but there opinion was at complete odds which my doctor, I was made to feel like I was just after attention and sympathy [what I really wanted was definitely not attention, I wanted to be alone but wifey wasn't going to let that happen] so the upshot was I would not be admitted and was sent home, now here is the irony part, from what I understand, just say hypothetically if my wife had found me trying to make good on my wishes, and remember I'm not after sympathy so I wouldn't want anyone interfering or carting me off, but say my wife called 000, my understanding is as I am now a threat to myself I would be forcibly taken and admitted and not able to discharge myself, so in 1 day I could be refused entry into the ward and later that same day forced into the very same ward unable to get out, makes you think, makes you laugh, could even make you cry.

I'm not sure why this is. I see life moving so fast; like a treadmill that you can't step off and it gets faster and faster. Suppose you take birds-eye view of the planet; I see humans going about their business, most of them having kids that grow up to have more kids. Commuting to work. Eating food. Then death occurs. I suppose these thoughts make me nihilistic. I don't believe in anything in particular in terms of after death. Definitely not organised religion. Maybe nothing happens when we die. I do find it odd that life would occur at all if there was no purpose to it, though. Occasionally my mind wanders to ways I could end my life. It is these kind of thoughts that are worrying me. Having shared that, I do get enjoyment out of life. I have a great family and friends, I exercise, before covid I travelled a lot, I am lucky to amazing love in my life, and I have a career that I enjoy. These things distract me from my bleak thoughts. However, loved ones in my life dying seems to inordinately preoccupy me. I am 31 and I think these thought have been occurring off and on for about 5 years. The frequency is increasing. I'm not sure what else and it is really difficult to put my thoughts into words.

The first referral was lost....she waited 8 months to hear back from them. Yes, she tried call them during that time and there was no one in the office. Possibly due to Covid, she thought maybe they're not working at the moment. When she finally got through 8 months later, they had lost her referral. Actually, they said they never received it, which she knows isn't true, because she had discussed over the phone with her and said the psychiatrist had the information about it on his desk!! She then called another GP, got another referral to a different psyciatrist. They were going to get back to her. She's heard nothing for weeks. Two weeks ago she was taken to hospital by ambulance because she wanted to kill herself. The H.O.P.E. team (post suicide attempt assistance) are supposed to be helping her.....they're 'going' to call her back. What is it....they wait until she kills herself before they attempt to do anything. I really angry. She is suffering, her 3 young children are suffering and the rest of our family are suffering.

Suic-1268,Victim of covert narcissist,"i have been unwell. It was supposed to just a cold but i've been very ill. It was during that illness that i had a mind of revealation, the bubbie burst so to speak. My wife partner (de facto) of 40 years said something personal and cruel to me while i was sick. I was so shocked i broke free of the bubble i'd been living in for 40 years. How could anyone say something like that to someone so ill. But she is a EN enrolled nurse so it made it all the more hard to understand. but it's nothing new. i had a duodenal ulcer rupture many years back when i was about 40. we'd been to the beach. I thought i hurt my back. I laid on the floor, but as always she implied i was exaggerating. I never understood that. I was in a lot of pain. I was laying on the living room floor. She turned the tv and sat back to watch it, ignoring me. I realised how ill i was and asked for an ambulance . when i got out of hospital a week or two later i came home. She told me she was moving out today. We had a little girl together. They moved out and left me on my own. You can imagine how weak i was. It took a long time to recover. I lived off canned soup. there were also many times she went out and didn't come home. She felt she didn't have to explain. She gaslights me, I blamed myself. I was drawn into this hook line and sinker. I'd never heard the the term covert narcissist you have the picture now i'm sure. There's so much more as you could imagine. she turned all my friends against me over the years. i had no one. I was lost inside myself too. I believed i was worthless. i was to blame for her behaviour because i was worthless. im still not over the so called cold, rhinovirus. ive been back and forth to doctors and the hospital for a cracked rib. I'm so depleted. I haven't left my room for 5 weeks except to get something to eat. She's just sitting in the lounge watching tv. i am thinking i have the right to end my life at 70. Or i could move out on my own and rent a house somewhere. I feel terrible loneliness and sadness. Ive just never been good at living just for me. Renting a house on my own , living my remaining years on my own has always been my worst fear. i just came here to see what others might contribute, suggest, what other options are there.

Suic-1274,Shouldn't I be happy?,"Hi, I'm a male in my early 50's, married with two teenage sons and reasonably well paying job but life just seems a never ending battle. I'm the only earner for the family and I'm paying two mortgages and we're always just scraping by. There's never any money for anything other than just getting by. I've ended up in a management position at work that I didn't ever really want but took anyway to have a bit more job security. At times I feel that the weight of the world is on my shoulders and I don't know how much longer I can keep going. I guess I do suffer from depression and sought help in the past. To be honest it didn't help. I sleep about 4 to 5 hours a night and went to my GP for help with this. Unfortunately his solution for any medical issue seems to be to prescribe pills which is what I got. They didn't help so his answer was to increase the dose that didn't help. I can't afford to go back to the GP so don't know where to turn for help. I've tried discussing how I feel with my wife and how our financial situation is killing me but she's not interested. Over winter I got to the point of almost ending my life so the pain would be over. I've told this to my wife and her reaction was simply unbelievable. She told me that people who commit suicide are just selfish cowards who leave everyone else behind to clean up the mess! She just doesn't have any idea of how depression works. I didn't put my hand up and say I want to feel so low, so worthless that taking my own life is the only way out. I've tried suggesting that we sell one of our properties so we're only paying one mortgage. She wouldn't even consider this as apparently I would just fritter the money away! Well, perhaps it might take some strain off me. So I really don't know what to do. I feel that I can't even provide properly for my family and feel bad if I were to ever even dream of having some sort of holiday or a hobby. There are a lot of people worse off than me so why shouldn't I be happy with what I've got? I sometimes harm myself I get so frustrated. The pain helps me carry on. In my 20's and 30's I flew hang gliders. I was really good at flying and it took away all my feelings of low self esteem. I gave up flying 20 years ago and I've bee trying to return to the sport the last 5 years now. I've no idea how though as in my situation it just seems a impossible dream. Maybe I am just selfish and should forget any idea of wanting to do something for ME?

Thoughts to remove myself from existence has come and gone. and its usually just the 3 ways that I would do it. however I always feel too week/scared to attempt. rather than doing that I use/do certain things to make me feel better for the short instant moments.

Suic-1276,Chronic pain,"Hi guys, I’ve recently been diagnosed with adjustment disorder due to ongoing psychological trauma since the age of 16, although I honestly though I had it all handled and was doing well, apparently that’s not the case. I’ve been suffering with intense shoulder pain (my muscles feel rock hard) which then causes neck pain and like a domino effect causes me to have headaches at the back of my head. My doctor had prescribed me muscle relaxers and anti inflammatories but they even done nothing. Last night I took myself to the ER because the pain got so bad, I was given endone and sent on my way (still in pain). I just don’t know where to go to from here? I’m seeing a psychologist for talk therapy but I can’t continue to suffer through the physical symptoms. Last night I kept having this reoccurring thought that if I couldn’t get rid of this pain I was going to kill myself. I know the sounds like a drastic measure but I can’t handle the pain. Had anyone dealt with chronic pain? How do you get doctors to take you seriously and stop pushing pills that don’t work?

Suic-1278,Work situation,"Hi, I have been posting about my work situation. I have much more work than I can get through, and work up to 16 hours a day. I am exhausted. Had a helper at one stage but I was still in the same situation of having way too much work and I got annoyed at her work ethics and reacted to that, and it made the treatment I get at work much worse, I can tell people hate me. I am working the really long hours to try my best not to get fired, but the workload and hours I am doing make me want to die to get out of the torture. I have spoken to many people at work about the workload and will eventually get a small amount of help, but I don't think it is going to be much help and I don't think my situation is going to change. I have recently bought a house on my own and have a mortgage. Whilst I would like to change jobs and get myself out of this situation, I can't do it. I will never be able to find another job that will pay well enough to be able to keep my house, and all throughout my life, I just struggle to support myself. I am stupid and people hate me. It is very difficult for me to get a job and keep a roof over my head. I think I am in a lot of trouble and if I do choose to live through this, I may be facing homelessness and all kinds of horrible things. I have started making a plan to end it for a few weeks away as I don't want to live like this. If I could support myself everything would be fine, but I can't, I am stupid and unlikeable. I am still putting in some attempt to try to get through this, I have just registered online with am employment agency for people with a disability, and have started to look into franchises, although I don't think I would be able to get a franchise for quite some time as in August I had a first seizure and am now not allowed to drive until Feb next year.

Suic-1281,Lost and tired of not being able to stop worrying,"I feel so lost and clueless. I’m halfway though a degree I’m not sure I want to do anymore for a career I’m not sure I’m suited for. I’ve talked to a career counsellor, program advisor and the people in charge of the different majors but I still feel as clueless as I was before. I’m failing my classes not because I can’t complete them but because I can’t get myself to do anything. I’ve been seeing the mental health nurses since last year and a psychologist since the end of last year. It feels like nothing has really been helping, which is mostly my fault. I stopped doing progressive muscle relaxation exercises after being really frustrated and unable to calm down. I know that its not the point of doing the exercises, but I can’t clear my mind enough to go through with them anymore. I only started walking again recently after stopping 2-3 months ago. I can’t get myself to change when everything feels pointless and meaningless. The psychologist says I need to just focus on living in the moment, but I can’t get myself to stop worrying about the future and jobs and careers and university and everything. I can’t figure out what to do, looking at future career pathways only stresses me out more and I can’t see myself being happy or enjoying or tolerating anything. I don’t know what to do and theres not much I can do about it without trying things but I can’t spend my whole life failing university courses over and over like im doing now. I can’t do anything right. I need to sleep earlier but I can’t stop worrying. I spend too much time in my room but there’s nowhere for me to go besides walking in the afternoon. There’s too much I need to be doing but im not doing anything. I don’t remember what worked and if medication did anything. I don’t think I can be happy with life. Getting to do what you want feels like a luxury that you need to work for but I don’t really want what I used to want anymore. I don’t get myself to do anything because it feels like the end result will be the same. I’m tired of regretting things.

Suic-1282,Low,"Tonight I'm so lost. My husband and I separated in jul- still in the same house though. And honestly it's probably 100% my mental health that has caused that. I'm so scared that one day I'm not going to be able to fight anymore. I truly believe that my daughter will be better off without me. Truly. I don't want to mess her up and cause her the pain that my parents caused me. Even though she is my everything and biggest reason to stay here, she's also a reason I think I should go. And that scares me. I think if I prep for it enough I can ensure that she always feels loved and doesn't believe it's her fault and has an understanding of how hard I fought. But the thought of her heartbreak still stops me. But I'm so worried that one day that will be too strong. I don't know how to cope. I have a high pressure job that seems to be the only thing keeping me afloat. Without my job I have no self worth, it's the only time I feel somewhat competent in my life and I do important work. With a separation I don't know what the future looks like. I need to book in for supports but don't really know how to do that. I don't have the time and I know that sounds stupid, buy I really don't. I'm also really terrible at getting help when I need it. I struggle to make the call, really struggle. My husband used to help with this this obviously that's out now. I feel so guilte I had and vowed never to let happen. I feel like a failure and so much shame. Also knowing that it's my mental health that would have caused it. All me. I don't know how I'll even feel remotely ok anymore. I feel like I can count in my hands the number of times I've felt actual happiness in my life so have gotten used to just feeling ok, but I can't even see a way back to that. I feel so so so sad and empty. My thoughts of suicide have increased so much and I considered calling the ambulance or driving to hospital tonight. But I don't know what they would do. I've never ever been completely honest about the level of my suicide thoughts due to fear of repercussions. I'm also stuck in a year long cycle of self-harm. I don't know how to talk to anyone about it because I'm so embarrassed.

At this moment, I’m missing a day of school, and have 2 assignments overdue that I haven’t even started. People tell me to do my work, but I feel so tired and my brain can’t focus. I go to an expensive school, so I feel like I should work, but I have no motivation to do so. I want to go to a public school, but my dad is against it. I shouldn’t be going to such a good place when I’m not even making any use of it. I don’t deserve to go there. I used to consider cutting myself with a blade, but I was always to cowardly to do it. I hated myself for being unable to do it. Instead, I burned myself. This was earlier this year. A few weeks ago, my cat broke a glass, and I didn’t have the motivation to clean it, so it put the glass in a drawer, since they were going to try and play with it if i didn’t. When I went to throw it out, I paused. The prices were medium sized, and they looked sharp. I kept a piece, and threw the rest out. I ran it across my arm, and for the first time, I made myself bleed. I found it kind of funny, to be honest. I didn’t do it because I was sad at that moment, I just wanted to see myself bleed. I still have it, and I still use it. I even drew on myself with the blood, again finding it humorous. at school, I get the urge to damage myself. Being around people makes me feel bad. I don’t really know how to describe it. I am very introverted. I sharpen my pencil and scratch my arm during class, not enough to bleed, but almost. I don’t want to see a therapist. I don’t think I do, anyway. I can’t imagine asking my dad for one. As I said before, I have no reason to feel sad. I don’t really deserve to feel sad. It’s probably just because I’m weak. People have it so much worse, and yet they are fine. They work hard. So why am I so selfish to feel like this? I have a lot of things. I have a parent, a friend, a good school, a house and more. Why am I so ungrateful? I don’t feel suicidal. I just often feel like I’m done with being conscious, and want to go home and do nothing. I want to just stare at a wall or read. I don’t know if I need help. I don’t feel like I do, but’s seeing my sisters face when she sees me scratching myself with my nails, I wonder if i do.

Suic-1287,"Isolated, lonely and hopeless",Hi everyone. My life has been a disaster for a very long time since a least 2011. I've been extremely isolated and lonely for many years now. I've had friends but lost them all to drugs. For a time I purposely isolated myself for safety because I just wasn't meeting good people. I moved last year and have struggled to meet new people where I'm living. I attempted suicide in January but immediately called an ambulance. I have type one bipolar disorder and this past couple months I've been hypomanic relapsing a couple times and engaging in increasingly risky behavior. In the last week I was involved in two car accidents the second time I totalled my car. Luckily nobody was injured. I couldn't face telling my parents so was planning to have the car towed then go home and end it but realized I wasn't safe and called an ambulance on myself. Spent the night in hospital. Appointments tomorrow with my GP and Psychiatrist but know that loneliness and isolation are my biggest problem and I don't know what they can do to help me.

Suic-1288,A Newbies' Story & Seeking support,"Three years ago, I tried to commit suicide. I went to the hospital and they held me there and since then I've been afraid of any health services. I won't go to a doctor, or psychiatrist. After that incident I turned my life around, I vowed to outlive everyone. I lost a lot of weight, got fit. Moved out, got a job and a boyfriend. He had to hold my hand to go to a medical test to apply for the job, because I turned pale would have refused to go otherwise. My boyfriend has noticed that roughly once a month I spiral into a deep depression for a couple days. Two months ago, after one of those spirals, he looked through my phone & found history of me researching suicide methods. By the time he'd seen that, I was already out of that mood (Having not acted on it) and had forgotten about doing it. He knew about my past, and I do have a very infrequent habit of self-harm. But this has caused a huge break in our relationship which I don't know if we will recover from, though we are trying. He thinks I have bipolar due to the mood swings which since then have become more intense. He is supportive but distant, which has made me feel more alone. Since that break in my relationship, and Covid making every interaction with strangers at work or on the streets or keeping me home-bound, has made me isolated & even more depressed. My phobia means that I am limited in how I can seek help for my feelings. I don't want to be diagnosed, due to stigma, the fear of hospitalization and an unwanted potential familial link. I don't want my name to be on some file in an office somewhere with my personal thoughts, feelings, history; No matter how confidential they are promised to be, I know that they can be subpoenaed, accessed by other staff, or forwarded for referral. Because of these, I'm wary to open to up to anyone, particularly with the threat of hospitalization looming over me if I even mention suicide. So I feel I can't be completely honest in those circumstances. There is also the fact that the psychologists there were strangers (Online is different, I feel protected by my anonymity), with the power to keep me from going home; I felt they were placating my distress, with a facade of understanding and sympathy when they held all the power. So, what can I do? I don't want to undo all of the good I've done in the last three years but I can't control how I've been feeling. Are there alternatives to traditional psychiatry/therapy? I thought this forum might be a place to start,",HiveMind,Community Member,23-07-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,9,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/a-newbies-story-seeking-support/td-p/480127
Suic-1289,thank you for reading,"Hello everyone, I'm Harry. At the time of typing this I'm finding it hard to put all of my problems on the table. I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for about 3-4 years and it's mainly because of school, and it has affected other aspects of my life, such as being social with people and having motivation to do the things I love. At some points in the last few years I've felt that I don't want to be alive anymore, I've felt worthless, but I was and still am too scared to do it, but not because people care about me, but I'm scared of dying (how ironic). I've tried counselling which didn't help me at all, and I've visited a psychologist in the recent months but due to complications of the pandemic, it has been hard to visit again. I may be 16 turning 17 and still have so much of my life to live for, but I also have my mind circulating the fact that I will be alone for a long time. I honestly believe that the concept of a relationship is a beautiful thing; two people that have each other's back and also understand each other. As I mentioned, there's still so much time for that, but with the feelings I'm experiencing, I can't help but envy the happiness that one experiences in a relationship.

Suic-1290,Tick all the boxes but still empty,"A few events lately have meant that I’ve fallen really low within myself and struggling daily with the thoughts in my head. I’m not someone who talks about feeling or emotions. But a few things happened that made me question myself. I’ve realised that for at least the past 20 years I don’t actually don’t feel emotions like everyone else. I don’t get excited because I might get let down. I don’t feel happy even when it should be a happy occasion (a wedding). But then I don’t feel overly sad in times that I should ( a funeral). It’s like I’ve built up my walls to protect myself but it means I don’t feel anything. I’ve gone on holidays to places people would love but I don’t feel anything and just take photos in the hope that I can enjoy it later at another time when I get home. same for all aspects of my life. I just am not really living in the moment. Like I’m an observer of my own life. It’s hard to explain. And I’ve suddenly had a moment where I realise that maybe I’m missing out on something? Maybe I don’t fully feel emotions. I rarely laugh or enjoy things. Even when I know I should be. I play with my kids and go through all the motions but I just don’t feel happiness. I tick all the boxes for happiness. I have no logical reason for not being happy (have a job, house, kids). I keep busy to keep me distracted from dropping too low. If I don’t keep distracted then I’m in a pretty bad place. Now that I finally have realised this (that I don’t feel emotions) I’m second guessing my decision making ability. Which is perhaps triggering some emotions that I’m not sure I’ve felt properly before (true guilt ?). My brain struggles to comprehend all this and the only thing that makes me feel something or ground me, is to harm myself. It sounds bad when I write it. But I know it’s not right. But it’s like thats some kind of release or someway to punish myself for letting myself feel some emotions ? I don’t know. I’m not trying to kill myself. I’ve hurt myself a few times over the past month. It seems to help me but I know it’s not right. I have a great job and I’m worried people will start to question me about my injuries. I did go to the doctor about 7 weeks ago and she gave me medication. Could the antidepressants be making me worse ? (I have hurt myself before but many years ago ).

The boss didn't really believe I had concussion because my head did not look like it had been beaten around enough. Then a few months later, my wife demanded a divorce, we are fighting custody, and then I lost my job with the coronavirus. We've sold our matrimonial home, my wife, funded by her mum, has a new home, I am still looking. I don't think I can afford to buy, and if I rent I figure I will be bankrupt in under 10 years. My financial advisor agrees. I have lost all motivation. I've worked damned hard, very hard, very long hours since I was 20, now I am 63 and I feel like I have lost it all. Despite all of the anti-depressent and mood stabilising medication I am on, I find myself crying frequently. Mainly when I think of shared custody of my 14 year old twins. They want to spend most of their time with mum, why spend time with dad when he is so depressed so often, that's not much fun. Come night the depression gets worse being alone, and still don't get to sleep until 2 am. I am lost, and have constant negative thoughts. I'm tired and with Covid restrictions I am so lonely. It's so hard to keep going. I'll stop now, the drink is depressing me but it is also putting me to sleep. I feel so empty, a completefailure, 63 years and I end up here. With nothing, and shared custody of my kids, but without a financial capacity to in any way match the gifts my wife and her family will shower on them. at 18 she buys her grandchildren a car each, and then she takes them overseas for extended trips, months.

Suic-1299,I need your advice,"Hello! So I need some advice. I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a long long time and the past couple months have been no different. It's been a really rough couple months, and judging by the news I got today, it's about to get a heck of a lot harder. What I need advice with is, I basically live a double life. I have me, i'mbadwithnames, and then I have ""online me"", let's call them... idk i'mbadwithnames2 (there is a reason why I chose that name...) I am a massive follower of sports, and ibwn2 is my way of interacting with those communities. From watching streams of the players on Twitch when they stream, to interacting with the teams and players on Twitter. A lot of people in the community know my name and I have developed a little following with a lot of people that interact with me. The thing is, ibwn2 is a very positive force on the community. A lot of the people I follow... aren't well liked. I basically exist to tell them that they are talented and welcomed members of the community and to provide a juxtaposition to all the hatred they get every day from being online all the time. (They aren't hated for being bad people, most of them are very nice and a lot of fun to be around, they are just on teams maybe someone doesn't like or that isn't doing well or someone doesn't like the organisation their team exists and plays under ectect.). As you can see, this is a pretty big juxtaposition to actual ibwn who can barely make it through the day without curling up in a ball and crying off to sleep. The question I have, should I introduce i'mbadwithnames2's community to actual i'mbadwithnames? It kind of feels like I am playing them and betraying them by not being authentic, but at the same time I enjoy seperating the two because it means I can be on social media and forget about how awful my life and mental health is and just be someone completely different, arguably better, person. But at the same time, maybe online community wants to know so they can help me? I don't really have an in person support system so I get most of my ""support"" from online friends, a couple of which know how much I am struggling. But a lot of my little community (god it feels egotistical to call them ""my community"") don't actually know. They never get to peek behind the curtain of positivity. As mentioned, I got some bad news today so being that positive person is likely about to become harder. What do you guys think? Any thoughts and opinions would be appreciated.",imbadwithnames,Community Member,20-07-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-need-your-advice/td-p/477451

Suic-1301,I don't belong,What am I doing here. I don't belong here. I don't feel like I have a place on this earth anymore. Why you ask? Because of dissociation. I've been switching from really young ages to my current age for almost a straight month. I've bounced around from caring for my younger parts to now been back to hurting and destroying them and myself. I love my counsellors they are great. I am going through so many issues and problems I keep feeling like a heavy burden towards them I bother them too often I'm not their only client I never have a good day or week to report back to them in any sessions anymore. They've suggested and offered the mental health crisis team whom I've had contact and used before. It's just that with the dissociation and switching ages and what I went through in the past I am absolutely terrified to be locked away. One of my counsellors have suggested a retreat for respite or utilise a hospital stay. I can't. I'm scared. I want to talk but at the same time not talk. I feel all blocked up I feel like I am shutting myself down. I'm slipping I know I am this time right now a part of me doesn't care if I'm alive or not nor do I care how badly I am hurting myself or the harm and risk I put myself in.,Kombie390,Community Member,19-07-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,11,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-don-t-belong/td-p/476516
Suic-1302,Taking things out on myself,"Hello. I’m not really sure why I’m posting this, I guess maybe to feel less alone about it. Also want to clarify that I’m safe and am not about to kill myself or anything. I see a counsellor (though have lapsed a bit with covid stuff happening) who diagnosed me with anxiety/depression ages ago. It has taken me a really really long time to even begin to accept that, and often I still don’t believe it, because I haven’t had anything very devastating happen to me in life. I have a good life. I feel almost like I must be putting it on to get attention or feel ‘special’, and I don’t trust my own thoughts about it. I’m just weak. So many people have it so so much worse than I. I find it impossible to accept myself making any sort of mistake. I feel totally worthless and stupid when I do something (anything) wrong and get strong urges to punish myself by self harming. Sometimes I go through with it, sometimes I don’t. This is the main reason I hurt myself- because I feel like I deserve to feel pain because of what a screw-up I am. I had a period of a couple years where I didn’t hurt myself (don’t know how I did it, it just died off for a bit?) but recently it’s started again sometimes. Does anyone who does this know of a way to channel the urge to hurt yourself into some other thing? I know it’s often said that you should try and distract yourself through grounding techniques but often when I’m in that place, the urge to punish myself is too strong. I just want to take things out on myself. Thank you",venn1,Community Member,19-07-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,2,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/taking-things-out-on-myself/td-p/476392
Suic-1303,Suicidal thoughts due to feelings of loneliness,"Just over a year ago, I found out that my wife had been raped just before I proposed to her. That was over 10 years ago and she kept it a secret until I accidentally found out. Somehow she has managed to move on and gotten on with life. After the initial revelation, things sort of got back to normal but inwardly I have found it very difficult to cope because she refused to acknowledge the rape. She said that calling it rape gave the guy too much power but this makes me think she cheated on me. She doesn't want to talk about it, and since she is the primary victim I respected that. However, I felt very lonely so I confided in a number of people. I felt that getting different perspectives from a number of people helped me to understand her better. Recently my wife found out I had confided in my cousin who is a younger female. My wife was upset about this but I'm not sure why. She said it was okay for me to talk, but only to specific people. I didn't think it fair that she wants to vet and approve the people I confide in, especially since she's made it clear they are my issues and not hers. She's made it clear that she doesn't want to talk about the incident with me, but I often feel the need to talk. Anyway, that sort of lead me to an episode of feeling like suicide is a good option since it appears I can't do anything right. The episode has since passed and I'm not feeling this way anymore. I've done a bit of counselling but I find this a bit difficult to do since we have a young family to look after. But how do I look after myself if I have no one to talk to? I understand that my wife may feel like her privacy is being violated but I generally don't discuss the details of the incident with other people, only where I'm at.

Suic-1307,MY STORY HOW I AM BEATING DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE.,"In 2017 I decided to became a Beyond Blue volunteer speaker. I went to the day course that teaches how to present yourself and how to tell your story. After a short while and a few drafts, I had my presentation sorted. When I got my first date I practiced my presentation. It went like this: There were a lot of people in the room. I told my story and you could hear a pin drop. I was so nervous that the dark shirt I was wearing was obviously wet with perspiration. Later I was told there were 120 people. “I know when my downfall started – it started when I was sexually abused I was 13. I thought I escaped those people when I chose to lock those thoughts away, to be forgotten. My wife always knew there was something wrong and could never put her finger on it. I never talked about the abuse as I had buried it. In 2015 work got really difficult. In hindsight I was being bullied. My boss at the time approached me on a Friday at about 4pm. He asked ‘Is something wrong? I opened up just a little, telling him things I never told my wife. After a few minutes the boss nodded and proceeded to dress me down about something I did earlier in the week?! This just sent me into a tailspin like I got shot out of the sky. Things just got worse, and that in itself brought up memories of when I was young and many other memories. I just fell in a heap. I tried to cope with the thoughts for a few months and attempted suicide twice. It was then I was battling the devil and angel in my head. I put my hand up to get help from a psychologist. One night in Feb 2016, after a really bad day at work, I was racing,bicycle racing, and halfway through the race I broke down. I pulled off the track and I just wanted to end it, there and then. A kind old man saw what was happening and talked to me for over half an hour to not take my life. I could not cope with the pain in my head. Since then I have had a tattoo on my right calf muscle. It is a semicolon with the ying/yang symbol in it. The meaning is – life does not stop here, it continues on. I now have my ups and downs, but I have my cycling and my family to keep me positive. When you get desperate you know how many real friends you have. In all I tried six times to take my life. But I have become a lot happier within myself now and other people have noticed that I am happier too. With the help of a psychologist I was able cope through the early days of my depression and suicidal thoughts and attempts. I resisted to take medication for my illness in these early days BUT just in the last eight weeks I decided to take medication. My wife and other people have noticed a difference. Mental illness is real but it can be beaten. There are signs that we all see but choose to ignore. Unlike a broken leg you can see the plaster and the lack of ability to walk, mental illness has behavioral signs. We have only scratched the surface of the awareness of mental illness and I hope in some way this has helped the reader to learn and to become aware of some of the signs of depression.",Obsessed,Blue Voices Member,16-07-2020,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,3,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/my-story-how-i-am-beating-depression-and-suicide/td-p/474218
Suic-1308,Confused looking for support,"Hello Since a child I have had depression and anxiety. My dad was not mentally stable and would often use violence out of anger without explaining why or what I had done wrong. I developed severe OCD to cope, where I couldn't walk into a room or take a shower without doing some type of repetitive behaviour. I was bullied in primary and high school, so dropped out half way through year 9. I tired my year 10 and HSC at TAFE twice then my mother passed away when I was 15. The next few years where spent in psychiatric hospitals and with eating disorders/self harm. I went back to TAFE for more courses, only to be sexually assaulted by a teacher a couple of times. I have reported this to the police since. My older sister became very violent towards me and especially my father and continues to threaten him with violence so she can get money/valuables off him. She's academically bright, is starting a PHD and is extremely cunning at manipulation. I keep a healthy distance from her. I got into a relationship with a controlling, violent man for 4.5 years after turning 19. He hit me on a few occasions, I lost contact with my friends and my self esteem plummeted. Our relationship was very toxic. Over the course of a day, I packed up the flat we shared and my dad helped me move my stuff out. By now my dads temper had calmed down a lot. I moved work places, as my ex also worked at the same place as me. I worked as a postal worker and stupidly got involved with a guy and his friends who were hard core into drugs. He ended up leaving me, which probably saved my life and ganged up on me at work. It was time to leave when they started jeopardising my safety and tampering with my motorcycle. Cut a long story short, I lived on my own for a few months while slowly running out money, realised living by myself was a bad idea and moved in with some long time family friends who lived in a rural area. They where very loving and supportive. Living with them was hard and I found myself crying a lot. One of the girls was in a happy relationship and I wondered if I would ever experience a healthy, loving relationship. I recently moved to Perth knowing only 1 other person. I've found a supportive GP and psychologist. I practice breathing exercises, joined a martial arts studio and have an unstable job in a supermarket, so looking for cafe work. I feel like people are out to hurt me and am battling suicidal thoughts most days. They are very intense.

Suic-1309,Intrusive thoughts,"For the past two years I've been dealing with intrusive thoughts about suicide. Like a pesky fly buzzing around the room on good days, like a swarm of flies armed with clubs and bludgeoning my head in on bad days. Sometimes it's because I forgot to buy orange juice, other times because I worry that I said something that might make my friends not like me anymore. Sometimes there's just no obvious reason. It's like an automated, scheduled reminder of how messed up my head is. I don't think I actually want to die. There are many things I love about being alive, like music, D&D, and my friends. Sometimes I feel like life is a sham, and I just get tired of it all, but ultimately I want to keep going because I do have things to live for. It's so isolating, though. How do you talk about having daily suicidal thoughts when you're not really that suicidal? I feel guilty about making people worried about me, so I haven't told anyone except my psychologist and strangers online (like you all ). But I don't want to keep it all in anymore. I think I want to tell one of my friends about it, someone who's sort of going through something similar and who'd get it instead of freaking out.

My birthday is in a few weeks but I feel hopeless that I won't make it to 24. I've been depressed since I was about 14 years old, but things got severe when I was 18-19. I started self harming and kept it hidden so no one knew. I feel ugly, stupid, worthless and not good enough. One night when I was 19 a family member found me crying in my room self-harming and contemplating suicide and I had to start going to hospital/therapy. I've stayed overnight in hospital a few times, and was admitted to a psychiatric ward for a month when I was 20. I've struggled with alcohol dependency and binge drinking because it cleared my mind, but it caused a lot of problems and regrets. Things had gotten better and 8 months ago I was the happiest I'd ever been with my new job and boyfriend. I've been on and off meds because sometimes they don't help. I love my boyfriend, friends and family so much and I can't imagine my life without them. But in the past 4 months has been the hardest of my life and I don't know how to cope anymore. Something horrible happened and it was all my fault. I hate myself and I want to self harm but can't hide it anymore and continue to do it. I can't tell anyone this because I don't want to hurt them. I have been so depressed and draining to everyone around me and although I am trying my hardest to not bring anyone down I keep doing so.

But I could never hurt everyone around me by attempting suicide, so I feel stuck here, I'm only here for my loved ones. If I could kill myself without hurting anyone I would. I just don't want to get to the point where I actually do attempt suicide and hurt everyone around me. I feel so guilty all of the time and I don't know if I'll ever feel truly happy again.

About 10 years ago I started taking them 4wding to places like the Cape, Kimberley, Simpson Desert and practically all over Australia and in fact they met the current group of friends as a result of our travels to the Vic High Country. Last year I took them on the Canning Stock Route and felt that they were doing nothing to help, I put on the coffee in the morning, cooked breakfast, packed my swag and loaded mine and their swags on top of the 4wd, drove for anywhere up to 8 hours, unpacked, set up my swag and then cooked dinners for them. The only thing my brother in law did was to wash the dishes, when we broke down, twice, they stood there not offering to help and left me to do everything. When we got back work took a serious turn for the worse as the Federal Government changed the way they did procurements cutting me off at the legs basically, couple this with what happened has sent me into a deep spiral and have to fight back tears often in order to hide my pain from my wife & kids. I have been polite but not overly outgoing to either of them since we came back but have learn't that I have been effectively outcast from the group of friends with my Sister in Law and Brother in Law conspiring to turn these ""friends"" against me leaving me to dwell on what happened and wondering why and how I could be so blind not to see them taking advantage of me - they have done this before with other friends. She is quite manipulative and deceiving and I think has them fooled. My friend approached me the other day and came around for a chat to see what was going on as I wasn't at several functions (I wasn't invited) and so I told him how I felt, what I held back was what my Sister in Law had been saying about his wife which was absolutely disgusting, she told my youngest daughter and have heard it now from a couple of different sources.

Suic-1313,13 Reasons Why,"I'm not sure if anyone has seen the Netflix series 13 reasons why. A young girl stating through tapes 13 reasons that lead to her killing herself, the people involved then reading the tapes. I just finished watching the series and it really hit hard to home for me, being able to relate to a lot that she went through and feeling like life just doesnt get better. I've had anxiety my whole life and depression severely in the past 6 months due to a nasty breakup with an emotionally abusive narcissist that still feels the need to belittle me and our relationship. I often take to heart what others say about me and care deeply of their opinions of me. Before watching this show, i actually wrote several letters to people who have impacted my life both positively and negatively. I wrote one to my ex that was straight to the point of how he treated me and spoke to me hurt and how much words hurt. He left and broke up with me during a bad time for me when he was the only one i trusted enough to share my darkest thoughts. The letter pointed out all his lies and stories he made up about me, his fears and insecurities that led him to run away. I do blame him for the way i am now, for the emotional and mental abuse. Previously i've pointed out to him what is in the letter and how i have been feeling. It destroyed me even more how he reacted to it. Telling me that all i do is play victim, ive ruined his life, i wouldn't take no as answer, every nasty name you could call someone, liar, cheat, dramatic, over sensitive. He claims he hasn't done anything to me at all, he simply just woke up and didnt want me anymore (lie) Telling me that ive caused my depression, he has nothing to do with me. He said me telling him my dark suicidal thoughts has pushed him over the edge and he doesnt want to deal with me because he cant see why and that im being stupid. That he wouldn't feel guilty cause I am just pretending to be upset to make him feel guilty and sad. My point is that during the series i watched the individuals felt a great deal of guilty for what they had done to her. Why does my ex not see what his done? Why cant he accept his wrongs now rather than when its too late? What goes through a narcissist persons mind to not feel empathy or be mature enough to admit when messing up? I was baffled and heart broken to pour my heart out and get that response. The series really touched my heart and this was playing on my mind.",lizzie50,Community Member,09-04-2017,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,17,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/13-reasons-why/td-p/329417
Suic-1314,Feeling really down and struggling,"Hi guys, I am new to Beyond Blue and to completely honest it has taken me a long time to build up the courage to reach out for advice and help. I am feeling very down and have been having suicidal thoughts over the last month. To give a bit of a background, I am a 28 year old male, I was diagnosed with depression as a teenager and spent a few years on anti-depressants which helped me out a lot. As I got older I got quite a bit better but that has all changed recently. I have found that as a male it is really hard to tell people how I am feeling. I feel very alone, and do not entirely trust my friends or the people around me. I feel like they are laughing at me or talking about me behind my back. I know this sounds a bit pathetic but it is how I am feeling and I really needed to get it off my chest. It is really hurting me feeling this way and every single day I start feeling even more down and worthless. i really dont know where to go or who to turn to for help. As I am writing this I am nearly in tears. If anyone on here has ideas about how I can overcome these feelings I would really appreciate any advice.

Suic-1315,PLEASE READ THIS FIRST: posting in this section,"Life gets pretty hard sometimes and many people in this online community have had times where they have thought about hurting themselves or ending their life. This can be a stressful and at times overwhelming experience, and this section is here to help members who have had these experiences. This is a place to share where you are at, seek ideas for help and know that you are not alone. We are here to create a safe environment for everyone. Please do not provide any details about any plans/ideas that you may have had to hurt yourself, and importantly, help us to understand if you are safe by letting us know in the post. Making comments that let us know that you are having thoughts, but are safe, helps us to know that your conversation can continue without interruption, and that we do not need to put any further follow up for you in place. This section will not be for everyone.It shows posts from people who are distressed, offers public replies to these posts, and encourages people to come back and share how they got past that difficult point in time - what worked, what didn’t and how they now approach these difficult thoughts. It is important to think about what you want from the forums, what information you need and what threads will be helpful to your situation, rather than reading everything that is posted.

Suic-1316,I just want to curl into a ball and die,"(I have posted a few times) My life is a constant roller coaster of up's and down's. Some days you wouldn't be able to wipe the smile off my face and others you wouldn't even be able to get a smile up there. I have never been pretty or skinny. I have never had boys falling for me left right and centre and I have never been ""ok"" with how I look. I am suicidal and I self harm. I just want attention right? No in fact attention is the last thing I seek from the people around me. No one knows how I really feel and I don't plan on telling them any time soon. I guess I'm on here because it's so much easier to talk to a stranger over the internet. There is two boys in my life right now and both I have fallen for. The first one is really attractive and most of the time he is nice to me but sometimes he can be a real d**k to me. He is a very horny guy but I just brush that off as a teenage thing. The second one has been my best friend for 2 years and he's a cool guy, we went out for 3 months then broke up when I started pushing him away because of an eating disorder. I still like him very much and he likes me but the problem is he is leaving to live in Brisbane soon and I don't know if I can do a long distance relationship. I am so lost and I have no idea what to do anymore and it feels like my head is spinning with all these thoughts and voices that make me want to scream. or curl up in a ball and die.",shay2,Community Member,19-06-2013,Suicidal thoughts and self-harm,6,/t5/suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm/i-just-want-to-curl-into-a-ball-and-die/td-p/60373
