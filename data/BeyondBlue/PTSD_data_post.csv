PTSD-1,cPTSD and anxiety,"Hi,I'm struggling with cPTSD and am having panic attacks, low mood and anxiety. My partner was an alcoholic for over 10 years and apart from being a nightmare to live with, was verbally abusive to me and my daughter. After I walked out, they gave up. I have moved back home, but things aren't good. They are like a new person and have really sorted their life out, but I am suffering from small panic attacks in the night and sometimes during the day. We don't share a room yet. Sometimes I am fine when they are around me, but other times I am not. Is this going to stay with me forever or does it improve? I'm really trying to make it work.",Chriss,Community Member,08-07-2025,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/cptsd-and-anxiety/td-p/612042
PTSD-2,Birthday card from abusive family,"Hi everyone! So yesterday I turned 34. Pretty exciting another year wider. Anyway.. so i had a great day. But... I got a card from my abusive famiky. And it brought up a million emotions. I cried. I felt angry. Everything. Grief all over again. I wanted to ask what do you think the reason was sending the card? I don't understand honestly. Plus its a huge invasion of privacy and I never actually asked for a card or disclosed my address to them. They have been stalking me for years online and found out somehow. So yeah. Look what are your thoughts guys!? Cause I don't know what to think. Its a strange card with ""love bombing"" language. I just cant even understand it. After all the abuse they caused - why act innocent.",Rach28,Community Member,08-07-2025,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/birthday-card-from-abusive-family/td-p/612035
PTSD-3,Overcoming Panic Disorder.,"Been suffering with Panic attacks recently. Have suffered with them since I was a teenager. I have chosen to keep off the ale and certainly any drugs - why I thought they would help with my paranoia is beyond me. Anyway I spoke to my psychologist and he reminded me that healing from trauma is not a destination it is a lifelong process. You exercise your brain as you would your body in a gym. I know there are quite a number of people on here continuing to suffer, so as an almost 60 year old here is my advice to those like me who feel trapped in mental pain. 1. Dont bottle it up inside - speak to someone about how you feel without guilt or embarrassment. 2. Take advantage of the multitude of resources out there on the internet. Loads of podcasts, websites and audiobooks that will help you develop strategies to overcome your demons. 3. KEEP OFF the ale or any drug that provides only short term relief. Self medicating will only worsen your situation. 4. Get to your doctor sharpish and tell him how you feel. Anti-depressants plus a referral to a psych might be what you need. 5. Try and maintain a healthy lifestyle - exercise and diet are crucial. Meditation is also a great tool to help combat depression and anxiety. 6. You are not alone. There are millions suffering from mental health problems and the number grows each year. Do not be fearful of any stigma attached to mental health.",punk rock warlord,Community Member,04-07-2025,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/overcoming-panic-disorder/td-p/611892
PTSD-4,Struggling to move on,"(Safe: in my room listening to music) How do you even move on from all the things people have told you as a child? Growing up, my parents weren’t involved in my life. They used to criticise me, say that I’m a bad person, and tell me that I have to do certain things to make them happy. They didn’t care to understand or show any empathy whenever I did something wrong. Even something as small as not finishing my dinner or breaking a glass would incite a lot of criticism. They’d ask me things like ‘why are you always like this?’ and ‘why can’t you be more careful?’ They’d make me feel like a bad person and that I could never change. They’d also make me feel like I was responsible for making them happy - like I had to do something in order to please them. If I didn’t do something, like get good grades in class, they’d withhold any form of affection and ask why I didn’t do any better. And then they tried justifying their abuse, saying that I should be grateful that they at least give me the basic necessities, like food and clothing. They said I shouldn’t feel upset because I could have had it worse, which made me doubt my emotions and feel like they weren’t valid. It’s not fair my parents broke my self-esteem. They made me believe I deserved to suffer, like I had to keep hurting myself because I didn’t deserve anything good. I’m angry that they made me feel I could never achieve anything no matter how hard I try. I’m sad that I struggle to even move on in life, while everyone else is in uni and getting jobs. I’m sad that I’m stuck cleaning up the mess they made.Because of them, I never got to have a proper youth. I never got the chance to explore new things or find new people. I kept to myself and pushed people away because I felt no one would ever listen or be there for me. I felt embarrassed for having any emotions, like it was somehow not right to cry whenever my parents abused me. I thought that I was a burden to everyone and that the whole world would be better off without me. It’s hard to move on from these feelings, let alone talk about them. You keep wanting to talk about these things and ask for help, but then some voice tells you ‘you can’t do it’ and ‘no one would understand.’ And so you give up.",ScooterCat,Community Member,03-06-2025,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-to-move-on/td-p/610949
PTSD-5,I don't know what's wrong with me,I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like I'm always on an emotional roller coaster. I'm new here. I feel like I've reached out to help from GP before and because I have a child that has high level autism I'm just dismissed with not much mental help I feel like I'm so alone qu I'm sick to trigger I have angry outburst.

PTSD-6,When you can’t avoid your triggers,I know that in 24 hours I will have to be at the scene that triggered a trauma response. I’m anticipating that I will be triggered again and that it will add to the current trauma response I am experiencing.

PTSD-8,Too much trauma in 2013-2025,"Hi, I’ve been through a lot and I’ve a lot of my unwelcome family members tell me that I have no right to feel empowered. Well I’ve blocked and crossed them off. As I don’t need that. I’ve always had a fairly solitary adulthood. I had isolation from 16-26 but from 12 dealing with childhood and my parents divorcing. I met men and was clinging due to lack of affection and love from my family. The relationships ended usually after a year in disaster. I met men on dating sites. Back then flip phones had limited access to Dating Apps. I always went on chat. I felt I could connect on line. I would still go out. At 18-20 and meet guys in night clubs. But I would always want to talk online. I had a lasting relationship at 17-19 which ladted 2 years. I was kicked out by my parent so I had no choice but to move in with him. When we broke up I stopped seeing my friends. And I took the break up pretty hard. I was really isolated and became even worse so I was manipulated my my older sister to go live at home with my Mum. My mum is Evil. Witch. She feeds off my me falling in life. Not doing well. So she use to call the police on me and kick me out for doing the house work wrong. I was eventually kicked out and I had no choice but to go into a ShareHouse - At 22 - where I met a man who physically assaulted because he made fun of me for my life style. This went on where the Police were called at different properties for 3 Years. Up until 2012. I then went and searched back on line for another comforter and I met a 29 Year old called Joel. Where he assaulted me. And gave me Phycological breathing problems which affected my anxiety. He invited me back to his house. A 30 minute drive. Where he would call the Cops to kick me out, again. He insisted that I keep him as a boyfriend whilst I was trying to get away from him. He abused me through Emails, verbally and then applied to have an intervention order put on me because he abused me. I tried to keep away from him but he kept sending me emails knowing I’d check them, saying things like - I know where’s you live. I told my dad. And the police. My dad I was so estranged and distant from. But the authorities just told me to work on my own Self. I’ve copped it and gone through trauma. Plus been in hospitals and been mistreated for 10 years. I live at the beach. And I Want another reality. I Think. I’m 37.",Halecia,Community Member,12-05-2025,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/too-much-trauma-in-2013-2025/td-p/610362
PTSD-9,My dad has cancer and wants another baby,"I've never done anything like this before. I think I just need to talk because so much of this just gets ignored at home.My dad was just diagnosed with stage 4 cancer the other day. He's been given at max 5 years to live. A random bump on his neck and BAMN... No more dad soon. I got told I wasn't allowed to be sad or cry. All he wants is for everyone to be happy and pretend everything is normal. It's not normal. My step mother refuses to admit it's there. Says I'm trying to cause problems by talking about it. Mind you it's been 3 days since the diagnosis. I'm the eldest of 5 kids (on my dad's side), being 20 years older than my youngest sibling. And the minute he told me all I can think about is how my little sister is going to grow up without a dad. Him and my step mother had been trying for another baby for a year before they had her. As much as I disagreed with my 55 year old father having a newborn it wasn't my say. But now it seems even more selfish. They want to try for another baby before he goes. And I just can't take it. They keep pretending like everything is fine. That they just want to experience life and have a big family. I'm 21 and have to cope with the fact I won't have a father anymore. How can they expect my 10 ye old and younger siblings to understand? He already wasn't going to see my sister graduate high school. Now he won't even get to see her go. They already didn't have the father I had growing up due to his age, and now they will have none. Anytime I try to acknowledge or talk about this they shut me down hard. Tell me I just need to ""think positively"". About all the good times we will have until then. But all I can think about is after. A life where I don't have my dad anymore. A life where my siblings will see a photo of him and have no idea that's their dad. I don't think I can smile and pretend everything is ok. Not when I'm the one driving him to surgeries and radiation. Not when my little siblings ask if dads ok. Not when all they want to talk about is trying to have another baby. I know they might just need more time to process what's happening, but I'm just so scared. And being quiet and smiling isn't helping.",Guest_50069561,Community Member,09-06-2025,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-dad-has-cancer-and-wants-another-baby/td-p/611119
PTSD-10,sexual assault and relationships,"When i was 15 i was sexually assaulted by my boyfriend at the time on several occasions. I never pressed any charges against him because i was really young and scared of what would happen. Since then I've been drugged and taken advantage of by a number of guys since which has really destroyed my self worth and confidence. As a result of this I've developed generalised anxiety disorder which has further impacted my everyday life. I now go to uni and don't speak to anyone, stay in my room the majority of the time and it's been 4 years since it first happened. I've tried to get into relationships since but it feels like my brain always tries to pick apart every guy and find a reason not to trust them so I haven't been in one since because i usually end it before i can get hurt. I just want to be able to live a normal life again but reaching out and talking to actual people about this is way too hard for me to do still. I want to get better, but taking those steps feels impossible for me still. I just feel like I'm forever trapped in a loop of not being able to trust anyone, and picking apart good people for the smallest of reasons. Right now I'm talking to someone again who I really care about and I feel it happening again but I really don't want to ruin this again. I want to be able to trust this person but I'm terrified of enduring that abuse again. I just want to move on with my life but I don't know how to since I've never talked in depth about what i went through with anyone.",anonymous73737,Community Member,09-06-2025,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sexual-assault-and-relationships/td-p/611088

I have recently found out where his wife moved to and feel like I need to take this opportunity to contact her before she also passes.

PTSD-12,40 male with Childhood trauma PTSD,"Good evening everyone. Don’t know if I’m having a mid life crisis or that “thing” hidden in the closet is starting to creep out. im a 40s yr old male with steady job, lovely family with kids. My wife is brilliant with nurturing kids and looking after me. I am a very lucky man. couldn’t ask for a better life. However, my only darkest secret is that I’ve be exposed to sexual abuse as a child by family members and mentally physically abused by my step siblings. Been hopping to guardians one after the other due to parents not being committed. Not pointing any fingers but the shamefulness is real. On the surface level, I’m a well spoken, family oriented, fatherly figure man but on the inside, lack of self esteem, disengage and shameful I’m always trying to be positive in front of everyone and to my family. I do not want my children to experience what I have endured as a child. i’’m addicted to porn (daily basis) and tends to avoid my wife because i feel disgusted by myself. No one knows about my abuse history and addiction. i don’t have anyone to talk to and don’t have the courage to seek specialist. I’m currently applying ‘self diagnoses” by studying psychology related courses. I guess this is a head space for me to vent and a place to grasp for some air. Sorry to keep rambling but I’ve already feeling much better. please join in for discussion. Positivity shines and I believe we are powerfully to overcome our shadowed past.

PTSD-13,Physical Intimidation and Breaking Household Possessions: Struggling to recognise violence?,"It's been a while since my last forum post about in the depression section but I can't seem to avoid drama in my life. I'm beginning to think it's a 'me' problem. I'm supposed to be cramming for my assignment but this topic weighs heavily on my mind. I have a sibling called S. I got into an argument over unintentionally provoking their dog in order to stop my dog from being chased and attacked. I know that S's dog is overly reactive to loud noises but adrenaline fully kicked in when I saw it mouth my dog on the neck and yelled because my dog has been attacked UNPROVOKED multiple times by this dog. Anyways, S yelled over me for shouting at the dog when I was trying to explain, then proceeded to walk towards me in an aggressive manner and shout pretty much in my face. I honestly thought that I would gonna get hit. After that I talked it out with S and apologised for my outburst; honestly told them what I thought about their dog not being muzzled trained even at home, being over-stimulated around guests and having a history of attacking my own dog and family members and they were calm at that point. Anyways, doesn't sound too violent right now so I'll mention what scares me. S has gotten mad in arguments before, to the point of breaking things. Things that don't belong to them. In fact, even my bedroom door is screwed - I'll leave that up to imagination. So, when S walked towards me, I honestly thought I was next to break. I know that I messed up massively with their dog, but at what point is walking up to someone to shout crossing the line when I can hear them perfectly from across the room? That being said, I am extremely tempted to call the police the next time they react like this over anything, even stress. I understand being crazy angry but I struggle to understand making someone feel unsafe even if they're reacting inappropriately towards your dog. Anyways, I know I'm a bum, but I feel like an unsafe bum? P.S. They also said that I was not acting my age after they slammed a chair down (the same type they broke previously) and walked into what I think is my personal space in retrospect . That seemed pretty hypocritical...unless I'm a real bumbum. Also I don't really think of them as a sibling after they called me retarded (I draw the line at that point) so I think there is some internal conflict about whether I care about getting authorities involved. Thanks for your time and please enlighten me with wisdom so I can act my age.

PTSD-14,Abuse.,"So, when I was 4 I was put into a foster home. And I was abused awfully every day until I was almost 15. I spent almost 11 years in that House, this year I turn 18 and I’m not exactly sure how to cope with the sudden change in my environment. I feel like my trauma has made me more jumpy and less trusting. I have a new family now including an adorable younger brother and an amazing mother and father. but recently this abuse has come back to haunt me in ways I could never have imagined I’ve started acting out even to my parents and brother and I’m scared that I’m gonna do something to hurt them. I just wanna be a good daughter and sister but I feel like my trauma is corrupting me and making me a bad person. everyone I talk to about this doesn’t seem to understand that I do genuinely fear becoming like my abusers.

PTSD-15,"Sexual assault, following & intimidation","This is a long story but I’ll try sum it up.So basically 2 of my friends were dating and they broke up because the guy (Baxter) sexually assaulted my friend (Rosa) - it was a very heavy topic and I was on the phone to Baxter and went off at him because of doing such a terrible thing to my friend, and I didn’t release but he had people in his car listening in to everything I was saying. I then rang my friend Rosa back and told her I was going to go for a walk just to clear my head but stay on the phone to her in case anything bad happened as Baxter knew where I lived. I was scared but thought he most likely won’t come up here. I kept saying to Rosa on the phone “I feel like something bad is going to happen because he knows where I live, so I’m going to call my ex boyfriend (Jayden)” I then hung up and called Jayden and just said “hey can you meet me in the bottom of your street as Rosa and Baxter broke up and I feel something bad is going to happen but I’ll explain everything to you when we get there “ I hung up and called Rosa back, and by then I had noticed a red car following me around , it pulled up beside me and the back window rolled down and it was Baxter. I said “how did you know where I was as I don’t have my location on for anyone” and he just said oh don’t worry love we’re just going for a drive. Next minute him and two other boys jump out of the car and start circling in on me and backing me into a bush - they started throwing around all of these threats, luckily Jayden had showed up when he did because I don’t know what would’ve happened if he didn’t Is just it’s been so hard to navigate my feelings since it happened. Like it was really traumatic. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat and I can’t feel safe in my own house anymore because im scared their just going to show up at any point And I guess factoring my experience with men and abuse and sexual assault it just made it a lot worse",Corinaf,Community Member,24-04-2025,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sexual-assault-following-amp-intimidation/td-p/609774

Context: I suffer PTSD and have suffered multiple terrible trauma experiences. I just feel so broken. I dont know what to do. I have no life direction and all my triggers are on high alert. I also struggle with anxiety/ depression which has become more severe recently due to triggers that are related to my trauma. I just feel like anytime I try to do something and put all my effort in, im always disappointed. I always end up getting rejected, hurt, or getting my hand burnt (hypothetically not literally). I just feel like nothing good is going to happen in my life. I just feel like I am a broken human being. I feel like no employer will take me on if I want to apply for a job - im so messed up mental health wise plus I dont like being around people. I get triggered SO easily I cant control it. I guess I am writing this post because I feel so alone right now in all of this. i dont know what decisions to make because right now avoidance is the best option for me. If I avoid making any life decision I'm not going to spiral more out of control. And right now my mental health is very delicate. Plus I recently had a fight with a friend and I'm not talking to him. He's been a huge support system for me and I feel he doesnt understand my mental state right now given the stress of timing of the year also regarding traumatic events. I just feel so alone and I want to never have to work again. I want to just be left in peace and deal with my broken version of myself after being sexually assaulted, abused by my ex and abused my family. I just dont know what to do. Does anyone else understand what I am saying. I just would love to know that I'm not the only person struggling with PTSD, trauma and mental health. I just want to curl in a ball and hide away from the world, in hopes that everyone will just leave me alone and allow me peace and quiet to figure out what the hell I am going to do with my life. I'm scared of living after all the awful life events I've faced and survived. I'm scared of trying again. Does anyone else relate?

PTSD-25,My child was abused,"I’m just not sure how to go forward.i found out my son was sexually assaulted by a teen neighbour when he was in lower primary school. I didn’t find this out until he was a teenager himself and we had long moved away. I myself was molested as a child and it was always some I thought I could protect my own kids from. But I have failed. I had a small baby at the time I found out and he is now 8 years old and he struggles. I know it’s because of me being so depressed after what I found out. Everything has suffered. I have been estranged from all my family since my kids born because I asked them for support and was never believed. I am also estranged from everyone in my life because I just hate myself so much. I can’t even hold a normal conversation anymore. Nobody at work likes me, my own partner hates me. My kids hate me. My in laws have also been no support and just call me a bitch. Now my partner wants me to leave. I understand and don’t blame him. I just have nowhere to go and nobody to talk to.

PTSD-26,Feeling like things will never get better,"Growing up, I was made to feel unwanted. My teachers would constantly shout and criticise me whenever I made a mistake. My peers would exclude me and put me down. My parents would tell me I would never be good enough and that I deserved to suffer. Because of these things, I felt like I didn’t matter. I pushed people away and isolated myself because I didn’t think anyone would like me. I sabotaged my future and my chances of graduating because I didn’t believe I deserved success. I felt like people didn’t want me around and that the world would be better off if I was gone. Because of the things people have said about me, I’ve missed opportunities. I never got to have friends. I never got to feel wanted. I never got to feel like I deserved anything and I never go to feel like my life mattered. And now that all these things are gone, I can never go back and experience them. Those times are gone and I can never change what happened. Even if I work through my trauma now and undo all the things people have taught me, it will never change anything. It will never alleviate the pain. All that pain is going to stay with me in one form or another, and I will always be in a state of suffering. There is no hope. There is no future. The pain from what I have lost will always be a part of me. All that is left for me is a life full of eternal suffering.",ScooterCat,Community Member,31-03-2025,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/feeling-like-things-will-never-get-better/td-p/608870

PTSD-28,I feel destroyed.,"Hello everyone, i'm gonna start off strong for this one. I’m still really hurt over a falling out I had with people I thought were my close friends. It started because of a disagreement and some uncomfortable situations involving another friend, but instead of working through it, they ended up twisting things and turning on me. I showed them the truth, but they ignored it. I was slowly pushed out of the group, isolated during one of the lowest points of my life, and made to feel like everything was my fault. My bestfriend even used personal things I had shared in confidence, getting her boyfriend to attack me with it, including my mental health, identity, body and life struggles. After everything I had been through, it was like i was hit by a truck. It still hurts me because I don’t fully understand how it got so bad or why I was treated that way. I feel like I lost people who meant the world to me, and it left a hole I haven’t been able to fill.Around the same time, I was also dealing with a toxic relationship. Someone I dated repeatedly ignored my boundaries and made sexual comments even when I wasn’t in a state to consent or push back. I had shared my past trauma with them, and they used that vulnerability to their advantage. Even though I know deep down I was manipulated and taken advantage of, I still blame myself sometimes. I feel confused, guilty, and honestly a little broken.I’ve been trying to move on, but it’s like I carry this invisible weight every day. I struggle to trust anyone anymore.. friends, partners, even myself. I second guess everything I say and do, like I’m always walking on eggshells, waiting for people to leave or hurt me.

PTSD-32,"Feeling shattered my husband's porn, alcohol and prostitute addiction.","I have been married for 24 years, and my husband's addiction to porn, alcohol and recently discovered his addiction to prostitutes. I have had a sexless marriage for 12 years, and my husband has been unemployed for the past 5 years. My husband has numerous DUIs and is on the interlock program and returned from Rehabilitation last year, which was court-ordered. I have spent most of my savings hiring lawyers for his DUI convictions to avoid incarceration. I recently discovered my husband has been seeing prostitutes whilst I was visiting my sick mother. A substantial amount of money disappeared from my bank account. I contacted the bank and found out my husband accessed the account. Upon investigating, I discovered my husband has been to the local Brothel. I am broken-hearted, all these years my husband's excuses for not having sex were poor erection problems, not formally diagnosed. I discovered 12 years ago his porn addiction and last year my husband subconsciously was caught in our CCTV footage mastubating at our front porch. I asked my husband if I could check his timeline for Google Maps, then realised he had been to other brothels. I have been faithful to my husband all these years, I feel betrayed. I confronted my husband initially denied, and he later confessed to adultery. My husband confessed this was his initial visit to the Brothel, and he was not aware he spent 6.5 hours with the Escort. He assured me he did not have intercourse as the prostitute was trying to help with the erection, and they talked for long periods. He then claimed the condom came off, and he failed to recall the events as he was intoxicated. Yet my husband could scan his card and access his PIN every hour, despite being intoxicated!. I requested my husband to be screened for STIs.I am traumatised, depressed, suffering from insomnia, low self-esteem, and poor appetite. I have taken time off from work to recuperate. I am exhausted.Over the years, my husband has broken my heart through neglect, yet I loved him with every broken piece. I cannot share the room with my husband anymore, My husband has requested not to take any drastic measures and to concentrate on my self-healing.

PTSD-34,Feeling Lost,"I (23F) was in a relationship with someone I really loved (24M) until recently that lasted about 3 years where we lived together… I had been in past relationships before this one that had been quite bad in terms of emotional and physical abuse, so I didn’t think that there was any issue with this one and I really thought I was going to marry him and have kids with him, so I feel utterly disillusioned. he had been very open with me about his previous relationships, and had detailed to me about six months or longer into the relationship that one of his previous partners had enjoyed watching porn with him and using adult toys to please himself, and that he liked that, and wanted to do it with me. I did not want to do this, but became quickly aware of the fact that this disappointed him, and he was upset with me and said I made him feel ashamed of himself… It was at this time that he also disclosed to me and showed me his extensive collection of porn DVDs, magazines, flashlights modelled off of porn actresses, and scrapbooks he made of porn actresses that resembled people he knew and were our friends. He had told me a lot of this had been because his ex-girlfriend had encouraged this. over time and after having struggles with him misplacing funds, lying about money, excessive gambling, and both of us having to skip meals, his porn collection grew and to an extent that I would estimate at about 500-600 porn DVDs. He had been open about wanting to please himself, and at the time I felt that this was only fair since I didn’t want him to feel stifled by me, and I felt that any feelings I had that were bad about it, were selfish and insecure, and any time I brought it up it made him very defensive and upset. this dynamic culminated in him sitting in the lounge room with a case of beer, a 2L tub of lube, and at least four fleshlights (that were correlated to the women he would watch) watching porn for days, at least twice a week, for about two years. This prevented me from having people over, opening the curtains, participating in any household task, or leaving my bedroom, and over time, made me feel like I had no control or choice. It became so much so, that I had multiple bad depressive episodes, all of which I felt ashamed about, and he called me ‘unattractive’ or ‘crazy’ for having, and would use this as an excuse to watch more and more porn. Since breaking up with him and losing my housing in the process, I feel so so lost.",Sunny_days,Community Member,17-03-2025,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/feeling-lost/td-p/608312

PTSD-36,Broken and Lonely,"I’ve lived through multiple traumatic events since childhood, which have deeply shaped the way I see and interact with the world. Growing up with an emotionally absent mother, I learned to distrust authority figures, and that distrust has persisted into adulthood. Though I’ve been sober for seven years, certain situations still trigger emotional reactions, and I often find myself dissociating when faced with stress. At 48, I live with the lingering effects of those experiences. I tend to isolate myself, especially in social situations, and fear still has a strong hold over me. I’ve tried to break out of this cycle, but it’s difficult. I’ve had EMDR and various treatments along the way, but there are still some challenges—like the difficulty of being in a room with a therapist, which often triggers old wounds. Despite all of this, I’ve made progress. I’m in a better place now than I used to be, and I’m learning to navigate the complexities of my emotions. But there are days when it feels like a struggle, and I know that the way I’m living isn’t sustainable. I want more out of life, more connection, and more peace. It’s a journey, but I’m still moving forward, even if it’s not always easy. Single and living with chronic distrust, anxiety and people pleasing behaviours, lost my identity in the process.

PTSD-37,Workplace injury horrible rehab Comcare invalidity - can anyone help please?,"I have a psychological claim with Comcare that has been going on for years. I want to get away from them and out of the system, but they (and my awful employer) keep hounding me and sending me for multiple psychiatric exams and IMEs. They will not find me a job, will not give me a redundancy and will not put me forward for medical invalidity. I am just kept in constant limbo. The rehab consultants ignore all the medical advice and have not been able to find me a job. I have found the rehabilitation consultants to be the most useless nastiest pieces of work. They act like policemen telling me everyday to call up friends and beg for a job. They told me to do charity begging work even though I have poor social skills and anxiety. I am unable to approach people and beg for money. After 10 years of this ongoing crap, I am very unwell and don't know what to do anymore. Comcare said if I try to challenge anything or don't do what they say, they can go back and raise a debt against me for 10 years of payments (hundreds of thousands of dollars) so I am in a nightmare with no way out. Has anyone been through this? Can anyone offer advice or assistance as I need help.

PTSD-40,M abused by brother,"I am not sure what to say, I need help, I am a 45 YO male and I have been verbally abused by my brother for 13 years now. I am at the end of my rope, and thinking of just ending it, but my sister is willing to let me stay with her, about an hour from where I am, I just need to figure out how to get there. The short version is I have never worked in my life, I have irritable bowl syndrome, it means I spend a lot of time in the toilet ( in my case cant stop), and it has made living any sort of normal life impossible, and as such I have had to live with my mum and dad (well mum since dad died in 2012), and so does my brother, although he has run a business but it is pretty much dead now. I guess I just don't know what to do beyond just fleeing and giving up on most of my stuff. What do I do when I get to my sisters place, its just 1bedroom unit but she wants to move. I am hoping a friend my help me escape, but what if he gets abusive, and I call the cops, would they even bother being male on male/brothers and not actually physical abuse. How do I go about getting help for all of this, especially the shame being a male, and the guilt, sadly my mum has been in hospital for almost 4 months, and will be bed ridden for the rest of her life, which is likely only months, and fleeing means it would be almost impossible to see her. How do I get help, he has been abusive not just to me, but also my sister, a friend who has his girlfriend but now just lives with us for his work, and she is almost 72, and uses our mums money for gambling.I know its dumb, but I really don't want to call the cops, I think that would make him worse.",BigAlan79,Community Member,28-02-2025,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/m-abused-by-brother/td-p/607542

PTSD-43,Sexual Assault -  Not sure what to do,"Hello Everyone, I have recently come to the knowledge and understanding that I was sexually assaulted a few years ago. I was at a work party and I had been drinking. At the end of the night, one of my work colleagues dropped me off at home and walked inside with me where we had sex. We were both over the age of legal consent. I just assumed that because we had both been drinking alcohol, it was not considered to be assault. In the last few days I have realised this is not the case. This person had been interested in me for a while at work and I had made it CRYSTAL clear that the feelings were NOT reciprocated and nothing was going to happen between us. I knew he was married which automatically made him off limits but also, I was just not interested. We lost touch for a couple of years but recently got in contact again. Since that night he has continued to make it very obvious that he is STILL interested, and I have continued to tell him that I am not. A friend pointed out to me a few days ago that he sexually assaulted me. They are 100% right. If I was sober, it NEVER would've happened. I barely remember a thing about that night and I hadn't had more than 3 drinks, which leads me to believe my drink was spiked, although I don't think it was by him. I chatted to him on messenger yesterday and asked him about the night it happened. He said he has a pretty clear memory of it all and what happened back at my house. It's clear in his mind that he thinks I wanted it, but also that he is very much aware that it wouldn't have if I was sober and that it will never happen again. The fact that he was able to describe my body in detail, what we did in my bedroom and remembers what I was wearing, shows me that he was far less under the influence than I was. I am NOT okay with this. I don't know what to do with it all now.

PTSD-48,"Bad dreams, ptsd, abusive relationship.","Hi everyone. Last year I finally got out of an abusive relationship that went on for over 3 years. he was my first ever partner. he was mentally and physically abusive. since then i've had trouble with sleeping and my dreams. In day time I am fine, but when I go to sleep I either have dreams about my ex attacking me or running after me, or threatening to kill me like he would in real life. or I dream of blackness and I start hyperventilating and sonetimes I silently scream to the point where it hurts and my body aches when I wake up. I sometimes cry a lot in my sleep and wake up in a sweat. is this ptsd? i'm on anti depressants but I still have these dreams. it's really starting to affect me.

PTSD-49,Abused,"Hello All I'm 35 now and I keep having flashbacks from being sexually abused by a lifeguard when I was early teens. He was in his 20s. He literally groomed me over a summer hoilday and gave me lollies, food and let me and my siblings work in the canteen. I found out a couple of years ago it happened to my twin sister too. She never told me. I recently was on Facebook and his face came up on a page he was working for, it made me sick. I went to go to the police last year, it took a long time and then they said I would have to go to trial and relay everything so I freaked out.

PTSD-51,Narcissistic Mum,"I have recently turned 50 and have been a carer for my narcissistic mum. She uses all the usual tricks, gaslighting, verbal abuse, isolating me, sabotaging etc.My mental health has spiralled and after being a carer for 10 years, I feel depressed, anxious and suicidal. I suffer from childhood PTSD with physical and emotional abuse. We were also often starved as children and were never provided a stable loving or nurturing environment.She is now 82, has two brain tumours and has fallen and hit her head twice. But after being repeatedly verbally abused in front of doctors and nurses, I broke down. I can't continue and often feel like the only way to be free is to take my life.I am on a carer's payment so I take the abuse because I am scared of being homeless. I have no husband and was unable to have children. I have had a case manager assigned to me as I spiral further into my depression and suicidal ideation.I have told her I can no longer be her carer, she is trying to guilt me. I have no self esteem and feel guilty for leaving my mum in the hospital. I have no support network, no friends, no income and feel so isolated and desolate. My life has passed and I my body goes in to panic mode as I am continually traumatised by her abuse. I feel so much shame and lost in life. I have no idea what to do, I will soon be homeless and I will be unable to make car repayments. I'm a scared little child at 50 years old and I long to close my eyes and never wake up.

PTSD-52,Narcissistic husband,"Hi, almost 3 years ago I discovered that my husband of 28 years had cheated on me what I thought was on 3 occasions. I discovered he had been to prostitutes. He blamed me because we had not had a great sex life for years. When I confronted him he denied it until I asked for his phone and showed him the messages. He then told me it was all my fault. He wanted to go to marriage counselling but would not book it. I ended up booking it. The counselling did nothing. He swore to me and the councillor it had only been 3 times. Fast forward a couple of years of hell and he finally admitted to this going on for 26 years. I did what he wanted, gave him sex regularly. It was hard as I felt so broken and he didn’t care for my needs. Then late last year he told me, after I probed, that he had continued to see prostitutes as it didn’t feel consentual. This was after telling me he hadn’t. Continued blame on me and no understanding of what I was going through. I also discovered he had downloaded dating apps going back 8 years. He lied to me from the beginning of our relationship telling me he hadn’t travelled extensively before we met. He also told the same story to our kids for years - so lied to them about his travels. That hurts the worst. When I called him out on it he just dismissed it. I feel trapped as I can’t afford to buy him out of our house or to sell and buy a place. The housing market here has made my hands tied. I would have left him years ago if I knew of his behaviour. I have to bide my time as my son is still in school and I know he will become very very nasty when I tell him it’s over. I feel scared and trapped. The hardest part is that he blames everything on me.",Mstuck,Community Member,27-01-2025,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/narcissistic-husband/td-p/606121
PTSD-53,Lost - Abusive marriage. Finding myself,"Hi,After 19 years in a toxic marriage I am finally almost divorced, after being constantly told there was something wrong with me, reminded of how useless I was, reminded of my dysfunctional childhood , having the finances controlled and told I needed help I went to see a counsellor who told me that it wasn’t me who needed help and showed me what I was experiencing, it was like a light switch and I grew more confident and assertive. I had a support network of friends who were like family. I was then offered a job to move to another state and he felt it was a good idea too. Fast forward to 2018, I suffered an injury which meant I had to take time of work, the mental abuse was suttle at first however it started to get worse and worse to the point I was threatened and told to leave, when he knew I had no where to go, he would tell my children how useless I was, I returned to work as fast as I could and he would take almost all my pay, it seemed to get worse as he knew I no longer had a support network - eventually I became so worn down, depressed and felt so trapped, I started just shutting down and taking the abuse. my credit rating was finally fixed and I used the opportunity to store money away, he once again threatened a divorce or separation and I stood firm and accepted it, only for him to a month later say he was forgiving me for whatever I had done - I didn’t accept it and said I want to leave - he threatened I wouldn’t have my children however istood firm. I had to find a rental in th area close to school which was very expensive. I thought it might change but since living seperately he’s still a bully and I feel I’ve finally hit a wall - he’s not given me a cent and I’m scared to take further, he’s extremely cruel and I’ve tried so hard to co parent but anytime I try to stand up for myself he will place horrible demands or restrictions. I feel so stupid because I’ve started to submit and I’ve lost myself somewhere, I’m overwhelmed and I’ve started isolating from the world hiding away. I don’t have family or friends and wouldn’t want to add my life story or negativity onto new friendships. I’m sorry for the Debbie downer post. I’ve never been in a place where I’m ready to give up and everything feels so overwhelming I become exhausted- I have zero will left",Esther89,Community Member,24-01-2025,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/lost-abusive-marriage-finding-myself/td-p/605985

I will do what ever I can to make sure others are first - offer the last choc even I I really want it. Give up something nice I have because they like it too.

PTSD-57,Seeking support groups in Melbourne south east,"Hi all.

I found myself fully functional at a in charge level of one of Australias largest companies to coming home and being a mouse of a man .

PTSD-58,Is this sexual assault or regret,"Before I continue with the incident I’d like to note that I have a partner. I’ve also been raped manny years ago and still struggle with that trauma I have a friend who has a partner who for 6 months have been trying to engage in a threesome with me, I have repeatedly mentioned how uncomfortable this makes me and sometimes I’ve had to leave their house because of how pushy they become. It’d had been awhile since they had brought it up so I thought the fantasy was over. Well recently I was drinking at their house and they offered me some type of drug I’d never had, my friend kept getting me to sit on her bed and her and her boyfriend would get closer and closer eventually they started to take my clothes off and dressed me up in some outfit, I was so anxious and my friend just kept saying how happy this made her how long she’d been waiting for this and I just stayed quite, I didn’t move for the longest time I just let them do whatever they wanted, it went on for hours I at one point even made it seem like I was enjoying it, her and her boyfriend seemed to be enjoying it so much. I just didn’t say anything, I didn’t say no. infact at one point I just said to my friend you can do whatever with me I don’t care my friend finally said that she was done with me and I was so relived I got up got dressed and cried as I left. I tried to talk to my friend afterwords saying how uncomfortable I was and how I want to tell my partner. She’s now threatening that if I tell him that everyone will know that I’m a whore and everyone will know about what happened. But I don’t care what happens I feel so disgusting and I want to tell my partner. My question is, am I just regretting what had happened because I understand the pain it would cause my partner when I tell him or are these feelings of disgust and betrayal because of how my friend took advantage of me. I just need honest answers, I plan to talk to my partner regardless of my what my friend says, I try and pride myself on being a good honest person and I’ve never cheated or thought of cheating ever so my partner deserves to know",Abby2,Community Member,16-01-2025,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/is-this-sexual-assault-or-regret/td-p/605639
PTSD-59,"My story, wanting to understand.","Hello Beyond Blue,I hope we are all going great for new year. Im wanting to share my story, I'm trying to get the free councilling sessions from Victims services, but in the mean time I just want to be heard, I'm a 25 yr old male if that helps. Trigger warning: This involves DV and emotional/psychological abuse as a child. I'll try keep this short From as early as I can literally remember, my parents had a very rough relationship. I can't count how many times I watched my father beat the absolute fuck out of mum. We lived in a rural area with my grandparents in the nearest house across the paddock. From about 3, when the fighting started, I'd run over to their house screaming for them to help, and they'd go try break it up. My grandparents were my anchor at that time. Often I would cry to stay there because I was scared of the house. Id have this same nightmare over and over, and I'd dissociate heavily when my brain tried to ponder on my fears. So there was the DV, but another thing among others that fucked me up (this may make your stomach churn a little), when I was maybe 3-4, my father would sit me up on his PC, and show me extremely violent pictures and videos on an old website that any 90s/00s folks might remember. This pains me, as I feel my father stripped me of any innocence I had. I get teary thinking about it, what kind of grown man shows a child whos favourite passtime is Sesame Street and the Wiggles, pictures of people committing suicide and people being executed? The DV went on until I was about 5, my mother had more then enough, my baby brother was not long born. She feared one of them were going to end up killing each other, and I don't doubt her validity. After I was taken away by DOCs, for the remainder of my childhood I had to visit my father every fortnight. Nearly everytime I visited him, there was always something stuck up his arse. If it wasn't him driving my emotions into the ground, it was death threats on my mother, he'd tell me he'd kill her and any man she got with, any baby they would have together. The shit he would say and emotionally do to me is a plethora of absolute pathetic insecure dribble. I swear sometimes my father wanted me to fail, either that or he is a complete moron that thought he was trying to toughen me up, which just did the opposite. It went on up until I was maybe 13 when I started giving shit back to him, once I got older he calmed down a lot, he realised he couldn't control me anymore so he just gave up. Our relationship has been pretty good over the years, but a number of times we got into punch ups and arguments when we were drinking. I guess that was just me finally releasing all of my pain for him to see. But, some people you just can't change, he even laughed at me one time while I balled my eyes out screaming at him. But besides all that, most of my childhood was good, you always have to remember the bright side. I had pretty bad anxiety throughout highschool, I found socialising extremely difficult. But I'm not bothered about it because I know most people don't go through what some do, so I take it with stride. A lot of things resurfaces when my mothers partner, who was a paramedic, spiralled into a state of Fentanyl addiction and PTSD. It started back up when he locked himself in the bathroom one day and tried to kill himself by OD. I went into adrenaline mode and started CPR, I watched the life just drain out of his body, it was complete insanity. After that, a lot of memories and feelings from my childhood resurfaced, I started having the same nightmare I had as a kid again. Months after just before I was to finish yr 12, my girlfriend at the time who was my rock, broke up with me, and that really fucked me up even further. I quit school and wallowd in depression, but not long after, my ex step dad accidentally set the house on fire an we lost everything. Honestly, when it was happening I just dissociated again, the loss didn't really hit me as hard as my mother. I've tried to keep everything short, theres a lot more I could talk about, but thats the bulk of it. Just wanting somebody to read my story, and maybe help me out a little. At the moment I'm struck with Anxiety and Agoraphobia, dunno if I suffer anything else but I for sure am pretty emotionally dysregulated. Thank you a lot of you read this for me, you don't have to reply but I'm cool with any input anyone has.",Cacciatore77,Community Member,10-01-2025,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-story-wanting-to-understand/td-p/605335
PTSD-60,I have so many regrets,"I’ll get straight to the point. My father was a very unintentionally charming man and everyone who’d been in his company found him funny and charismatic. What they didn’t know was he had a temper and aggressive streak. Both my mum and I had been the targets of his fists. My poor mum also had to suffer the wrath of her father. I still to this day (in my mind), see my father physically assaulting my mum. I have red marks and bruises all over me going to school. Back in those times, nobody looked at these issues. Mum used to blame me for being beaten up by my father. I left and ran far far away being independent for my whole life. Until I met my partner. I foolishly thought I’d met someone who genuinely loved me and wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. Then the nightmare from my childhood returns in the form of my partner. He was lovely and sweet before the kids came along. Then like a switch, he became this person who is not like the one I was with before kids. He became more aggressive and critical. He doesn’t like being asked questions (questions=attack on him). We used to mark appointments on calendars so we wouldn’t double book. He stopped, citing it was none of my business, or he told me weeks ago so why couldn’t I remember. I didn’t want to have a child until I get a new job and settled in. But he told me time is of the essence and we needed to try soon. I asked, what if I couldn’t get a job after having kids? He told me not to worry as he would take care of all of us. Then it started. Like a switch. I had a horrible birth experience and needed a lot of support. He told me women have babies all the time and I should just move on. I said I couldn’t go through it again for a second child. He laughed of course we were having a second child! Yes I agree with you if you’re reading this. I am stupid. I trusted him and loved him. So I gave him a second child. When second child was 4 months old, he assaulted me and tried to call the police to falsely report I endangered my children. Why did he hit me? I told him we shouldn’t let our 3.5 year old climb all over tables disturbing patrons at the restaurant and not to let him run across the carpark. He told me his parents tried to control what he did and that now I was doing the same to our kids (3.5y and 4mths). I was shocked. He wanted to sell up everything so he could go hide away and we had to fend for ourselves. He rushed back during lunch next day and gave me a hug (I think it was more to check I hadn’t taken the kids away). So that has given him the license to do it again. My childhood nightmare continues. Why am I so stupid? Why didn’t I run away? Why did I have the babies. Now I’m scared, trapped and hopeless. He made a false report on me that I attacked me when the marks were from me defending myself. The police gave him a lot of assistance as to what to do with me. Now, if he doesn’t like something I say or when I disagree with him, he said he would call the police to tell them he doesn’t feel safe because I’m crazy. I feel utterly hopeless and worthless that I’d gotten myself in such a situation.",miniforever,Community Member,06-01-2025,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-have-so-many-regrets/td-p/605136

I tried to defer him away because I was so uncomfortable but he kept going. I opened up to my friends but since we are all in the same social circle, the mutual friend has claimed he thought it was consensual. My friends have cut me off because of it. It makes me feel like I didn’t do enough to stop it. I don’t know exactly what he has said to them, but it makes me question if my story is even true. I second guess what happened and struggle to stay true to my story because I’m convinced I didn’t do enough to stop it and it was my fault. I don’t have any support friends anymore. All my friends have cut me off. My parents don’t know because I don’t want to stress them out. I am scared of reporting this to the police because it might cause more of a drift between me and my friends. I am also scared it’s going to get turned back on me again like it was my fault.

PTSD-62,Police Issues,"I, and I can only guess, too many others, have been denied a voice. I am disturbed by the way police issues are handled in Queensland. I always heard about bad police but have only recently come to see just how bad an officer of the 'law' can be. I do not believe that one's mental health should completely deter them from speaking out. That those of us with Complex PTSD are treated as though we're the classical movie version of insane, is derogatory and offensive to say the least. It is discrimination. I have not given up on being heard. And I condone anyone else, who is safe to do so, to speak up. The problem is the misuse of one's appointed office. Those who are corrupt wield their power over the general public IS NOT acceptable from those who work in the public sectors. These people create and enable criminals. And they ARE criminals too. The majority of us who resign to bad behaviour, are ourselves the victims of injustice. And sadly, we defeated victims have given up on certain morals and principals. We have given up on the idea of a better world and instead, let go and accept our predicament. It's the whole, monster begets monster thing. If we can't defeat our monsters, we lean towards becoming just like them. Though I've noticed some of us tend to do this either, in complete denial or completely unaware of one's self. If we can't be heard in court. If the law fails you as it has me. Find a way to speak. Forums, the correct government departments, make an anonymous complaint to the police headquarters of your state, share a brief letter about your opinion in the Letter to the Editor section of newspapers. If you are sure you are wronged and are sincere, there are those who will take notice. We may not see the chain reaction that comes from one person caring, but it just might be that, that one person will become part of a larger change. BUT remember, there are certain rules to addressing certain people or departments. You may not see any results for you, that's true. It is about many voices growing together as one. The more who speak, the louder we get. The louder we get, the harder we are to deny. SPREAD AWARENESS. Certain mental health issues should NEVER be an excuse for injustice to be committed against us to have our voices made unheard. It's time ALL public employees were made to undergo mental health checks regularly, from psyches, outside of their own department. People are people, regardless of who or what. Fallible. Flawed. Bias. Common.",MimzeeMc,Community Member,07-05-2019,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/police-issues/td-p/455642

I am a middle aged female who is not good at talking about me or my feelings but I am suffering, my marriage is suffering. Growing up watching my father abuse my mother was very distressing. Us kids weren't on the receiving end but it still impacted greatly. I was not close to my dad I had a lot of fear, hate and anger towards him. I learned from a young age to appease people, not express my anger and to defuse situations not escalate them. We were a very close family with no other family in Oz. My mother was my world as were my sisters and brother, we did everything together and my husband and I were always there if needed, especially for my youngest sister who became judgemental, opinionated of me and my family as she grew. My older sister in her late 20's was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, she turned on me, hating me and tried to hurt me physically. We couldn't trust her around me at all. Basically I lost my eldest sister as our relationship and she was never the same and I blame the illness not her.In 2004 I suffered an injury unable to use my predominant arm with multiple operations to try and fix I was diagnosed suffering chronic pain disorder, anxiety, panic attacks, major depressive disorder and loss of memory & time. I shut my emotions down to cope with the pain and got by as I had 2 children try to look after-lasted 13 yrs. I couldn't seem to unlock my emotions after. My father died 2014 my mum didn't cope (depression?) helped her through it all as much as we could while my sister and family were causing trouble for mine. Mum and I had an argument over them as the judgements, accusations wouldn't stop and I just couldn't keep taking it and that day changed everything. Mum turned on me/us and said told horrible, nasty malicious lies to family and they were happy to believe it. Who would have thought the very people I was closest to and trusted most in this world 'my family-my best friends' would be the ones to hurt me, my husband & kids so badly. They threw me/us away. I use to 'feel' so much love, laughter and happiness. That trauma too is locked inside. After 8 yrs I reached out as I couldn't live with myself if anything happened to them, nothing has been spoken about what happened but it is not the same. I don't belong.

I'm not even friends with the person she sent the screen shot of, that person had simply followed me. I was so angry. I pulled up, called her and basically ended our marriage. I was so hurt and angry at her for even thinking I could ever do such a thing. If I was that kind of person, I would have cheated with her when we reconnected but it just isnt me. Anyway, we are trying to sort our shit out BUT, I just cannot seem to get passed the hurt and anger. I feel like she doesnt trust me. Without trust there is nothing. Not in my eyes anyway.

PTSD-66,Too much - I can’t handle anymore,"Hi Ten years ago (seems like a long time) I made a stupid decision to go online and try to date. I was 26 I had a 3 Bedroom house all to my self. I was Working. It was 6 houses from the beach. This guy, I met on oasis (dating App) ruined my mind set and affected and Ruined My LIFE. I say this because he controlled me todo anything. It was an online dating app. This got really Toxic and became bad really fast. I made the mistake of allowing him to pick me up and take me back to his place in his car. As soon as I was there, he’d (with his Mum) kick me out. I faught back and was manipulated even more. The police got involved. He said he used me for financial gain ideas. And that he needed help. I was so pissed off, but I didn’t want todo anything as you could imagine that would result in criminal activity. So I let revenge manifest over the years. He would Email me at Late wrong times. Like I.e 2:00 in the morning. And torment me by talking about himself and how he thought my sisters were a catch. I’ve gone through depression My whole life. And whilst I was drinking, and from a divorced Family I was coping and managing. He managed to isolate me from my family. Then he applied for an intervention order ON ME. Couldn’t fkn believe IT. Because we kept fighting in Emails and Phone Conversations. I’ve managed to move myself over 69 Times whilst dealing with people (share house tenants, and families) shit. As I approached mental Health.., (they wernt aware what I was going through). So they miss diagnosed me and detained me every time I went to an Emergency department for Help because I was homeless. I havnt had kids or met a person through ANY OF This. My mothers lack of support just means I want her further away from me. I’ve gained so much weight from stress eating, and I was over weight before. I developed an abscess skin infection (which I’ve endured for 9 Years) and ive had multiple insicion and drainage operations. Anyway I’m highly (At_My_Wits_end) suicidal and all the advice I got from sister (3 of them) in Canada.

PTSD-68,Today is not a good day,"So much has happened in my life, since childhood. My father was very strict, my mum had mental health issues since childhood. We were sent to my Nan's when mum was not good and we were often by my dad that we would be sent to an orphanage. Whenever they had an argument I was told it was my fault, I believed that because mum got pregnant with me, they had to get married. I was often left out, whilst my sister was loved by everyone, I have always loved her, she is my rock. When I was 17/18 I got my first job, where I was groomed and sexually assaulted by my boss. At the same time, my parents separated and my mum took my two sisters to live in another town, then a couple of weeks later, my dad moved out and I was left alone. I often wondered why I was left behind, that I was so unloved. I have no happy memories of my childhood, I remember hugging my dad once and he told me to get away and pushed me away. I never hugged him again. Throughout my life I thought I had friends but I've found that most of them talk to me only because of my husband. I worked hard and had a good reputation and then I started working where I work now. I didn't notice at first how toxic the environment was until I found out my boss was telling everyone how useless I was at my job. Apparently my boss told other staff what a terrible person I was, how I couldn't do my job and told stories about me. I couldn't figure out why colleagues stopped talking to me. I decided to resign and another manager stopped me, a few weeks later, my boss was investigated and had her contract terminated. I have spent the last couple of years trying to unravel the lies spread but it has been hard. In the meantime, I have had breast cancer and a heart attack and I am not the person I used to be. Now my marriage is in name only, and my husband who says he loves but he no longer shows affection or sleeps withe me.

PTSD-69,Narcissistic abuse recovery,"Hello Everyone, I just wanted to say hello to everyone in this group who may be struggling at this time to be able to talk to someone and get the support of resources that they may need at this time.I am presently trying to focus on recovery after being in two NPD relationships back to back.I learned a lot but it was also extremely traumatic and I have so much too unpack. ONE of the biggest things is how to have healthy relationships, set boundries and gain my own self worth and just plain saying no and putting myself first.Some of the things a NPD doesnt want you to do is be empowered so its unlearning all of that so your not absolutely miserable. Its amazing that we give so much away in the name of love only to have someone completely abuse it. I am the only one who can say no and no again and I want to exercise that right. Anyone who loves and supports you will work with your needs and not need to take so much.You may not be in this place and time in your own recovery as everyones story is different but I do hope that you have some support or are on your way to being able to reach out for it.

PTSD-70,"Coercion, Abuse, and Feeling Alone in My Struggle","I’ve been coerced into sex by someone who I thought was a mentor and a leader in human rights.I respected and admired him lots.He’s a researcher, a women’s rights defender, and runs a civil service organization. He approached me romantically and coerced me into sex, making me feel trapped and confused. We were in a relationship, but the whole time, I felt pressured and controlled. The event happened before I came to Australia. I was staying in Thailand at the time because of the conflicts in my home country. There were some times I was sick, intoxicated, or under his influence, and he used that to manipulate me. I initially resisted even his kiss,but it felt impossible to escape later days because of his repeated attempts and influences. Looking back, I now realize that what he did was wrong, but at the time, I didn’t understand it fully. What hurts the most is the disbelief and blame I’m facing from others, especially on social media. People don’t understand coercive control and rape, and it feels like no one believes me. He kept reaching out to me online, using me as a sex object, and I’m devastated by how he used me for his own purposes. I feel worthless, like I’ve lost my dignity and self-worth. The trauma, nightmares, and pain are overwhelming. I’m seeing a therapist almost every day to try to make sense of it, but it’s hard to cope when society and the connections he has make me feel so alone.

PTSD-72,Time to boundary up with toxic family,"I took my kids to my home country for a visit earlier this year. I have been low contact with my father for around a year. It started out when I couldn't handle his lack of effort anymore. I would often send him pictures of my kids (school, outings etc) and tell him stuff. His response was mostly a thumbs up or at best - a ""how nice"" comment. My low contact began as a test: if I stop writing will he notice and reach out. Will he miss me? Well that was a big fat no to that last question. I've heard nothing and his effort in communicating with me is pure business ""I've put money over for the kids birthdays"" (IF he remembers that is.)Our visit home was the same lack of effort. We lived at my mums place while back visiting and she was pressuring me to go spend a week at dads house. I told her that made me feel very uncomfortable - I don't want to stay in a place that puts my entire body in alarm. And being around my dad does just that.I told him I'd be happy to meet up somewhere (picnic, forest trip) but that I didn't not want to sleep at his house. I have a child who is neurospicey and forming a base somewhere is important for his well-being. I have come to realise my communication with him is purely from a place of being an obedient daughter who is always ""nice"" and let people walk all over her. And my mum expects the same of me. Kindness, self-sacrificing and ignore your gut-feeling.I was never expected to move away. I was never to have dreams of my own. I was meant to stay in my home town, obey and serve my family. In stead I moved to another country and is now realising that if I hadn't I would've been miserable forever. And I can see now, that my dads behaviour...my own two brothers behaviours and my mums also, when I speak up and ask ""why can't we communicate more often? Why can you be so generous with your time when we visit home but cut me off when I go back to Aus?"" ...is all about punishment. I moved away where they wanted me to be bound to them forever, in servitude. Because I am told I should just move back home if I want to talk more often. Where realistically they could press a button and instantly send me a message IF they wanted to.

PTSD-73,***Trigger Warning*** Sibling sexual abuse,"Hi there, I won't be able to write everything down so I'll try and get to the point of everything that has happened to me in the last 9 months. For ref I'm a 31 yr old mother of 3 young children and a wife. I've never struggled with mental health in my life up until now I'm having a complete mental breakdown and am just now seeking help so I can find myself again. I was sexually assaulted by my brother in march. I still can't wrap my head around it and I should've got help then. I hid it from my husband and family for about 4 months before I broke down and told my husband. It is so far from anything anyone ever expected. I don't really know what I'm trying to get out of writing this on here. Sorry to change direction but it will tie in at the end... I have a very toxic, emotionally abusive and narcissistic mother. She is a horrible human who I've called out many many times for her words and actions. I have cut her off many times throughout my life and she has always squeezed back in only to hurt me again. However she is now no longer in my life as of about 2 months ago and I will not allow her back again. But the thing is I told my mum this had happened to me about 6 months ago and she unloaded on me and told me he had also been doing it to our mum for about 4 years (I'm his biological sister and mum is his both our biological mum) it's so screwed up. I also found out my dad knew (mum and dad have been divorced 10 years) and he invalidated her and failed to get my brother help. I no longer talk to my brother obviously and had to grieve our sibling relationship whilst also dealing with what he'd done to me and our mum. I also have another brother I don't talk to as he has bipolar and depression and fails to seek help and he tried to bash me so I have an AVO on him. I have a sister as well who also has children and we were incredibly close, but in spetember she abused me verbally and harassed me because I had made the choice to cut off my mum. She never understood or listened to me when I would tell her what our mum had done to me and how toxic she was. So I've recently had to lose my sister too, and my children their cousins... There's just so much to unpack and so much I need to talk about, I'm getting a mental health plan on Monday from my gp and getting as much help in the meantime as I can. I've been using alcohol and drugs to escape. But I had a massive break down two weeks ago and since have completely stopped drugs all together and won't use them again. However alcohol is still a problem and I'm trying to get help for that too. This year I also got married, had major surgery, sold our house and our business. I think I was just trying to hold it all in and hold myself together for too long and now I'm broken. I don't even know myself anymore.

PTSD-75,The day I lost my soul,"6 years ago today an event occurred that changed my life forever. I went to work, and 18hours later when I finally walked out of that place I was never the same again. Looking about at the person I was before it, and who I am today....I can only describe it as losing my soul, the guy I used to be ceased to exist. I've lost so much, my home, my life, my drive and any sense of happiness or enjoyment in the short journey of life. I'm resigned to the fact that I'm never coming back, no treatment, medication or self will can ever remove this pain I live with daily. Everyone I know tells me that they believe in me, they believe I'm still inside and they believe that I can overcome this. But they're wrong, the person I used to be could of overcome those things, im not that person anymore. No one seems to understand, it's like my mind and soul left my body that day...but my body kept living. There's no better life in the future, just more days of pain and suffering. I didn't ask for this to happen to me, im not a religious person but I find myself asking god did I do something in another life to deserve this punishment. For someone whose job was to lock evil up to protect the innocent, I am now a prisoner inside my own mind. Yet, there is no key for this door and no one can hear me screaming to be let out.

To bully them and shame them for every little thing they do? In school, I was teased, excluded and put down by many of my peers. Not many people wanted to be my friend, nor did they want to be my partner when it came to group work. In recess, people would always put me last in their games and make fun of me. The teachers would also shame me if I couldn’t do my work or if I did something wrong in the yard. Not once did they offer any compassion; they rubbed it all in my face and made me feel like I was a bad person. They yelled at me and they didn’t care whether they shamed me in front of other students or not. The home environment was no different. It was just as tormenting at school, except it felt more painful. When the people who were supposed to be your biggest allies hurt you, you suddenly realise that there’s no one in the world you can ever trust. As an adult now, I see people who have friends and others who care about them while I wallow away at my feelings and struggle to move on in life. Why couldn’t I have had the same?

PTSD-79,Friend is still friends with the person who sexually assaulted me.,"Hey there, this is my first time here and first time posting. Last year I was sexually assaulted by a ""friend"" after I came out as trans to them. I don't particularly want to go into that, but the thing that is really plaguing me is that my friends chose to believe the assaulter rather than me. It took me a bit to get the guts to tell my friends, and its clear that during that time the assaulter ""prepared"" or something. After the whole ordeal, I was quickly abandoned by most of my friends and I now have one friend left. He's been my friend for over a decade. However, he's clearly part of that groups mentality. Just a couple of examples: I told him of what happened, and then only a week later he invited the assaulter to our discord server so we could play together again. I decided to leave the server because I didn't want to be around him, and my friend responded with annoyance and mentioned how ""inconvenient"" it is for him to have deal with me leaving the server. On top of that, he constantly talks about the assaulter and all the fun they've been having together with the group. All things that I use to be able to be a part of, but now don't want to because of obvious reasons. It's very clear that he wants me to ""Get over it"" and just make up with the assaulter or something. It only really hit me today how messed up this is.

PTSD-84,Dealing with racist views,"*Trigger warning - potentially very distressing* A couple of weeks ago I saw someone in town I knew. We were having a conversation when she began to express some generalised statements about a particular group of people. It progressively got worse into more blatant racism. I expressed that what she was saying was upsetting me. It then just got worse in terms of what she was saying and I found myself suddenly saying, ""I can't continue this conversation, I'm sorry"", and I just automatically left. The reason it was triggering for me is because a really gentle soul from my childhood was murdered with the perpetrators even admitting they did it on the basis of race. It was this same group of people the above mentioned person in town was referring to. I am being particularly vague so as to protect the identities of people affected. So all these sudden trauma emotions came up for me around this issue and that's why something in me just took over and I said I couldn't continue the conversation and left as a form of self-protection. The person I walked away from knows people in my unit complex and she has turned two of the residents against me. I am now dealing with daily comments that I hear clearly from the courtyard such as ""F#%k her"" and similar in reference to me. Today I wrote a one page letter to explain to the person I walked away from why her comments were so distressing for me, including explaining about the murder, and put it in her letterbox. I am hoping she may be more understanding as a result but not necessarily confident that will happen. I now feel persecuted in my small town because I took a stance against racist speech. I feel like I need to leave and I just don't fit here. I love the surrounding landscape and feel connected to that, but I feel I am out of place in this conservative town and unless the people currently hostile to me can come to understand my point of view and past experiences, I feel I am going to be in an awful situation daily from now on. Has anyone else ever dealt with anything like this? I actually feel unsafe and I already struggle with a whole lot of complex trauma issues around safety. I did talk to my psychologist today which was helpful. I am working on just standing tall and being straight forward and doing my best not to be intimidated. But I do feel very unwelcome here now. My closest friend in these units is my elderly neighbour who is now in hospital and so I'm concerned about her too.

PTSD-85,Is this normal?,"So as I’ve gotten older I’ve had these moments where memories from my child have popped into my head, driving or laying in bed at night or mid way through watching a movie, and they are of some traumatic moments from my childhood. Often it starts with things I remember but then moves into part of the memory I haven’t previously remembered. It isn’t always the whole thing either, it’s like there’s holes or parts missing but I know it belongs to part of that memory and I know there’s gaps in it. An example is tonight I remembered my suicide attempt while in high school, I haven’t thought about this in years or any part of it and then all of a sudden I remember putting on my school uniform on Monday morning as if nothing happened on Friday night and I didn’t spend all weekend in hospital. But then I don’t remember what came after that other then I remember one psychologist appointment 2 weeks after the attempt and then blank again. I then just sit there and question how I could have forgotten that? It was obviously such an awful time but it’s like it was wiped and then just popped back up tonight. I guess my question is, is this normal?

PTSD-88,My struggle with PTSD,"Hi Beyond Blue community, I would like to share my story and battle with PTSD. I was a victim of domestic violence from my father, who suffered from bipolar disorder. After my mother and I escaped his abuse, I became her carer at the age of 13 as she battled a rare disease (AVM). This involved many traumatic events, including risky facial surgery, the smell of rotting flesh, bleeding from her mouth, and regular calls to triple zero. This horrible disease caused severe facial disfigurement as parts of her face had to be removed to eliminate the illness.Fast-forward to the present, my mother and I have been targeted by neighbours in a smear and hate campaign aimed at forcing us to move. We have been threatened, our property damaged, and harassed daily. I’ve had to take out personal safety orders and call the police almost every day. Sometimes, I’m too afraid to leave my mother alone at home while I’m at work. Unfortunately, this has been triggering my PTSD from the abuse I experienced in my childhood. It has affected my social interactions with work colleagues and others. I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts and the overwhelming feeling of being stuck, as though nothing is improving.My goal is to escape this nightmare and start fresh, to prioritise my self-care and provide my mum with a safe environment where we can live in peace and rebuild our lives. I've had regular counselling and tried medication but until I escape this toxic neighbourhood I will never be free of this.",B97,Community Member,19-11-2024,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-struggle-with-ptsd/td-p/603427

PTSD-91,Lived experience:How to feel enjoyable in activities again?,"Dear all, I don’t feel anything is enjoyable anymore. For example,if I play a game on the computer and then I am feeling, say uncomfortable,sad or anxious. The next time I see the game or try to play it, the same feelings I had at that time are attached to that particular activity. And I avoid it, to avoid feeling that same way again. All of the things I do are to distract myself from what I am feeling or trying not to think of ect. Does anyone have learned experience of how to make activities not like this or enjoyable again? I have avoided so many things because of these attached feelings. And I need to live my daily life again.

PTSD-92,Why do we need to label it?,"I experienced abuse as a kid over many years and never spoke about it until I was in my 30's. Living most of my life without labels, it makes me cringe now when I hear people use the reference victim survivor. For me, it is unhelpful. How I feel can change from day to day. Sometimes I feel like a victim and other days I feel like a survivor but I find it more helpful to say that I experienced what I did. For me, it leaves room for me to grow, evolve and try and live my life the best I can. If I am told I'm a victim or survivor of something then that label sticks. And sure, we may well be a victim or a survivor of our past but I feel that it is so much harder to find ways to look towards a fresh chapter of life when we aren't given the chance to take our experiences with us, no matter how hurific the pain and how traumatic the experience, without the chance to choose for ourselves how we want to be seen. I don't hear of others feeling this way, and perhaps that's because the use of these labels in the media are so widely used and accepted, but I wondered what others who are being labelled feel about this?",Catie 08,Community Member,07-11-2024,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/why-do-we-need-to-label-it/td-p/602896

PTSD-96,How can I properly help my friend navigate their current situation with DID?,"My long-distance best friend (known since high school) has been having a horrible time recently with lots of different situations merging and It seems to have become too much to deal with. I was only informed about his dissociative identity disorder earlier this year, and this has never happened before, or at least not to such an extent that I've noticed it/interacted with an alter (? I’m not actually sure if it's an alter this time around or a result of stress-induced amnesia as I don't want to pry). His condition has been somewhat inactive in terms of switching because if he had experienced switches before, it was not for long periods of time. I think it was more of an internal thing, but has suddenly become more severe. His ‘usual self’ is said to have gone dormant in a sense, due to the immense stress and lack of ability to process everything that is happening, and has been overtaken by a personality who has forgotten the details of the past year and lost passion for all his recent interests. Prior to this switch, he was EXTREMELY unstable, and I spent days trying to help him stay as calm as possible but the episodes were uncontrollable. Yesterday, there was a sudden change. He was being really incoherent and then asked who I was to him. He says he remembers me, but our other friends are blurry, he only recalls facts and not his feelings for them. He’s asking me all these questions about what happened in the lead-up so he can relay them to a psychologist he’s seeing next week. He's not cold towards me by any means, but there is a veil between us even though we're talking to each other easily. He's very analytical, trying to think through the things that occurred etc and taking notes. I’m just not sure if I'm approaching it correctly. I’m currently answering his questions and showing as much support as I can while trying to wrap my head around the shock of the whole situation. He says he doesn't know if the persona I'm familiar with will ever come back. I'm just clueless and lost at the moment, because he's my best friend and it hurts to see such a dramatic shift. Truthfully, I was slightly sceptical before this but the things we are talking about now would have caused endless arguments only a couple of days ago. Whatever happened, there is a tangible divide between who I'm talking to, and the friend I knew.

PTSD-97,Things that live in my head rent free...,"In summary:A lot of bad stuff happened in my life. Bad stuff is still happening. My upbringing and my attitude has turned me into a cynical, bitter man. I hate been this way. It would be liberating if all these thoughts, these memories would just disappear. But I need to find some way to accept it and move on. To not beat myself myself up every time I'm forced to turn the other cheek, or feel like a coward for not having been more assertive in the past. I don't want to be an old man and still be seething about something that happened in school for crying out loud! If anyone could offer some advice, it would be greatly appreciated. Context:- I am a 27 year old male (in case that has any relevance)- Bullied almost every day from Kinder to Year 11. I was even belittled by some of my teachers. Dropped out of school for this reason.- Constantly ridiculed and then back-stabbed by most of my so called friends.- Spent my pre-teen years with a step-father who used to verbally abuse my mum. Almost became physical at one point.- Came out of school riddled with depression and anxiety. Was forced to take anti-depressants. Things can only improve now, right?- Nope- 2015, forced out of our old unit by a new neighbour who threatened to physically assault me, and used his sons to intimidate us in our own home. Police did nothing besides give them a talking to.- 2016-22, more neighborhood dramas transpire because Mum decided it would be a good idea to try and open up a dialogue with the next door neighbours about the noise they were making. It went about as well as I expected.- Numerous police call outs, verbal abuse, vandalism, vicious rumours and a narrowly avoided brawl later, things are marginally better now since next door finally moved out. We still get glares and remarks from a couple of those who still reside in the complex. I still have a beef with this guy who keep putting rubbish in our letter box and staring me down every time I go out to walk my dog.

It’s been a long time since I’ve written anything on here. I forgot this site existed for a long time, I forgot about my account, until just now. For a long time I thought I was fine without therapy, that I didn’t need it now. It’s clear to me now though that I need serious help. The way I treat myself sometimes is abusive. Even I know that. When I make a mistake I feel the need to punish myself and have sometimes hurt myself. I hold myself to an impossibly high standard and it’s physically and mentally killing me. I’m pushing myself so hard at work I’ve been throwing up during shifts. I’ve been neglecting my basic human needs in the pursuit of money, going all day some days without any food or water when it is easily accessible to me. Yet I still don’t eat or drink enough. Am I self sabotaging? It wouldn’t be the first time.

It is a patriarchal society where older males are in control of the group and women and children are reportedly forced into servitude to name just a few of their disgusting ideologies. Needless to say I made it clear that I was not interested in joining. The women in this cult are very young and I am old so why did they approach me? Easy, I'm an older, single, retired woman who lives alone, has mental health issues, has no support whatsoever, owns my own house and has a small amount of savings. If you join this cult your assets become their assets. I wish I could identify this cult so you could read about them on the internet. I can say that SBS ran a series on cults a few years ago and this cult was featured, except it was the US one which is where it originated from. I just need some support right now as I've never come across anything like them. The older men just seem to be playing with me like a cat with a mouse. It's their way of punishing me.

It wasn't a dating app so nothing that conspired was something I predicted nor gave a thought to. My daily life with withdrawals was like walking through hell and he gave me endless support, kindness and advice. He told me from the start he was married and his wife cheated on him. In the early stages of friendship I tried to offer advice and suggestions about counselling etc. Although I was uncomfortable he showered me with Christmas presents and then a birthday present. I told him to stop since it made me uncomfortable. Months passed and a emotional bond was formed. He has two children and would show me videos of him feeding them or keep me informed of his activities as a dad. I use to ask him if he had anyone to help him and he would say no. He slowly painted a picture of somebody solely looking after his children and separated. After awhile the compliments came forward and slowly the language became more as a partner not a friend. I slowly developed feelings for him as we ended up being quite intimate. Only to discover after asking point blank about his wife and have him talk about her like it was an often spoken of topic.

PTSD-115,"Sexual abuse, trauma and anxiet","Sorry all l did an introduction post and can not seem to be able to edit it. Small mistake in it. Was married to a woman for 20 years and then left me and started a new relationship with a new woman it was meant to have said. OG post below Hi everyone my name is Narelle and l believe l have PTSD and Trauma along with anxiety. I am a 54 yr old openly gay woman and from a very young age had encountered many episodes of sexual abuse from siblings, mothers boyfriends for years. I think a lot of my mental health stems from this due to my mother not believing me and accusing me of lying. My mother abandoned me when l was 16 and l had to learn to live life on my own. As life went on l became a mum to my beautiful daughters and went through a relationship break up where l had a breakdown and the father to my children offered to care for the kids for a few weeks to give me a break. Friends of mine overseas bought me a plane ticket and l went to see them to have a break. While l was away the father to my children along with his mother gave the kids to welfare and labelled me as an unfit mother all because l had a breakdown. One of my childhood abusers who is a sister of mine was asked by the welfare to look after the youngest, 3 years old. I did not know where my kids were and l was not allowed to see them. 10 years later l found them and they were still in the system and my partner at the time would impose ultimatums on me about me kids. I became married to this person for 20 years and started a new life with an amazing woman who was my world. The jealous ex wife took it upon themselves to interfere in my new relationship just to be spiteful because they could not accept the fact that l no longer wanted to be with them. Needless to say my new relationship is now over as the ex succeeded in destroying that with stories and lies which l have proven are incorrect. The woman who was my partner is an overthinker and struggles to see the truth and fixates only on negativity. Saddens me to know l will never be believed on anything l say despite knowing l am telling the truth to them. I get triggered by frustration and it comes from my childhood abuse experience of my mother never believing me. I feel like my ex partner has also abandoned me just like my mother did. I have no one in my life who l can bounce off and talk to. My ex partner was my rock and they made me feel safe but they are gone. The ex wife and ex partner message each other a lot about me and my ex wife’s reason is jealousy and is playing games with the ex partner but is making it out that l am the one who is doing it all when l am not.",Narelle,Community Member,24-09-2024,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sexual-abuse-trauma-and-anxiet/td-p/600265
PTSD-116,Feeling lost,"About a month ago I had to call the police in regards to my partner assaulting me (first-time drug and alcohol-fueled). The police have since pressed charges against him and they issued an AVO for my safety even after they had asked me if I wanted no contact and I specifically said I still wanted to talk to him.We didn't follow this no contact for the first 2 weeks then he got scared and finally stopped talking to me. a couple of days ago, I stupidly called him numerous times and went to his place and he called the police on me and had me charged with harassment and I now have an AVO on me. I feel stupid cos I didn't do any of the things I should have done after the initial assault to protect him as we were planning to still be together. But now I can't believe how stupid I was and the fact that he could press charges on me after I protected him I am a mess. I have no family support as I don't want to get them involved and I also have no friends where I am.

PTSD-118,Domestic violence trauma,"Hi not sure how to start this story as it's quite difficult I come from a background of F&DV and Child sexual abuse, my father used to assault my mum nearly everyday he used to physically assault me and my brother's and my dad was messed up badly on drugs, once we got older we left home my parents divorced and my brother went with mum I went my own way I had a job where I thought one of the workers there was quite good looking but apparently he had a family anyway we ended up catching up and we fell in love he was charming and bought me jewelry and flowers and treated me special, then I got pregnant to him and everything changed he threatened to physically harm me while pregnant, this should have been my first red flag, but next time I seen him and mentioned it he said sorry he was joking but I had noticed his demeanor had changed and he was happier than usual, then just before our daughter turned one he told us get ready he was going to take us out for lunch we got ready waited..3 yrs went by before he stuck his head back into our happy lived, again I let him back into our lives not knowing that he was a full blown drug addict, I had been clean since he left. he was very cruel person even to our daughter and dog, boxing Day 2009 after he had collected his drugs and introduced me to the chick he was cheating on me with he decided to badly assault me in the car. you have no idea how many times I wanted to run the car into the barrier on his side, I was looking for police on motorbikes but nothing.....

PTSD-119,Not sure how to tell my family (rape),"When I was 11, my virginity was taken by a man from rape in my home.I never told anyone in my family, and after a few months I told some friends at school and they shamed me, accusing me of making up lies and that I didn't realise what I was saying as rape is a serious accusation. I learnt to keep my mouth shut and as I grew older, I started to feel safe to share with some people that ""my virginity was taken non-conconsensually"", as this felt not as serious as using the word rape. For me, it removed the weight of the experience and this was reflected in how people responded to it. ""Oh, that sucks!"". I started self-harming when I was 13. I stopped and started over the next 2 decades and was in and out of therapy.I am now 33, in therapy with a fantastic therapist (finally), recently diagnosed with PTSD and everything is bubbling to the surface. Certain friends know, I'm claiming that I was raped and being clear about it. My partner knows but for some reason I feel that I want my family to know. It happened while they were home, only a door between me, my rapist and them. I don't know exactly why I want to tell them, maybe to explain away my mental health history? And for some other reason I feel the words get trapped in my throat just at the thought of approaching the conversation. How would I even start it? How could I explain my reasons for wanting to share? What's the point? Is it self-serving to relieve myself of the desire to tell them and burden them with the knowing? Why now? So many questions. It would be helpful to receive reflections, your own personal experience with sharing with important figures in your life, even advice.

PTSD-124,General question for anyone who has experienced Sexual assault as a child.,"Hi, I was violently sexually assaulted as a 9 yr old by 2 guys. Despite much counselling from a brilliant specialist I had (and still can't 50+ years on) never been unable to forgive my 9 yr old self for a really dumb decision which has had ongoing effects since that day. Logically I know that it wasn't my fault but it was ... I didn't ask for what happened to happen, but I did decide to go a path that I was not supposed to go unless i had friends with me. So yes, it was my fault.However my question is -- I have told only 1 un-medical person ever (the medicals in the know are either dead or my current GP -- and the un-medical person is dead now also. (Sad, but I am relieved) I have been married for 45+ years and have never told my husband anything about my experience. I think that to tell him now would actually destroy our relationship trust-wise because he would be devastated that I am too scared of his reaction to be able to be open and honest with him.So what is the point?Interested to know the thoughts of others - particularly those in the same situation.

PTSD-125,Husbands porn addiction,"Ok, so I first came here when I needed help with my husband's depression but here I am a couple of months later and I am so traumatised and messed up in the head I don't know what to do. I knew he was alcohol addicted, I knew he was depressed but I didn't know he was popping prescription medicines or that he has a porn addiction too. During the course of talking to my husband and hammering him for answers I decided I would do the one thing I never imagined doing, I snooped. What I have discovered has left me in absolute ruins. In December last year over the course of 3 days he searched for and visited 52 kinky websites and signed up on 13 Kinky Dating sites. When confronted he of course denied it but I wasn't having any of it. To cut a very long story short I have discovered he is addicted to porn and has even watched it at home right under my nose. The nature of the porn has gotten worse and while I haven't actually viewed any of it judging by what he was searching for I can only imagine. My heart is shattered, my head severely messed, I cannot eat, cannot sleep due to nightmares, I have invasive thoughts - things pop into my head at any time and I'm really struggling to deal with it all. He has accepted he has a massive problem and wants to get whatever help he can. He is genuine in this and has begged me to stay and help him. The trouble is, who is going to help me? There seems to be so much out there for his addiction but all I can find is sites telling me how I'm feeling. I already know that! I need help to accept, move on and heal. I am so lost. I don't know who I am anymore, I don't know who he is anymore, I'm broken, sad, depressed and have been having crazy irrational thoughts.

PTSD-126,Triggered by actions. Reliving Trauma.* Potential Trigger Warning *,"Hello, 4 weeks ago my beloved cat was killed by my next door neighbours dogs. They had dug under the fence and I found him dead. We followed council laws and our property was safe for him,but the dogs dug under the fence and we didn’t see it coming. For 2 yrs we have lived next to them and everything was fine. When I found him I lost it screaming hysterically. I can’t get that image out of my head. The look on his face. The fact that it was just another normal day for us like the last 3.5 yrs,and now he was dead infront of me and in my arms. I haven’t been okay since. I have spoken to mental health professionals and am being treated for a variety of things. PTSD being one of them. I keep getting triggered by my own dogs, who had nothing to do with my cats death. I understand that. My cat was raised with our dogs and they all got along like family. They loved each other. However now,when my dogs pick up their toys and shake them in play, all I can immediately think of is my cat. My mind freezes,my body feels a flush of dread,it stiffens up and pain goes through my body.My teeth clench and my neck stiffens to the point my head gets a sharp headache. I understand that my dogs are just playing with their toys. There isn’t anything violent about it, just play. But my mind still goes there. Does anyone have any advice on this?

But in that time, I (47) have grown to despise certain parts of her. It's like her medical issues and personality got all jumbled up. I hated the illness, but i didnt hate mum. For a long time everything was a crisis with mum, at least in her own mind. Over time I got burnt out. I would regularly just drive off to go for a walk to get away from her constant fears, worries, nagging. The problem is now whenever I get phone calls from her, I blow up. Today I went down the shops, a drive I find peaceful but being interrupted by her calls just made me fly into a temper tantrurm. I get that I'm her carer, support system, but sometimes I just need some space. How do I stop over reacting this way? It hurts her, it's shameful. I have a woodworking hobby as an outlet.

PTSD-133,I’m a victim of image based abuse and I feel really upset and alone.,"I’m a female in my mid 30s. I have children of my own. I was in an unhealthy relationship for many years. I had children with this person. During the relationship there were a lot of red flags that I should have payed more attention to but somehow ignored. A year or two into the relationship he had sexual intercourse with me whilst I was asleep. He didn’t physically hurt me but there definitely wasn’t consent. a year or so later I woke up to him a similar incident involving my face. Near the end of the relationship I woke up to him taking photos of me and touching me whilst I was sleeping. I was upset after each of these situations, we broke up shortly after the last one. A few years after we broke up (so fairly recently) I was looking at some digital photos he had given me and found a folder full of photos and videos he had taken of me whilst sleeping without consent. In some of them he’s touching me intimately. min some of them he’s moved my clothing to get a better “shot”. He’s also recorded us having sex without my knowledge or consent. Even though these photos were taken a few years ago and we have since broken up, I still feel really upset about it and violated. Some of these photos were taken at the beginning of the relationship and others were taken at the end of it so this has happened on a lot of occasions and has occurred over a long time. Ive searched online to see if I could connect with someone else who has been through a similar experience but can’t seem to find anyone? surely I’m not the only person this has happened to? I know that it’s illegal to take photos like this without someone’s consent but most of the info I can find focuses on the nonconsensual “sharing” of intimate images and says nothing about nonconsensual “taking of photos”. The ex and I did sometimes send consensual nudes to each other throughout the relationship but this feels completely different due to the violation of trust and privacy surrounding these photos/videos. I feel really hurt. My self esteem is affected. I feel like this has affected my self value negatively. I don’t know what to do about it from here. I don’t know if I would be taken seriously if I reported it? I’m worried that my ex would just lie and say that they were consensual if I report it?

I made the decision and it took 4 months to get him to actually leave the home. I have since been told many things he said and did that I was completely unaware of. It seems that he had a laid a very cunning long term plan which mostly centred on my trust and naivety. My whole sense of self has been rocked and my world turned upside down. I am now 52 and feel so stupid for trying so hard for so long with this person. I think a lot about laying down to sleep and not waking up and what a relief ir would be. I have 2 children who that would hurt greatly, so that is not an option. As a result of the type of person he is and the way the relationship was, I am highly anxious and fearful. There were violence and threats in the beginning of the relationship which eventually ground me down to a fawning and weak person. He has no empathy for anyone in general so he would actually laugh if he knew how bad I am feeling. I have gone completely no contact for months now, but he is now attacking me through the legal system. I suppose that I would just like any advice anyone may have.

Since the early days of my relationship with my partner, her daughter has constantly attempted to sabotage it through the following methods…creating jealousy issues when my kids use to visit us for school holidays..by trying to get them in trouble by false stories, bringing up her mum’s ex partner often to see my reaction, inviting her dad along to private gatherings that her mum and me organise to attempt to cause an issue. Now that she has 2 kids….she is attempting to create a bigger conflict between her mum and myself by constantly forcing her mum to visit her at her house where her dad lives in the granny flat. I have for years gone along to visit her with my partner even though it’s been uncomfortable to be around her ex husband who is autistic and has no concept of relationship boundaries.The ex husband constantly dredges up about my partners married life with him and relives the thing they use to do eg holidays. I have ceased going along for the weekly visits to my partners daughter’s house to maintain my calmness. I feel my ptsd is getting worst as the narcissistic daughter now demands frequent weekends away without her kids and my partner has to babysit the whole time at her house. The daughter is very aware that her mum is a pushover and that this is causing major issues in my relationship with her mom. My partner works in high stress corpoarte environment and the weekends gives us a chance to have couple time by either travelling or catching up with our friends. I am at a crossroad now and wonder if its better for my ptsd to rent my own place and end the relationship? My daughter has moved in with us for her university studies and is concerned for my mental health. She has confirmed my opinion about my partner's daughter being a narcissist person. I have tried so many times to get my partner to join me at my psychologist office to discuss the dire situation that is been caused by her daughter but she says 'theres nothing wrong and your just picking isssues'. Close friends and family have adviced me to walk away and be happy rather then be 'gas lit' and stay in a coercive situation.....any advice??????

PTSD-142,Bad experience with police/reporting rape?,"Hi, I am hoping to hear from other rape survivors in hope someone has been through what I have. When I reported my rape an officer encouraged me not to report 2 other assaults by this person because it sounded like ""risky sex"". This really hurt, because each time I was badly assaulted. I am wondering is anyone else who has reported rape in Australia has had bad experiences with police like me? I am finding it really hard to understand why not all victims are given the chance to go to court due to 'not enough evidence' as well. Of course rapists will deny it and I just cannot understand how this is all the system does before closing a case. Has anyone else struggled with not having 'enough evidence' to get a conviction and bad remarks from police officers? This has really deeply affected my trust in society. It just feels hard to understand the world when you are raised to believe these things are wrong, yet police support the rapist. Thank you for any insights. I have felt very alone in this and was wondering if there are others out there who have had similar bad experiences when reporting their rape?",TimTams,Community Member,14-04-2019,PTSD and trauma,66,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/bad-experience-with-police-reporting-rape/td-p/430091

PTSD-144,Narisstic adult daughter,"Hi I am new here. For many years I experienced abuse from.my husband then left him when my daughter was 6. She has autism and an intellectual impairment. I always ha difficulty dealing with her behaviour. We saw numerous therapists and psychologist but no one helped me with her aggressive, revengeful control behaviours. I honestly don't think they believed me. I have a teaching degree so I knew how to manage children's behaviours but I couldn't control my own child. She is now 21 and is living with a boyfriend who is now under her control. She displays narisstic traits. He has been so good to her and he is a kind soul. His family is now very worried about their son and have asked me to help. But she won't listen to anything I say to help her in any kind of way. As a result of years of abuse from my own child I also have received trauma from her. It breaks my heart that she is now hurting another gentle soul and family. Is there anything I can do to convince her to get some help?",Scampy,Community Member,15-07-2024,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/narisstic-adult-daughter/td-p/595516

Due to the housing crisis I kept a diary of the happenings until it was time I move out and then proceed to report to police.

I have reported to police 2 times now as I was told by the woman's sexual assault councillor that there is a victims assist package to get me out and safe but need a police report number. Police are not taking it seriously making excuses for his harrassesment. I feel let down by police, they are meant to protect us. Police said I'm only reporting as a retaliation because landlord has kicked me out. It's actually the landlord retaliating on me because he found out I have evidence.

PTSD-150,Struggling with guilt for being on DSP and being triggered by comments,"I have ASD, ADHD and CPTSD (from childhood) and recently got approved for the DSP. I should have been happy but my housemate made a comment under her breath and then complained about dishes. She's complained to her coworkers (I found out through someone else) saying that she thinks I'm capable of work. It sent me over the edge and I relapsed with self harm after 2 years without doing it. I struggle with feeling safe at home in general due to my upbringing and I'm at the end of my rope. I can't find any housing as I'm on Centrelink and rentals reject me as there's a big line of people waiting and workers and families are priorities and I can't afford a caravan. Been on the cat 1 housing waiting list for 2 years. Anyways I feel guilty because I can't work my regular job. Only volunteer work and my housemate and other people believe I'm capable of regular work because the volunteering I do is for emergency services, both fire and ambulance. (Fire gets quiet in winter). The thing is for some reason emergency services is the only work I've not dreaded, I love it. It's the only place that's ever made me feel like I have any value and when I'm on a job it's the only place I feel like I'm in the moment, like my heads calm for once and I can work but I still struggle with some stuff due to trauma. It's helped me with self confidence and building skills. Sometimes even when I'm neglecting everything else and unable to get out of bed it's the only thing I can bring myself to do The thing is tho I still feel guilty and like I'm nothing but a dole bludger who should be able to handle regular work. I've tried paid work again and again over the years and it's always ended up with me hospitalized or frustrated. Because of my housemates comments too I don't want to be in the house at all. I had a breakdown today at the possibility of having to move town to get housing. If I move town though I'll have to move or drop my volunteer work and my only supports are here and I might have to rehome my lizard. I don't want to rehome a pet due to my living circumstances again. It's killing me, all I've ever wanted is stability and I would love to work a regular job and be normal. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I feel like nothing I ever do is good enough and that I'm never enough. I've thought about paid work in emergency services but it would be a long time to be well enough to do it full time and even then there's the possibility I'm too mentally ill to do it full time.",Lezza,Community Member,23-06-2024,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-with-guilt-for-being-on-dsp-and-being-triggered-by/td-p/594057
PTSD-151,Feeling Stuck,"Hello, Needing more advice and hope from the wonderful people on here as I've got none and can't think of anything else to do. I'm at a point in my recovery where I feel stuck, my issue is that I dream too big and have self acceptance problems. I have CPTSD, Depression, Anxiety a chronic pain disorder and recently been diagnosed with ADHD. I feel like I have tried everything to get better and it's getting worse and I am more nihilistic, everything I try feels like a failure as I'm not ~better~. I cannot accept myself and that recovery is a journey which isn't cured therefore I cannot get confident because I must be perfect to equal greatness which stops me from trying to pursue further education or passions. It feels like a self fullfilling proficy. I can't stop dreaming big, this leads to heartache when I realise all the work it will take to get there, which is hard to believe will ever happen because it's been 15 years of healing and I'm still falling apart at work when criticised or feeling judged or triggered by a client (I work in mental health) spiralling into a tunnel of worthlessness and defeat. I want to give up DSP which I know is impossible to get for start but then if approved I'm screwed financially and have to give up up my rental and change the remaining things that spark any joy (hobbies that cost money).",Debbie Downer,Community Member,27-06-2024,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/feeling-stuck/td-p/594332

PTSD-155,Advice please... I am lost.,"Trigger warning: I was attacked by my partner unexpectedly. They have never shown signs of any aggression before this happened. We just came from a bar (my partner's drink may have been spiked). I don't know what to do next. A few months after, I went out with a friend who I trusted. I'm usually a cautious person but I trusted my friend. I only had two beers that night but that was all I remember. I know I had about a 12 hour window where I don't remember anything but I keep getting snippets and flashbacks that I somehow know are linked to that night. I get flashbacks of those incidents often. Just after the blackout, I would wake up either crying or screaming and shaking, drenched in sweat. That lasted for two months, almost every night when I was completely alone in a boarding house. I still get really nervous expressing this and I'm far more cautious of the world now. I feel like I have to be vigilant all the time and on my guard. Along with this, I moved countries for work but I was made redundant there due to mismanagement, I became homeless, experienced financial hardship (unemployed for a year), had a threat of armed robbery, had malaria, and severe food poisoning. I lost count the amount of times my life was genuinely in danger. All of this happened overseas and within 6 months. I'm now back home and feel sick to my stomach most of the time. I find it very hard to find meaning here when everything is easy, and I have people around me genuinely care for me and can provide for me, instead of being alone overseas. I don't know what to do.

PTSD-162,How Mental Health Affects Physical Health?,"The state of your mental health has a big effect on your physical health. Anxiety, stress, and sadness can all weaken the immune system, which means the body is more likely to get sick. Stress that lasts for a long time raises cortisol levels, which can cause problems like heart disease and high blood pressure. Anxiety is linked to headaches, stomach issues, and tense muscles, among other things. Depression can make you tired, make it hard to sleep, and change your eating, all of which are bad for your health and energy levels. Mental health problems can also make it hard to live a healthy life, which can lead to bad eating habits, not exercising, and abusing drugs. Also, mental illnesses like worry and sadness can make chronic illnesses worse, which makes them harder to handle.Having good mental health makes your physical health better, which helps you live a longer life and deal with illness better. Taking care of mental health is therefore very important for physical health and happiness of life as a whole.",Guest_9934,Community Member,23-05-2024,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-mental-health-affects-physical-health/td-p/592005
PTSD-163,First post,Hi I was wondering if anyone out there has experienced a damaging life change similar to mine which I can't seem to fully conquer. My parents turned to an extreme religion when I was a young teenager and uprooted me from my school and friends and basically my life. Eventually I left but it's caused an ongoing hurt that I can't escape it's affected my whole life as much as I try to forget about it and stay positive. I can't talk with other family as they just say get over it get on with it type of thing but it's a real struggle sometimes and lately I guess as I get older I think about it more. I've never had closure as my mum died and my father is a selfish nut who has never helped me and abandoned me. I don't seek sympathy I've never posted on here I have always been very independent made lots of mistakes from trying to know how to be in this world when my growing mind and love of the world was ripped away at a young age. It's difficult to explain and those who I should be able to talk to aren't interested but I wonder if there is anyone out there who can relate.

PTSD-165,"The Green Mile, ( warning content may upset people)","My PTSD life. Last night I had one of my night mares It happens every few months. There is a scenes towards the end of the movies ""the green mile"" where the prisoners go through a mock execution hours before the execution. The end of my nightmare was ME. I was allowed to say my last words, i forgive the judge, the jury, the lawyers for sending me to the execution table as you are only working on the evidence you have been given.I then died. How I got there you ask? This was the end of my nightmare in full technicolor. what started this was my mind trying to identify my sexual abuses. In the nightmare I almost identified the people but when the the imaginary face masks came up to their noses everything went blank. Then there was the one person who over 8 months abused me multiple times. In the nightmare again I almost identified the person when the imaginary mask came up to his nose. Things went blank. Between this and the green mile there was a court case I convicted of a false charge then executed. What that court case was I do not remember. All I remember what I just wrote. NOW you are wondering why I'm writing this? SUICIDE is a dirty word. No one wants to talk about SUICIDE in public.WHY? Suicide is a major societal issue AND NO ONE ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THIS. WHY? I am one of very few people who is willing to talk or write about the problems sexual assault victims face on a day to day bases.There are many that have survived their attempts yet will not talk about it or simply found a way of taking their life. I am a multiple suicide survivor SEVEN, thats correct 7 times I tried. I am a sexual abuse survivor. I am a first generation Australian, not a great thing. You can bury your head in a bucket of sand and say ""it didn't happen"" or you can face reality. It took me 40 years to face all this. It took me another 7 years to go to court and win. Its taken seven years to accept what has happened. I have to accept that the nightmares will continue for the rest of my life. I have to accept ""the green mile"" I will never be able to identify the people who sexually abused me multiple time. Remember I am not the only sexually abuse male.

PTSD-166,Complex PTSD - What is it and how do we cope?,"'Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD; also known as complex trauma disorder) is a psychological disorder thought to occur as a result of repetitive, prolonged trauma involving sustained abuse or abandonment by a caregiver or other interpersonal relationships with an uneven power dynamic.' Wikipedia description.. I think this pretty much sums it up yeah? I wish I could underline; '..relationships with an uneven power dynamic'. In my own case, C-PTSD was triggered by bullying in my workplace from 2008 until 2014. I developed symptoms such as Anxiety/Panic that grew in severity until a tragic breakdown in 2014. I was forced to medically retire. Although my history of multiple trauma's and childhood abuse caused specific responses in me from an early age, I thought I was normal and everyone was the same. In fact, a lot of people in my inner circle were. Decades later, I find out those friends/family members/acquaintances had gone thru their own traumatic situations. So why wouldn't I feel normal around them? Today, as opposed to the 70's/80's (my adolescence/young adulthood) where abuse wasn't discussed, people have resources to out their pain and confusion in spaces like BB forum or with psychologists, social workers, medico's, psychiatrists and even friends/family. Treatment has become the 'norm' instead of going it alone which is what many of us here had to do until society caught up with this 'pandemic' (IMO) of psychological disorders. So, why create a thread dedicated to C-PTSD? Well, stigma and misconception around it's still rife in our society, and people suffering with this horrible disorder and not realising it is a constant. Your views are absolutely welcome! We really do need to talk about it as consequences of C-PTSD and the benefits of therapy are worthy and an important part of recovery.

PTSD-171,I have complex PTSD. The last few months I seem to be stuck in 'fight or flight' mode.,"I have complex PTSD. The last few months I seem to be stuck in 'fight or flight' mode. Many flashbacks, visual, emotional, physical. The littlest things are difficult to cope with. I start the day with what feels like my cup 90% full. Not wanting to go on is a common feeling/thought. Lonely place to be. I do have a mental health worker and have seen a trauma counsellor once - waiting on further appointments to be scheduled. Had a good GP but he's left and no-one else is available in my small town. I am rambling. I am very proactive and compliant doing all sorts of techniques - grounding, mindfulness, breathing, distraction etc etc. I'm still working and fulfilling what needs to be done in my life. But it's getting harder and harder and I'm getting tired and more tired and more hopeless and feel as if I try and try and nothing is changing. I don't know what I'm asking. I'm doing all the ""things"". I enact my safety plan - call suicide call back service, lifeline. Come away feeling more hopeless. It's hard to get through 5 minutes sometimes. Again I don't know what I'm asking. I seek assistance and there seems no more answers and I'm stuck in this place that is dark and dangerous and lonely. Sorry for such a negative post.

PTSD-174,What the hell is wrong with men in Australia?,"I live in Sydney & the recent incidents of violence against women has prompted me to write this. I am a woman in my mid-fifties (look 10 years younger) living on my own in a villa for nearly 7 years now. I have an obnoxious neighbor, a single man in his seventies whom you could call an incel (involuntary celibate). His villa is next to mine & although he has a backyard, he seems to spend a lot of time in the common area in front of his villa, even sunbathing there in full view. Initially he used to peer in thru my living room blinds till I put up some thick curtains. He then began fiddling with my rubbish bins and putting his rubbish in till I moved the bins into my backyard. He then shifted his attention to my letter box, putting some gum like substance & then sticking newspapers into it. I tried blocking the letter box by filling it up with junk & he would spend hours trying to still push things in. I then realised that there was some sexual innuendo going on. Disgusted I permanently sealed up my letter box and then the next step was that he began stalking me. I also cannot sit in the living room & literally have to tiptoe across the house because if he hears me moving around inside the house, he starts making weird noises. While all this has been happening, to cause me further stress, I also began experiencing sexual harassment at work. The man whom I shall call Geri is 65 & divorced. Geri began leering at & propositioning me since day one and didn’t seem to get the message to back-off even though I told him that I had partner. He would approach me pretending to ask a work-related question all the while staring at my chest. I managed to mitigate the situation by trying to avoid being in the office on the same days as him. What struck me about Geri was his sense of entitlement & his delusions that at 65 he was some kind of catch. Could write a lot more but restricted by the word limit! So, what exactly is wrong with men in AU that they feel the need to control & harass women? It’s bad enough for men to be abusive in a relationship but this post should provide insight into the kind of behavior some women put up with even when they are not in a relationship!! There is talk about educating men but is it really education that is required here? Maybe allowing for video capture of incidents to name & shame would be more effective.",Femina,Community Member,30-04-2024,PTSD and trauma,12,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/what-the-hell-is-wrong-with-men-in-australia/td-p/590392

But even with all the support I have (which I am very grateful for) I just feel really alone and then guilty for feeling alone. My husband suggested I reach out on here and see if anyone else has been in a similar situation.

PTSD-179,How Do You Deal with a Nasty Person? *TRIGGER WARNING*,"Hi lovely people, Some of you here may have followed some of my earlier posts, but I have complex PTSD from years of domestic violence and abuse from my current husband. My anxiety levels are very high right now. Leaving my current living arrangements isn’t an option at the moment or this time in my life. I am 56 and still need to work and somehow run a business with my narcissistic husband. Lately, he is becoming more and more vile and nasty with his words and taunts. He knows how damaged my self esteem and self worth is and he is the cause of this. I try to be civil and reasonable in living under the same roof but he’s getting more and more angry and hostile to the point of yelling at me to move out if I don’t like IT. He has yelled at me several times and lately in front of our sons, aged 27 and 29. HE knows that since giving up my apartment in 2022, I have nowhere to move out to. I don’t have any friends or family contacts or support. Not even a friend to talk to about this. I can’t keep burdening my sons with this. I am scared that he is pushing me to the brink once again. I have come very close to ending my life several times but I can’t do that to my children. I want to live and enjoy watching them grow and hopefully have their own children one day. He’s making me feel like I just want to end it all. Just abandon this life as it’s not ever going to be good. I will always have this trauma to haunt me forever.

PTSD-180,Disclosing CSA To Friends,"Back in 2019, after 16 years I disclosed child sexual abuse to my closest friend. I had always recalled it but I suppose I never processed it since I blamed myself and brushed it aside as not meeting the typical ‘criteria’ of sexual abuse. Initially my friend was supportive but after a few months she began to get frustrated at my seeming lack of progress, I developed an eating disorder, self harm, anxiety, depression, met the criteria of PTSD. I was attending therapy weekly and things were getting sorted, but I guess she couldn’t handle it anymore, she broke off the friendship.So since then I’ve told a few other friends, because sometimes it feels like it’s burning inside and I want to get it out. But every time I tell, I get insecure. What’s more I feel like I shouldn’t bother them with it again, like I’ll ‘use them up’ as I did with my closest friend before. So I end up telling more people than I’d like, just to not burden one. A few weeks ago I was triggered while getting dressed in my wardrobe and recalled a fragmented memory through an emotional flashback. I felt ambivalent about discussing it, still do. But it kept bothering me (and after dismissing my own experiences for so long I tend to seek external validation) so I decided to message a friend who I’d told once before about the CSA. I messaged late at night and she replied in the morning and asked how I was feeling— I responded, and she never replied again. I felt pretty rubbish. After weeks I didn’t want her to try and reply this late, so I messaged about something random and she responded, ignoring my other message. So that’s the story, what I was wondering was…Would you take it as that friend isn’t available for trauma discussion, although they did ask a question?~ Overthinker",Over-thinker,Community Member,28-04-2024,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/disclosing-csa-to-friends/td-p/590211

PTSD-182,What is happening?,"I just need some reassurance,Last August I was feeling very dizzy, lightheaded, my eyes were blurry, i was feeling like i was in a dream, i felt as if i was sick or was dying, honestly every symptom imaginable.. I had all these tests done; MRI, blood tests, heart tracking, etc. I've been to therapy too. I'm only 17 - everyone is telling me i am young and that this is a phase, as it's not like i have had it all my life. Forgot to mention, in August when this started i had the flu for around 2 weeks, i was feeling really sick, one morning i woke up at like 4:00am and went to my parents room, because i had a temperature and i felt sick, whilst i was standing in the dark bedroom i felt nauseous and all sweaty, i felt like i was going to collapse, then i realised everything felt more darker then normal i turned on their light and i couldn't see anything, everything was black! I My mum just said that i wasnt eating and drinking and that is what must've caused it, along with all the medication i was taking. But i happened another time too.. It was around 2:00pm as i was riding my dirt bike, i felt off and wasn't concentrating properly, i fell off at high speed after almost crashing into my sister (i hit the front brakes going downhill, in which i know i wasn't supposed to - i just panicked). Long story short, I broke my wrist, anyways when i fell off i had another blackout, which i was told it was also because it was 2:00pm and i hadn't eaten.. Then not long ago my heart started racing and it happened again. I am literally so scared now, but i've just been told every time this has happened i was because i hadn't eaten properly which is why now i try my best. Anyways, that isn't the point. The point is 2 days ago i got a cold, and i feel so bad, i think it is from my anxiety and my cold together.. But, the thing is. I feel like i can't think properly, i feel really out of it - like i don' feel real, nothing around me feel real. I feel like my head is tight and i am stuck in a dream, i don't feel right, i feel like I'm weak and everything i touch and do it isn't necessarily me that is doing it. So, i don't know if it is because of my cold that is making me feel off and my anxiety that is overexaggerating the feeling i am experiencing, but i feel like something is seriously wrong, what is happening to my brain, i am scared. It doesn't feel like my anxiety where it goes away when i occupy myself. No matter what i do i feel so out of it.

He was supportive, we discussed why I feel so powerless, so angry, and scared all the time.Starting from age 11, I was molested by a teacher for five years, bullied by students from the age of 4, the bullying turned into physical assaults and what one police detective termed as torture, I was sexually assaulted by a friend's boyfriend at age 13, 16, and raped at age 20.

As we all know when we're mentally ill it can be hard to seek ""great, quality help"" quickly. Maybe you can't get in for a few weeks to see a Dr for a psychologist referral. Maybe the psych isn't the right fit. Maybe you can't afford the cost of the dr or the psych.

PTSD-186,I’m overwhelmed,I have finally left my husband of 25 years after years of physical but mainly the mental abuse over the last 2 years. I should be happy that I finally left but I’m not. I hate him what what he did and breaking me like this. I was a strong person and never did I think I would ever feel like this. And yet for some stupid reason I love him and just want him back. I don’t have any friends or family to talk to and this is the first time I’m reaching out like this. I have spoken to someone through this website before but it was a one on one so I don’t know what to expect but I just want to feel like someone cares and smile. A real smile not the fake ones I’ve been giving out for so long now. To top it all off our lease ran out and since Thursday night I have also been staying in my car with my 2 dogs. Thought camping would be fun but didn’t count in them being so protective that no living soul can walk past if in sight and the poor ducks didn’t deserve the scare they got. One of the dogs broke her collar and runner trying to give chase. I feel just as stressed here as I did at home. I don’t have anyone to talk to and the fact that I’m feeling hate and love for the one person that’s been in my life since I was 15 is just adding to the stress because all it’s doing is confusing me and making me angry or upset. At the moment I feel like I’m all cried out and I feel so down. I went to a quiet part of the river and I’m on my own here which is great for when I just get overwhelmed and have a cry but I wish there was Simone here who just pretends to care. Someone that could help me feel better. I’m sorry if this is too long and boring. I feel like a hug so badly.

PTSD-188,Generational effects,"Only recently my mother passed away, 12 years after my father, they had been divorced for years and the marriage was not positive shall we say, my mother had some emotional issues and sort attention where she could, my father was overbearing and their marriage was splattered with random events of violence, my elder brother bought into my father's view of the world and my mother, whereas for some reason I was on the outer with him, the accusation quite often thrown my way was ""your just like your mother"" in various negative formats, so I developed a distance between myself and my mother, I was never close to my father or my brother yet it is interesting to me that to all their circles they were perceived to be great guy's. I copped quite a bit from my father on occasion with at one stage having my upper thigh & bum almost completely black with bruising, I have seen my brother take his stepson into a room with the son emerging with a black eye when he slipped and ""fell"" on the bedpost, but the one I feel for the most is my mother, she went through her entire life being rejected by those around her, she was promoted to everyone as ""OH that's just her!"" by her family, by her husband and then her children, she faced physical violence when he was drunk or feeling bad, she was a timid soul and must have been scared witless at times by my fathers ""Righteous"" rage when confronted with a cold or dried out dinner because he had spent the evening drinking, she faced being put down her entire life, but the worst I think that was done to her was to have her children turn on her as my brother did or turn away as I did, most of this I only realized after she had died to my shame, we kids were weaponized by a parent in his one sided war against the person he should have loved and supported, now I am left with regret, and a struggle to reconcile and process a lifetime of trauma, however I have broken that cycle of violence and need for power and control, my family although not perfect is relatively normal and my children are much better parents than I ever could be, but now I grieve for what could have been, for my mother , for me , for my children as we were robbed of the opportunity to have a relationship across those generations by domestic & mental violence,",BLine,Community Member,20-04-2024,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/generational-effects/td-p/589649
PTSD-189,sexual assault,"i was sexually assaulted last year when i was still 15. this man and i talked for months and he treated me horribly so we took some time apart. eventually we came back and by this time i had healed and gained so much self worth. i set my boundaries and he surprisingly respected them, i was so happy with myself. my first encounter with him after setting my boundaries was a sexual assault which involved him jumping the fence and telling me to keep my mouth shut. i didn’t react for a couple of weeks, i think i was just processing what had happened and why i was taking way too many showers every night. one night i cracked and confronted him and to be honest i felt no glory in being proven right as he said “please **** please **** don’t tell anyone” i couldn’t do anything. couldn’t say a word because i would be called a liar, couldn’t over react because people would think i was asking for sympathy, couldn’t tell my friends because he was in our group. couldn’t tell mum because i felt so ashamed and disgusted in myself. i struggled for months and my grades dropped as well as my relationships. i cut everyone out and lost myself completely. i realised that after all those months of worthlessness and depression i hadn’t gained any justice because that boy was still walking around thinking i had let him off easy. i’m yet to report the case or tell half of my family and friends but i’ve come to terms with myself and that i deserve better than any man with similar intentions. although it stops me from experimenting with relationships it also stops me from getting more hurt and that’s been my main priority since the assault. teenage girls don’t get enough of a voice for this kind of thing because it’s NOT normal and shouldn’t be brushed off the shoulder. i’m now completing year 11 and trying to get myself back on track with grades and trusting those around me.

PTSD-191,ptsd and triggers,"I have a lot of childhood trauma including coca(child on child abuse), sa, loss of loved ones, emotional/physical abuse.This caused very bad flashbacks in episodes at nighttime for a long time, though I've been healing and it's been a while since I've had one of those now. But a lot of music from those years still triggers episodes of ptsd where I can feel, hear and smell my abuser. It's horrible and uncontrollable. Luckily, music from then doesn't get played that often, so I'm usually fine, and I tend to carry earbuds with me in case.Sadly, I still get into fights/arguments with my parents, which can trigger a lot of emotional distress and cause a spiral into a major depressive episode. These episodes often consist of memories/flashbacks to those I've lost to time and can also trigger a ptsd episode to the abuse. My mother has anger issues that she refuses to adress and my father has chronic pain issues that cause him an amount of depression and can also make him prone to anger as well. So what should, i think, just end up being a playful disagreement which we all come out of understanding one another better and as better peopple, usually spirals into a big fight that usually ends with me in tears and not being able to stand in the same room. I always have to leave to try calm down, though by then it's usually too late to sotp the spiral. I am clean of self harm over two years now and I am so proud of myself for it, but these fights with my parents keep getting worse as I gain self confidence, self respect, and knowledge of what's normal and not in people as I get older. I know my home will never be violent, but I know my parents don't like that I like guys and girls, or that I am sometimes a girl and sometimes a guy. and a part of me always worrie that the fights could turn physical one day, even if rationally I know they won't.

I'm now 22, I struggle with anxiety about basically everything as I've had such a sheltered life and no real experiences. I left school at the age of 12 due to my home life. Something I regret immensely. But I've spent all my time since 16 sitting in my bathroom smoking, every single day. I don't have friends, hobbies, activities I do outside of being at home. I basically go to the shops every week for food shopping then straight back home. My health is getting worse, my teeth are becoming black and I've recently just lost half of one at the back causing so much pain. Due to that I've had a realisation my life is headed no where. How do I get out of this funk of always smoking, feeling like I need it but not doing anything with my life. How do I commit to a full-time job when I've never had any sort of commitments like that before. I struggle to adjust to the thought of spending 8+hours a day at work and having barely and time for myself but on the other hand having no money for dental, a house to live in, a car.. I feel so lost. Like I'm the only one who's messed there life up so terribly that it feels irreversible.

My wife is looking after me as a full-time carer.I'm struggling to find a structured way back to my normal self. I'm sleeping very little, constantly mulling everything over in my head.

PTSD-195,Finding myself,"I've had a lifetime of struggles and I'm still struggling with the aftermath of how people have treated me. Growing up I was the oldest of many siblings in which we had a abusive farther and a abused mother. My farther physically, mentally, and sexually abused me up until the age of 15 until I had finally had enough. He physically and mentally abused my siblings. I spent my childhood confused and hurt and now from my recent understanding I had autism. I did everything I could and took as much as his rage from my siblings I've done, been through and seen things that the average person don't understand. I've had 2 siblings go through cancer. A mother that's incapable of not only looking after herself let alone anyone else. I had a child young for which I found out my ex purposely pregnated me so I wouldnt leave. For which he turned into my farther and mentally, physically and sexually abused me aswell. Until I finally couldn't take it anymore just over 2 years ago and disconnected and shut down for which I finally walked away. I've not cone to the understanding I have autism cptsd, ocd, anxiety, severe depression. I've entered a new relationship for which I now no that my trauma from the past is effectively rising up. I have bouts of crying all the time. I struggle with communication, eye contact. Over explain and talking but to softly. People pleasing issues. Emotionally intense. Severe inner personal critic, abandonment issues and the list goes on and on. It would be great to find people who lived similar situations to provide how they have overcome even some of these things and how? I'm scared alot, I get triggered regularly and there is next to no support available just wait lists everywhere. I'd like to feel safe to discuss the things I went through is this the place or is there advice on where I can speak my truth to maybe get it off my chest and relieve some of this pressure cooker thoughts so I can see if that may free me even just a little. I've struggled with sharing as the experiences I went through I can't find people who actually understand without crying.

PTSD-196,PTSD & Children,"I recently had two scares within a week where I nearly lost my 7 week old baby. I struggled with fertility for years, multiple losses & then I finally fell pregnant. Pregnancy was traumatic in itself as I was high risk the entire time always terrified I’d lose her. I was diagnosed with antenatal anxiety. The moment I knew she was coming I was filled with anxiety that I may reject her because of how anxious I had been but I couldn’t have been more wrong. I fell inlove with her from the moment I saw her. I was so happy & full of life just because of one little lady who can’t even speak to me. Until a week ago, I was changing her & she vomited, choked & turned blue. She was unresponsive but only for 30 seconds. When she came too I was obviously terrified but was relieved. I saw the hospital who advised everything was semi okay & she had just had a reaction to her vaccinations that caused her throat to close. This brought on a lot of anxiety & instilled fear into me but after 2-3 days I started to feel more confident again. Until, yesterday. I was holding her, she was just drifting off to sleep when not even 30 seconds later I realised she wasn’t breathing. She was limp & blue. I immediately dialled 000 & the ambulance came. After 6 minutes fully unconscious she came too, but was in & out of consciousness. This was absolutely terrifying for me, I was breaking down when the ambulance arrived & took her. I couldn’t stand to think of my life without her, she almost died in my arms. What if I was sleeping & I never noticed? I since then have been in the hospital with her where she has been okay & is just being monitored. No one knows whats wrong. I am terrified. I keep having flashbacks, nightmares & getting chills. I can’t hold her because I see her body pale. I have PTSD which I am no stranger too but never like this. None of the trauma I have been through is like this. This feeling is indescribable. I am not sure where to start. I don’t have the answers to heal yet but I can’t physically or mentally live how I am after this. I can’t sleep, eat & I can’t stop crying. My brain has gone over the worst multiple times, preparing myself for what may be. What would you call this? How do I deal with this? I am so scared.

PTSD-197,Finding Myself,Hi Everyone I haven't been on for a while but I felt an urge to come and and make a post. So here goes. I have had personal experience with Anxiety and PTSD and Depression. So I wanted to get my expression of my thoughts out there in the hope it can change other people's lives for the better. I felt very lost for a really long time I also felt that I couldn't really turn to anyone because I felt they truly wouldn't understand me. I relied on the professionals and my incredibly faith that I have. When you are going through such intense pain suffering and struggles you do not know how you can overcome it. But just know when you feel like you have it rock bottom and feel like you can't get any lower than the only way is up from there. I know this because I've been there. In those moments when you feel so incredibly alone that all you have left is your faith which I've always had faith I just got lost along the way for quite a while. But when I was in solitude I prayed with everything in me that my life was going to get better and that's what I literally hung on to was Faith and Hope and I do believe in miracles because im a living testament to this. It's my hope through my personal journey thus far that it will give other people the hope and courage to hang on and know it can and does get better. It hasn't come easy for me at all and I've worked bloody hard to turn my life around. And I know if gusts will and determination and the will to fight anything is literally possible. All the very best please takecare of yourselves and know you are incredibly deserving and worthy of all the love and happiness in this world.

PTSD-198,Should I Open The Unconscienced Mind About SA,"Hi All, I am a 50yo man. Recently I have started with a new Psychologist, and she started asking me questions about my childhood. It would seem that I might be repressing events that might have happened to me at a very young age that are in my unconscious mind. There is known childhood sexual abuse by a grandparent in the family so this could be what’s in there.The moment she started exploring the topic I had an emotional (tears) and physical reaction (couldn’t sit still/squirming in the chair).I am not sure if I want to open up, as this could be very painful to explore. At the moment I don’t know if I was abused, or I saw something or I just think it happened to me.I appreciate everyone is different, but I would like to know what others think, is opening up beneficial?I am also not sure if I should be discussing things with my wife and kids as I go through this, after all, I don’t really know what happened so there is nothing to discuss really, I do have symptoms, such as mood swings, some alcohol use, a lot of anxiety so I think I should be saying something?",B-1472,Community Member,02-04-2024,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/should-i-open-the-unconscienced-mind-about-sa/td-p/588278
PTSD-199,Sexual Abuse,Hi Everyone im going to post on here something that is incredibly difficult for me to do. But I feel it's the only way I can get out whats inside of me. So here goes I was abused as a child and being abused as a child is on a whole different level to being hurt in anyway as an adult. I was abused not once but twice. First by the one person in my life that I believed was supposed to be there to keep me safe and protect me. Then again from an outsider. So yes you could say my whole world had literally had falling apart. And that is such and overwhelming and intense place to come back from. But what scared me even more was allowing these people to win over me. So I literally fought for my life tooth and nail to crawl my way back from the depths of hell and such despair in my life. Please if anyone can take anything away from my personal experiences in my life. Then I feel I am doing the right thing here. I truly hope this is not to confronting for everyone but I feel I needed to share this. Please takecare because mental health is so important and it should take precedence in your life. Please takcare everyone. Hope,Geniue,Community Member,31-03-2024,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sexual-abuse/td-p/588105
PTSD-200,Partner has relapsed- Porn Addiction,"Hi, I didn't really know where to turn to or reach out for support, but I'm hoping I can get some advice from here. My partner and I have been together for nearly 6 years and got married 3 weeks ago. For about 2-3 years I've known that my partner is actually addicted to porn, and it wasn't until the end of last year that he came to the realisation too. He has finally started getting professional help and had even made it 3 months with watching or viewing anything. I was so incredibly proud of him, and I could tell that our relationship was growing healthy and stronger because of it. However, a few days ago I realised be started acting really distant. He has had allot of stress recently due to work, study and outside family pressure. I tried to push past it, but looking back, I probably could have done more to have seen what was really happening and I could have helped. Last night we started to become intimate, and for the first time in our whole relationship, my partner was struggling to perform. We obviously stopped cause it was clear something was wrong. I still found this a little strange. I had to pry over and over before he finally told me the truth. 4 days earlier he had watched porn, and now he had been watching for the past 4 days. Pretty heavily too. I was so upset and angry. I felt disgusted and wanted to yell. However, I didn't. I've done some research over the past few months and understand that's its in times like this that he needs my support to get through. So I pushed all my feeling aside, and we stayed up all night talking about what happened, why he relapsed and what we can now do to help him. By the way he was acting this morning, I can tell he is trying his best to be positive. However, I'm really struggling. I don't want to turn to him for support cause I don't want to burden him when he is already going through so much. To make matters worse, I have a history of self-harm and suicide, and this whole situation has triggered those feeling of not being enough and feeling like I'm not worthy. I don't know how I'm suppose to be reacting to his relapse and I don't know what to do with my emotions. I want to help him through this journey, and I feel like I've got no one to support me. But I don't know if that sounds selfish of not. I guess I'm just looking for advice on how I should look after myself during this time and what I can do to cope? Any advice would be helpful, or even if people have gone through something similar that would help. I think it is punching a little harder too cause it's his first relapse.

PTSD-201,CPTSD Nightmares,"As a child I had nightmares from a very early age. I would often have the same nightmare over and over. I won’t go into details but they involved severe threat of inescapable annihilation and obliteration. I can still get these same dreams now that are versions of these childhood dreams. They have come and gone over different periods of my life. Over the past 5 months I’ve been in a nightmare phase again. I’ve been woken by two last night which is pretty normal at present. Other times I go through phases where I haven’t had nightmares and thought to myself, I don’t really get nightmares, like I forget the fact that I have had bouts of them. I think this is a kind of dissociation where I blank out the experiences. Then I am plunged back into them again. I am wondering if others have found or learned strategies for managing nightmares with PTSD or CPTSD? I just read about an interesting therapeutic approach this morning. It’s called Image Rehearsal Therapy. What you do is write out the dream but with a different non-scary story where there is a safe, positive resolution. I am going to try this. It sounds similar to the Somatic Experiencing work I have done where you go through a re-enactment of a past trauma where you get to act out the actions of self-protection and escape you never got to do at the time of an incident. At the moment I have a lot of terror all day everyday and then it manifests even when I’m asleep. In the last 5 months I sleep between about 3-6 hours most nights. I often then sleep in the afternoon and have strange, disturbing dreams then too. I guess I’m wondering if anyone has overcome their nightmares and if so what seemed to help?",Eagle Ray,Valued Contributor,02-03-2024,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/cptsd-nightmares/td-p/586398
PTSD-202,Did I do something wrong? Am I at fault?,"Recently, I got into an awkward situation with my tutor, who I have become friends with over the sessions. We still got work done and had friendly conversations about things that were about our personal lives. Overtime I also started developing feelings for him but never said anything. Then last month he was telling me that he was in his girlfriend's house and that they started dating 5 weeks ago and how they met through mutual friends. I was sad but happy for him too. I noticed over the online tutoring session, he started whispering at random times. I asked him whether or not he was ok but he just said ""I'm just talking to myself and I guess to you."" He noticed I was upset and asked me if I was ok twice. I then said I'm ok and that sometimes I worry about making him feel awkward about saying things that might be too personal. He then said ""I know that I'm your tutor, my time is paid and I'm a bit older than you, but if you need me, I can be your friend"". Then I said that I was going to be sad about him leaving to the UK. Then he said ""Don't worry, I'll be back next year"". I was then given hope that he'd like to be friends with me after tutoring and my final year of high school, which is what I'd like since we have spoken about our personal lives and got closer. Then, I mentioned the whispering in our next session and he gave me a different answer saying ""I was just upset, that you were upset"". Then the next session, I opened about my concerns of his relationship since I have never heard him whispering over a zoom and he gave me different answers to it and his relationship seemed to have progressed really fast. He then got defensive and started telling me that we shouldn't talk about our personal relationships and getting into our personal lives will complicate things because he is my tutor. He then said ""I know I said 'Don't worry, I'll see you again next year' but I said it because I say it out of habit to my friends who say the same thing but I never see my students again after the HSC"". I was just sitting there feeling really awkward when he said that because we have spoken about personal topics and he knew that I broke up with an ex boyfriend because he was toxic (He never said anything about discussing personal topics for the past 9 months of our tutoring sessions until now). Plus, you don't just say ""Don't worry, I'll see you again next year when you dont feel close to someone or see them as only a student"". I felt like I was given false hope and thought I was a friend to him. I also started suspecting that something is fishy, maybe the relationship. My friends also agree something is weird. At this point I am questioning whether or not to say anything about feeling awkward to my tutor or leave it. Did I do something wrong here? Is there something that is my fault and I'm not aware of it?",Ginger_roll,Community Member,09-08-2023,PTSD and trauma,16,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/did-i-do-something-wrong-am-i-at-fault/td-p/572071
PTSD-203,Is this common or its only me .......,"I am 33 years old married for 9 years and have 2 beautiful kids. I am experiencing so void in my married life. My husband is well educated and hard working guy. He loves his kids and can do anything for them as far as I know him. Its his behaviour with me, he is always busy working or on call with his friends. He never touch me or hug me ( he touch me when we have sex) But like normally he never holds my hand or say anything that can show his affection towards me. I work full time mostly from home as my husband but we barely talk. He talk to his friends and family all day long on phone (not sure if this is normal). when ever we fight he accuse me of being possessive and say that I do not want him to go out even say so many mean things eg, ""You are a Zero"", ""you do not have any friends"", ""you are brainless"" , ""you are not a good wife"", ""you do not like my family"". But I never have a issue if he go out with his friends once in a week but my problem is he never ask me to go out with him we never went to a romantic dinner or just night out after we had kids. My whole day I work take care of kids , clean the house, make the meals and sleep ( once in a while we have sex). its not that we never had good time we do but now its like we are too busy earning money and saving money that there is no value for emotions. some time I feel like I do not want to live like that and just kill my self but then I think about my kids. sometime I cant breath thinking that one day my husband and I will get divorce.

PTSD-204,Emotional torment from Narcissistic Mother,"Long story, sorry! Am in such torment. I'm 50 and my mother (now 79) is a narcissist and emotionally abusive my entire life. My Dad left so it was just her and I. As a child, I had to pretty much parent myself, her behaviour was childish and neglectful. As a result of her neglect, I ended up experiencing trauma at other's hands, several times which only adds to my PTSD. She provided shelter, meals, clothing, and even gifts for Xmas/birthdays But couldn't provide love or interest in me. She used emotional manipulation and a lot of guilting - eg: telling me ""Maybe she should just kill herself"" if I disagreed with her. If I were upset, she'd call me a baby and tell me she had it worse her whole life. I became a perfectionist, trying to be perfect in every way. I became overly caring with everyone to the point of neglecting myself and my own needs. Still, due to crushing guilt, I kept her in my life and my children's lives. She continued to rage at me, in front of them for silly issues (always when my husband wasn't present). She snooped in my passwords book and read all my emails in my account, logged into my FB account from her computer and had access for a year before I realised. She told me she hadn't felt love for me since I was a child, she mocked me mercilessly when I cried, mimicking my voice and tears even in front of my kids. There is so, so much more but too much to write here. Every now and then she will act nice and send a gift or a card, but whenever I ask her to acknowledge the hurt she's caused me, she goes silent and she has never uttered the word sorry in her life, she tells me I am the disturbed, crazy one and I need help, not her. In 2012 I moved with my husband and children to Australia (I am from the US) - for a better life and to be away from her. I have tried to extend olive branches at times, photos and updates of the kids, trying to visit when back in the US. It has always ended badly and with me in tears. Nothing I do is ever enough for her. A visit is ""bad"" because if I don't give her all of my time on a visit I am horrible. I'm going home for a visit soon. She has had other email me and bash me for not giving her enough time when I get home. They don't believe she's abusive and told me I am selfish. Now I am not seeing her but the guilt is crushing me...to death. She just wrote that she's 79 and might die soon and I'll be sorry when she is on her deathbed (she's currently very healthy). But I feel crushing guilt. Help.",suzie2,Community Member,29-05-2023,PTSD and trauma,33,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/emotional-torment-from-narcissistic-mother/td-p/566543

PTSD-207,"Work sucks, I know..","So. I thought I was lucky. Job I loved. Amazing team working for me. Made a difference to the company. Smashing it. Finally I was someone my kids could be proud of. I own my own home. None of this came easy. I have a really dark past. I used to be someone I didn't like but I grew up. I didn't let trauma dictate my future or make me be who I could have become. I put my big girl boots on. I studied doing a bachelor of social science. With the intention of helping people I ended up in a factory job as a supervisor due to financial circumstances. There was someone at work who really needed my help. To give her some hope i even took her on as my 2ic. I went above and beyond. Anyway they ended up making some really bad decisions. Im talking fire on the spot call the cops and child protection. I continued to support for 2 years.So now she wants my job. Said it to my face in front of someone.All this time later and many many instances in between I am now in trouble for finally snapping and saying a few immature words. Yeah I know. Not great on my behalf.(This is where the trauma and ptsd kicks in).Who knew working with your abusive nasasitic pathetic excuses of a mother who kicked you out at 14 to have a better life with her boyfriend would suck so much. But now it looks like she is the flavour of the week and I will be loosing my job my home everything. All for what. Being kind to someone and trying to help them out is in my blood. I would probably do it again.The question now is. Do I be a role model for all the other people and the toxic place I work and risk losing it all or say my bad suck it up and continue in a job where I no longer feel safe, appreciate or basically human.I have gone from being ok to really not ok. I'm not ok I can't afford to loose my job but I can't let them win. It would crush my sole and everything I believe in. Oh but the way I have a 11 page file on everything she has done to me.

Then I took my PRN... after a few minutes it felt like the memory was just being zapped from the inside out. The noise was becoming quieter, the image started fading out and it came in short bursts rather than like watching a movie.

PTSD-212,When does it stop?,"I was born into abuse. Not as bad as some, worse then others. I can't remember loosing my virginity, or who took it but I know I was very young. I was molested and raped by my family from before I can remember until the start of my teens. Tried to speak with my mother when I was very young, I was told boys are boys. Later to keep quiet and that it's over. Don't break the family. My dad left when I was 11. Overseas, started a new family. Left us with mum. She was an addict, neglectful and abusive. She tried to murder me. My brother, my rapist, saved me. Mum had countless boyfriends. Abusive relationships, both sides. Years of listening to screaming, physical fights, violent sex and mental breakdowns. Years of suicide threats and uncontrolled rage, jealousy, hate. Had two younger sisters I tried to shield. But ran when I was 15. My sister's both ended up being molested. One by my mother herself. Ended up in an abusive relationship with my first. 8 years later and 2 girls, I left. Had a good career and beautiful children. Chose to do better and did. Married my childhood best friend. Wanted a fairytale and ignored a lot of red flags. Started intensive trauma therapy, after a year I was given an ultimatum to let him know about my past, be apart of the therapy or end things. I worked with my therapist for months to get the courage. Wrote a letter to my mother confronting her. She was still in my life. They all were. I told him. He said I was disgusting. That he didn't sign up for my trauma. That he would share my letter on social media to show the world how f----d up I was. I didn't understand. We had a little boy and the girls were so happy and loved him deeply as a step dad, I was a wonderful partner but he thought I was dirty. Used and broken. So I moved on. I shared my story with my whole family. Put out into the open everything that had happened, what they had done and the pain and grief that it has caused me. And I was cut away. Called a liar. My mum tells people that I had my brother at my wedding, I had him near my children - my rapist - that I chose it, that I'm a terrible mother, neglectful, abusive, can't hold together a relationship. Pathetic. A wh--e. She is dying now. She was diagnosed with advanced MS, with multiple lesions on her brain. We haven't spoken in years, I'm off social media, blocked her from all my accounts but occasionally she gets a message through, just to call me something. Tell me she hates me. It was my birthday two days ago, she commemorated it by making sure I got a message calling me awful names, a f--- up, a bad mother. That she is dying and she'll hate me until the end. Never own it. Never be sorry. Decades of therapy. Medications. I do so well. Have an amazing job, am a great mother, a good person. But I have flashbacks and nightmares. I feel like a can't breathe sometimes. I feel hollow at other times. I know what it all is. But I'm just sitting here thinking, I'm tired. Life's been really hard. And I've done a really good job to get here, for the kids, they're ok. If I died now, theyd be ok. I've set them up financially, with love, with strength, with each other. I could go and these episodes... Fighting this battle again the utter worthlessness, hopelessness and soul wrenching pain will be done. Because I know now it won't go away. It will always be here. I will never find peace with this and fighting my mind, finding the strength to choose to continue and look for happiness is exhausting. I feel like I've fought hard enough now.",-Bee,Community Member,15-02-2024,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/when-does-it-stop/td-p/585216
PTSD-213,"Abusive Ex is now in jail, I feel weird about it","Hi all! It's been a little while since I've started a new post because I've been extremely lucky in that everything has been going well. However I found out on Saturday night that my ex partner is now in jail and it kind of threw me for a loop. We were together 9 years and he always battled addiction and obeying the law. In the end his ice addiction changed him and he became physically and emotionally abusive towards me, even putting me in hospital twice and cheating on me. Leaving was hard because I loved the person he was before drugs but it was the best thing I ever did as the person he became was hurting me a lot. I don't love him any more and have had no contact since leaving (about 7 months ago), I have an amazing boyfriend now and have well and truly moved on from the past but I don't understand my feelings when finding out about his situation especially because everyone saw it coming, including me. I feel shocked, sad but also overwhelmed with relief that I don't have to be the one picking up the pieces for him while he was in jail. I feel devastated for the person I once knew, despite the fact that he hadn't been that person for at least 18 months due to his ice use. His sister has tried to contact me but I don't want to see his family because I want to leave him and any ties to him in the past but is that selfish of me? After I left, all I felt was anger and resentment for him and didn't care at all about what happened to him. But now that something has happened, I feel sad? And although I feel sad, I still have no desire at all to make contact with him or see him. I'm confused about my own emotions which is frustrating. I've been talking to family and friends about it but everyone seems to think I should be so happy with him being in jail after what he did to me and of course, his own actions put him there but I just don't feel happy about it. Always grateful to be able to vent here : ) Lots of love Gem",GemAndLogan,Blue Voices Member,19-09-2017,PTSD and trauma,11,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/abusive-ex-is-now-in-jail-i-feel-weird-about-it/td-p/322677
PTSD-214,DID - confusing thoughts about switching,"Hi all,I am recognised as having DID. I am still very much in the start of the process of learning about how we work and and working on communication, connection etc. I am not pursuing an official diagnosis as there are already enough issues experienced due to other conditions/diagnoses. Anyway the point of this post is I am wondering if any others with DID or OSDD have experienced blocking or distracting away from switches because you feel like it is 'weak' to 'give in' to a switch? Previously there has been fear and shame and things like that, but this seems to be new. We have discussed briefly in therapy, but didn't come up with any ideas. There is still lots of doubt & denial being worked through, so perhaps it is related to that?

PTSD-215,Seeking help finding online or phone psychiatrist support services.,"Hello, Seeking help to find appropriate support services in South Australia. I about 30 years ago I have endured significant violent trauma. Witnessing violent death perpetrated by strangers. All my life I've lived with a physical difference in my brain that contributes to anger, anxiety, depression, learning difficulties and poor adaptation to change. My brain is physically reactive. As I've gotten older, my abilities to manage memories has become increasingly difficult, re-sending events and night terrors. These terrors lead to or contribute to significant seizures that are causing injuries ranging from milder ones like bruises to recently fractured vertebra. Does anyone know of a psychiatriac online or phone service in South Australia or Nationally who can work with my psychiatrist to help manage issues as they arise?",Mc_fluffy,Community Member,02-03-2024,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/seeking-help-finding-online-or-phone-psychiatrist-support/td-p/586443

PTSD-218,Then I had my daughter,"I’ve grown up with trauma my whole life. So many people would comment you’re such a strong person and so resilient. These people knew most of my traumas but not all. its true, I am, I was a strong female who had compassion but never allowed anyone to treat me badly. Yet as a child I was treated so badly and allowed it. Being manipulated to feel that I was the problem. I grew up and had great relationship and then found my husband. We had 2 boys and life was amazing. Then I had my daughter and the secret trauma I pushed to one side and never told anyone resurfaced like a tsunami and flash backs began. They influenced me in ways I couldn’t imagine and I became someone I didn’t know. Constant fear and dread. You see I was sexually abused by my 2 brothers at a young age. I never told a sole. My beautiful boys I would now look at as predators. It’s not there fault but I grew up thinking it was not my brothers fault. They didn’t know any better. 1 is a bad bad person who we have all disowned. The other is a manipulative narcissistic person. My other brother- was my protector. Not perfect but always my protector.the trauma and flashbacks wouldn’t disappear and my dependency on alcohol and stimulants surfaced. No one knows. They see me as a strong independent amazing mum. Which I am but the trauma is eating away. I confided in my husband and best friend and they have been so supportive and said it explains so much. Why I continued to allow the manipulator brother dictate to me. I don’t want to tell anyone else but am stuck in this merry go round of trauma. I’ve since lost my dad who was my hero and feel broken. Therapists can’t help. I know it was never my fault. I was too young to understand. But fear for my daughter 24/7. It’s crippling.

PTSD-219,PTSD Compo and Centrelink,"Former bottle shop attendant for a well known chain. I have recently been through 2 hold ups and going through a pretty tough time trying to recover. My problem is that i am no longer with my employer but i still receive help from The private Compo insurer for medical visits , expenses etc. This means i receive an updated work cover certificates after every visit with my GP. As I'm no longer with my employer and i get no financial help from the Compo Insurer I now rely on help through Centrelink. This is where the system is wrong and i get no help from Centrelink. I recently talked to a Centrelink Social Worker and asked to join a DES Service Provider Program to help me get back to work or try to go back to work only to find that i can't do that because i need a medical Certificate. My doctor won't give me a certificate because I'm on Work Cover and she said it is against the law to give me a Certificate for Centrelink while I'm on the Work Cover Certificate. So even though I'm Receiving regular help From my Psychologist and GP and on medication I am not classed as sick through Centrelink's eyes and have been asked to apply for so many jobs every month to the point that i was with my Service Provider the other day and she asked why I'm not applying for Phone canvassing Jobs. I looked at her and replied that i would be no good at doing phone Work as i can't even talk to someone on the Phone without shaking. She then said well why have you been applying for Delivery Driver Jobs if you can't talk on the phone. With tears in my eyes i looked at her and said at least I'm Trying. I just feel like I'm going backwards in trying to recover and I'm in a very emotional state at the moment and some days i can't stop crying. The Compo Insurer has promised me to help me with a back to work plan but I've been waiting for 6 weeks now. So with no help from either end I'm stuck in the middle of a system that does not help the sick. I don't want to be on Centrelink but have no choice and all i ask is for some help with getting me back in the work force. The Disability Work Provider (Des) said i need a Medical Certificate to Join there Service. I just think it's so wrong that even though i have proof of my sickness that no one can help me with me in trying to get back to work. Has anyone else been through this and have any answers for me.

Before my Parents divorced I was 13 yrs old my father took me away to QLD and this is where the memory starts , I’m sitting on a bed and the tv is on and “Pretty Baby “was on my father comes out of the bathroom wearing just a towel and asks if I want a glass of wine , I said ok and he kept giving wine . All of this is in the third person as in from behind me like someone else is watching this . I never told anyone cause when ever I remembered this it didn’t know if it ever happened but I always felt anxious when it resurfaced. I also had another image where I was laying on the bed naked with my eyes closed and my father was touching me but it was viewed from above once again like through someone else’s eyes. The last thing I remember about that trip was waking up at home ( we lived in NSW ) .My father was physically abusive and an alcoholic we were always walking around on eggshells . My Mum passed away in 2019 and my world crumbled, Mum and I talked all the time yes we argued but she was everything to me so this is where everything unraveled. I went to the doctors and was diagnosed with depression and was put on tablets and told to talk to a psychologist, we talked for a few months and was diagnosed with CPTSD & Generalised Anxiety Disorder. I had never told anyone about what I had remembered until I saw a psychiatrist I told her about the one where he was coming out the bathroom and she said that it was definitely a memory .

PTSD-223,The void,"Hi guys. I don’t really know how to start this. I guess it’s complicated. I have no intention to harm myself and when I talk about how I feel it’s always the constant worry but that isn’t what I plan to do. I just feel like this world isn’t for me. I feel like I am out of my body in a way-looking at myself and everybody around me and I don’t understand how or why I’m involved in any of it. I’m very intelligent-so I’ve been told and I look at socioeconomic spaces and society and media and I think the good and bad in the world and the rollercoaster of life is too much and I want to get off the rollercoaster and just feel peace (peace alive not unalive) I don’t see myself being able to feel safe in a relationship to start a family because I self sabotage due to fear of abandonment. I don’t want to work everyday of my life because I have worked so hard and am a good worker and I’m not cared for in jobs like I care for jobs so what’s the point. I’m studying a degree that I’m passionate about but it’s in a negative work environment (hospital/healthcare) I care so much and I wish I just cared a normal amount. I know I’m not the only one to feel like this but for myself I’m sick of being in such a negative space and I feel like I’m drowning and stuck in a pit of darkness. I have had these depression episodes on and off my whole life. 6 months of the year I’m off work due to depression. Real depression and not laziness. I have been told I have major depression, mild anxiety and complex ptsd due to some physical abuse and a LOT of verbal abuse and manipulation in childhood. CBT therapy dosent really work for me and idk what else is there to help. Trust me, I’m not a lazy person and have tried the whole meditation, self help books, CBT therapy, medication, look you name it-I’ve worked really hard at it. I’m 28 years old and all I want to do and all I do is sleep lately and most of the time anyway just worse other times. 13-14 hours a day because I don’t want to feel anything. I don’t know what else to do. I’m lost and yes I know it sounds really terrible like I will hurt myself but I don’t want to and won’t do it I’m just screaming for help at this point and looking for a way to stop hating myself and the world and being so negative.

PTSD-224,Tired of trying to ignore childhood SA,"Hi out there. I am a 45 year old man and have worked hard to build my life, but for some reason the memories of my childhood SA have been coming on stronger and more frequently that it's becoming hard to ignore them and keep moving forward. My older brother and a friend's dad separately groomed and SA'd me from about the ages of 5 to 12. I never felt comfortable with it but went along so I wouldn't get in trouble, as they told me that would happen if I didn't play along. When I had just turned 14, a 19 yo neighbour who i liked, trusted and thought was a friend coerced me and technically took my 'adult virginity' I guess, but then moved and never made contact again. After that, I was scared to trust people but eventually let myself get into a relationship at 21, which took a few years to get comfortable with. Since then, i've fought hard to ignore and I guess repress the SA I went through as a child, and it's worked out pretty ok until now as I've focused on building my life up. But over the last 12 months the SA memories have been coming back stronger and stronger and I'm just getting so tired of trying to repress them. It's definitely affecting my mood at times. I worry it's affecting my partner and relationship. Sex has an element of fear about it these days. I know I should talk about this stuff professionally but that just feels like a very long and horribly uncomfortable road to go down, and I feel massive anxiety at the thought of seeking that kind of help. I've never told anyone about this stuff, and feel hesitant to even write it here, but I'm not sure what else to do.",Drewboy ,Community Member,18-02-2024,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/tired-of-trying-to-ignore-childhood-sa/td-p/585441

PTSD-226,Domestic Violence,So it all just came to a end my fiancée had anoth psychotic episode on Sunday night came home was angry he walked away and chilled and then made me my favourite dinner fish and prawns which was weird for never cooks and brought to me and was so loving and sweet the man I feel in love with. then he went and had shower and went and watched tv and then came into our room raging and smashing everything up and put he hands on me. He then walked away and called the police saying I assaulted him when he knows he already has a DVO and I think was his breaking out to protect me for knew they would arrest him and knows I video everything when has his episodes. He has had a change in his medication over a year ago for doctor lost license and since they changed it has been having these episodes and is total different person I don’t even recognise anymore. I have kept trying all I can to get him to get help and we can go together to a new doctor and or a clinic for financially I could support us just wanted him back to the man I feel I love with but he thought he could fix himself and still it kept happening .. and I kept blaming the meds and kept trying to help .. so the police came took him away and I just kept telling them I don’t want him in jail just needs to get medication in rehab sorted.. they then called a family member of mine and they had to take me to the station and i had to make a report of that night then they saw more photos and videos from last 14 months and now has many chargers against him. The house he brought 8 months before I meet him and when I moved in 3 and half years ago we payed double mortgage and everything to get ahead 1 payed mortgage other put the same to the offset savings. We never changed into joint names for didn’t want to loose the low fixed rate we had which would run out this June and then would change. So now I have no access to any money or anything and they weren’t sure how long the court would hold him so I moved within 48hours and out all in storage and staying on a mattress in a family member’s place for have no money for a bond or anything. And for the account is all in his name can’t afford therapy even though they say 10 free sessions through mental health plan they aren’t free anymore. And to get a lawyer isn’t cheap either and doing all takes along time for legal aid and all also.. I am so lost and all can think of is the amazing life we had planned we renovated our house and we were so happy and now in a blink my whole life is up in smoke and my head is spinning like I am in a movie..

PTSD-227,Life must get better than this!,"Gday, I feel like I need to get this off my chest! I’ve been struggling again for the past 7 months. It has turned me back to substance abuse again to cope/switch off and I’m getting worse. It all started when I broke off the relationship with my partner but still stayed friends and lived together. Little did i realised how much it affected her, I found out eventually that bills weren’t being paid, she also lost her baby sister (stillborn) and still to this day battling with anxiety, Depression and multiple problems with her body after the covid vaccine. I took on the role to look after her and it was very stressful at times. Trips to the hospital and doctors. Juggling a full time job as well (6 days a week) coming home tired and exhausted I still had to maintain the house,cook, clean and play with our 2 beautiful dogs. That was when I started using again it gave me energy to do things around the house that needed to be done. Work was becoming really depressing and a work colleague who I thought was a true friend turned out to be a narcissist and had psychologically abused me to try turn me against my partner ever since I put my focus on her wellbeing. Since I realised for who he truly was I tried to expose him but it seems he’s playing the victim. Pretty much all my work mates are now belittling me and gaslighting me. I feel like they’re trying to set me up to fail. it’s been so frustrating and confusing as I just want the truth as to why ?!?!? Why are you doing this to me ?!? because I have turned to substance abuse I have been missing out on work more and more. If I keep this up I will lose my job.The person who I get used to get the substance from, I know him well and again I thought he was a good enough person but in that 3 month period he must have seen how down I was at times and decided to use me and emotionally abuse me as well, when i confronted him. He somehow managed to turn people against me and made him look like the victim. Great!!! My partner and I have recently decided to rekindle our relationship and give it another try. She is dead set against my substance I use and I am trying to stop! I’d get as much as 5-6 days clean then relapse. I’m at the point where I feel like I’m going to snap and go crazy and use violence because inside I’m soo angry at them for taking advantage of me and I’m angry at myself because I just want to stop!",Freedom14,Community Member,01-02-2024,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/life-must-get-better-than-this/td-p/584090
PTSD-228,TW Healing physical and verbal abuse from childhood,"Possibly distressing content. I have an intellectual understanding of everything that has happened to me in the past. I have also completely forgiven things done to me in childhood and carry no resentment about those things. However, the impacts of early physical and verbal violence remain in my nervous system. I have successfully processed adult traumas somatically with my psychologist, removing the charge from those experiences. But the charges from early childhood remain. The worst physical violence occurred between the ages of 3 and about 7-8. While that later lessened, frequent volatile verbal rage continued to be directed at me. In my experience things like cognitive restructuring have been useless as I've basically done that already and that doesn't shift how my nervous system innately responds. I continue to have fear triggered in daily life by situations that are not necessarily harmful, yet my nervous system will be waiting for the harm to happen. I have practised sitting in meditation in nature for extended periods. As soon as I allow my body to let go I will usually vomit, my body purging the toxic sludge it has been carrying as a lifelong thing. It seems never ending and I am profoundly exhausted. I at least feel held in nature, like it is my witness and it always feels way safer than anything to do with other humans. The people I find I can really truly relate to are very gentle and sensitive people like myself and I usually find they have actually been through similar experiences to myself. I find people who haven't had such experiences will judge how you should manage in life with no understanding of visceral trauma and how it takes over when Complex PTSD responses take hold. The world can feel like a very alienating place of non-understanding, leading me to retract back into self-protection and isolation. With the friends I know with similar experiences, we tend not to go too deep into it, I think out of fear of not wanting to trigger one another (we are all ultra sensitive empaths so tread very carefully with one another). I think I am writing this because I am still in this struggle and maybe wanting to know how others have processed early life verbal and physical attack? There were forms of less direct and more manipulative emotional abuse from my mother as well and this would occur when she would dissociate and split off into aspects of her own trauma, the same pattern of what her mother did to her. So this compounded the more explicit, blatant abuse I experienced. I am writing this out possibly because I minimised these experiences for so many years which was a coping mechanism. Maybe I am now trying to confront it head on. I experience flashbacks regularly, but I've been so dissociated from them I've only recently started to grasp when I am in them, if that makes any sense. Before I was just in them, so that is probably progress that some part of me can step back just enough to see I am in them now. Do others out there relate to purely visceral trauma that comes from earliest life experiences? But please don't go there if it is triggering. I find listening to musicians/songwriters who have been through similar things helps because it is a form of empathy and resonates in the body and emotions which is where I need to heal.",Eagle Ray,Valued Contributor,02-02-2024,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/tw-healing-physical-and-verbal-abuse-from-childhood/td-p/584139

Was treated as the family scapegoat and was blamed for my dads violence even though the rest of the family witnessed it. They tell everyone it was my fault and I was 14 at the time, I tried to run away but parents kept telling everyone I was a problem child and getting the police to find me. I often tried to hide at friends houses or parties. I witnessed horrific abuse towards my siblings from a very young age then it started happening to me when I got older. My siblings weren't the same after the abuse and they became bullies and often ganged up on me. I was the only one who challenged and stood up against my dads abuse. I had eating disorders, teenage drug use, hypersexuality, was coerced into SA from ppl who still try to pretend they are a friend and no one suspects them. Now in my adult years my parents have stolen my money and try to control my finances illegally (not asking for legal advice). There's no guardian orders or anything and they want invoices and receipts otherwise they won't send my money. They use my mental health as an excuse and weaponise my emotions and diagnosis to make me feel like I deserve this treatment and it's okay. I've got many ppl trying to help but my parents either ignore their emails or make up excuses for their behaviour. My parents are the source of all my mental health issues and they have financially trapped me into their care and keeping me in the abuse cycle. Struggling so much and have just been using food for comfort which effects my budget and I'm on DSP. Been trying to get ahead in life with my goals but somehow my parents find a way to sabotage my plans, I feel like they are 10 steps ahead of me and constantly try to put me down. I've struggled with friendships too and ppl have often told me I must be autistic but I think I just seem to be drawn towards other toxic ppl like how my family treat me. Healthy kind people always felt uncomfortable or unsafe. Hope all this makes sense.",Bleu,Community Member,04-02-2024,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/childhood-trauma/td-p/584273
PTSD-230,Please can someone help me,"Hi, I have had a bad life and feel no matter how hard I try I always screw up eventually and no i’m In a spot where once again I have failed. I just don’t know why I can’t improve myself and stay that way. i have had to deal with violence and sexual & attempted sexual abuse growing up and then domestic violence as an adult. While I have managed to get away from those circumstances I keep finding ways to screw up my life. I struggle a lot with weight, keeping on track with finances and now my relationship is failing. I am not enjoying my job and suffer from anxiety a lot but wonder if perhaps I’m falling into depression. It seems to be hard to find a good Counsellor that is available more than once a month. My young son has some health and mental issues that I now also have to deal with. I have now gotten to the stage where I just cry and avoid going to work.

PTSD-231,Cptsd and where it all started,"Cptsd can be a life changer and nothing ever prepares you for when or where your next trigger will hit. My life is a classic example of this horror day after day and there are some days where I wish that there could be assisted dying to rid me of this pain My trauma story starts way back... Childhood in a narcissistic enmeshed abusive a psychotic family... My mother and her parents the primary abusers especially my mother... She would stop at nothing to ruin my life, even if it meant contacting people and partners and turning them against me so she could hopefully in her mind gain sick control over my life. She is an enmeshed undiagnosed BPD personality and has constantly tried to derail my life by either trying to bring me down with her constant negative chatter about her work or other aspects of her life in order to gain sympathy from me. When I moved away from home many years ago her end of the day phone calls were relentless. All negative. This didn't even stop when I was going through chemotherapy for lymphoma. She would call me at the hospital to dump on me. When eventually I told the nurses to field all calls. You get the picture, she is the root of my cptsd. But there are other factors that followed after she and her toxic family laid down the foundations for my trauma. They say we mirror or attract what our environment was and this was true for me until my late thirties. I am 39 now. I had three very abusive partnerships with men who cheated, lied, were physically abusive and financially abusive. After the third I saw a pattern emerging and my realisation was that I was attracting the very personality types that were imprinted on me from my upbringing. I left the third relationship and haven't had another one since. Life after covid... Well it was turned upside down and due to this factor I was forced to live with my abusive mother once again. The triggers are relentless. Anyway that is my story... Thank you for listening.

PTSD-232,Gaslighting: Advice for daughter of mother with PTSD,"Hey everyone. So, I am having relationship difficulties with my mum. This has been ongoing since I was 13 (when my parents decided to separate). I am now 22. My father was physically and emotionally abusive to my mum and I can remember only a handful of times he was emotionally abusive to myself and my sibling (he mostly ignored us when in this violent state but when he did notice us it was terrifying). But he always made me feel very scared. My mum has PTSD and when they separated as the eldest I was expected to help a lot. Fast forward to when I was 20. I've moved out of home because I can't get along with my mum at all. She made me do all the housework (iron all her clothes, laundry, feed pets, clean bedrooms, bathroom, living areas, etc) and cook. All while working and studying. This was not a new thing but occurred during high school as well. My sibling rarely helped. Since moving out, she has threatened to throw my clothes on the front lawn, take money out of my account - she always threatened but never did this, she used to threaten to smash my car, has told me she would jump out of my car if I didn't take her to lunch when I was driving. I have slowly been detaching from her. I have most of my things, removed her from my bank account, and changed my address for everything. However, since Christmas I have not seen her. She calls me on the phone and we fight nonstop or she tries to get me to do things for her. She has even tried demanding I come over and clean the house even though I don't live there. She claims she supports me and I only get good marks because of her, etc. She has also said I should pay her money even though she works full-time and I barely get shifts. We have been arguing on facebook and she has gone and deleted all her messages that make her look bad. Then tells me I am imaging things. For example, she has said that she never asked me for money currently even though I sent her the screenshot of it. She denied it and said she didn't mean that but having read the message multiple times I don't get her point at all. It sounds like she does want money. I had my birthday recently and I refused to see her until she owns responsibility for her actions. She said that my birthday was as much her day as mine because she birthed me, demanded I come over because she decorated and has cake even though I have plans and told her so. I don't know how to fix our relationship. She is the only parent I have left but I don't think I can handle this.",lil8002,Community Member,30-01-2024,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/gaslighting-advice-for-daughter-of-mother-with-ptsd/td-p/584003
PTSD-233,I am severely triggered by sexual things,"A bit of back story / reasons why I believe I get triggered: I was sexually abused as a 5 year old by my own grandfather for several years. I have been cheated on in every relationship I have been in, including my current one. I was severely bullied throughout primary and Highschool. My mum called me a lesbian when I was growing up (even though I’m not) and constantly would put other females down in front of me. My mum was also verbally, physically and emotionally abusive to me my whole life (she has BPD and Bipolar). In my current relationship I still get triggered by my partner watching movies with sex scenes in them, my partner wanting to watch porn, liking females provocative pictures on social media. All of these things are weighing down our relationship and we constantly get into arguments over it. My partner also was emotionally and physically unfaithful earlier in the year in 2023, which has made my insecurities far worse, and my trust even less than it already was. I really don’t want to live my life being insecure anymore, and constantly in fear that my partner is going to betray / hurt me. I’m super sensitive to porn and all of the things I mentioned above, and I don’t want to be this way anymore, or let these things rule my life.",Bee1998,Community Member,04-01-2024,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-am-severely-triggered-by-sexual-things/td-p/581928
PTSD-234,Unjust custody situation,"What would you do? Long story short. Move in with husband and his family. Naive. Didn't know how controlling they were going to get.

Get Post natal depression. Husband's parents kick us out. Husband loses his job xand I couldn't get work. My parents go overseas for months. My parents eventually get back. My in laws use the legal system against me and file for custody of my daughter. Husband begs me back. Many empty promises of getting custody of my daughter back. Move in with him (without in laws) Many empty promises of getting our daughter back. Marriage becomes financially, emotionally and physically abusive. Move back in with my parents and baby.

PTSD-235,Lost. Trying to cope with 4 deaths & my rape trial dropped,"I feel like I’ve reached my limit. Aside from previous trauma, the past few years have really tested my resilience, especially the last 12 months. I’ll try to summarise.My nan died, my friend died from an accident, my mum died after fighting cancer for a few years - caring for mum at the end was the hardest thing I’ve endured, for various reasons - my beloved dog died, I was going through the absolutely awful and traumatic legal process of a rape case, which fortunately finally ended with a trial date set.I came into 2024 though with so much hope, for positive change, and potential happiness.8th Jan, I get told the DPP decided to drop my case, there would be no trial. After all of the immense stress & trauma from the process (that I ended up in hospital for months from when I tried to end my life). Suddenly, it’s over, just like that, the government gave up on me - it was too hard to fight for me in court. 15th Jan I took my other dog to the vet she was having trouble breathing. Immediate X-rays revealed she had collapsed lungs and I’d be best to say goodbye in a matter of days.3 days later take her to my normal vet (yes, yesterday), who says actually it might just be fluid on the lungs caused by an infection- we will try meds for 2 weeks. I should have been ecstatic, but I was so shocked. Of course, it’s fantastic news, she’s my world. But now I feel numb, and totally lost. The intense and devastating emotions over the 2 weeks have I think finally broken me. And my poor doggo is still not well I have to listen to her struggling to breathe all of the time which is heartbreaking and I have no idea what’s going to happen or when. I don’t know what to do with myself, or my feelings, or lack thereof.",Gizmo6,Community Member,19-01-2024,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/lost-trying-to-cope-with-4-deaths-amp-my-rape-trial-dropped/td-p/583178
PTSD-236,PTSD from mum's cancer and brother's betrayal,"I've been experiencing intense panic/rage attacks lately. A few weeks ago I punched a door. I thought this was the end of it. Then again today. I have this anger built up over issues that have occurred in the past few years which I'll describe now.Mum had cancer treatment for several years and in that time my brother, his wife and family stopped associating with mum and I. So I was not only dealing with the situation of mum's illness, but the betrayal. The problem is now that mum is better, I find that I can't talk or listen to certain topics, or else I go into a rage. It just gets too much. Illness, my brother's wife and her treatment of us have both deeply traumatised me. How can I deal with this? I get counselling, but whereas I've tried to compartmentalise it, mum keeps dragging up these uncomfortable feelings.

Because i love with my parents, i like to get some validation and support from my mum, to let her know whats going on for me but i cant even get any understanding or any emotional support because of her hearing disability and limited patience with a sentence or certain words, she comes off as extremely rude to me and gets annoyed at me, doesnt want to know and treats mental illness like something negative and like im selfish to talk about me and my problems. She will make it worse and say certain things that can be quite nasty and old fashioned, makig me seem like im the problem. When all i wanted was a bit of comfort. I come off feeling so much worse than before and it can make the day a crying one again.

I am often in a constant state of flight or fight. When I’m like that my reasonable self disappears and I can become angry or extremely upset. I can do and say things that I wouldn’t in normal circumstances. I then get depressed and sometimes have thoughts of suicide. I feel worthless, unloved, alone and feel I have nothing to look forward to. I withdraw from people and don’t enjoy doing things I normally enjoy. Then after awhile I pick myself up and start to climb out of my hole. I build up my walls again and try to get on with things but the hurt and anxiety is still there just hiding behind my walls. It’s always at this time I tend to have appointments and my “reasonable” self is back. I can tell them how I have been but I never get help. I don’t just want to talk, I want some help.

When I realised the one person that was meant to love and care for me didn't, it hits me so very hard. Not only did she make me worthless, unloved and uncared for, for some reason - realising that all now - makes it so much harder. It's like all the pain she caused me over the years has just come at me full force now. It's not as if I didn't feel it at the time, but I thought I had to win her love (and it's not very often that I was able to do that). I thought working it all out might've been a 'freeing' feeling but it's heavy. Can anyone else share how they coped when the first realised their parent/s were narcissists.

I struggle with feelings of abandonment and not feeling significant enough.This can be so triggering, especially in my marriage and as a Mum of 3.I guess what I want to know is.. when something triggers us, is it healthy for the relationship for us to address the issue, try fix it and set a boundary around how we need to be treated in future? Or do we just do the work on our own reactions to the situation and say nothing? I have so many boundaries I am trying to set after 12 years of not speaking up, but I am met with anger, yelling and zero understanding of where I'm coming from, and am made to feel like I am the problem.This causes me to spiral into a depression and gives me feelings of hopelessness.Thank you for any help you can give.",HopefulMum,Community Member,30-12-2023,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/relationships-and-cptsd/td-p/581394
PTSD-244,Reoccuring PTSD??,"Hi all, In 2015 i was living in a ground floor apartment. This particular night i had taken a sleeping tablet as I had been struggling to sleep at that time. I was woken up at 2am to the balcony glass doors being smashed in my bedroom.A young man had thrown a huge concrete paver through my window and it bounced off my bed. It was lucky i was sleeping on the other side. He came in and was screaming at me. I was screaming back. The event happened in only about 5 minutes but was obviously terrifying. Alot happened and ended with 7 police coming through my bedroom and pinning the guy to the floor. He was on ICE. The police were patrolling and heard my screams (lucky I'm loud).Anyway, i had really bad PTSD for a long time after that. Scared of my own shadow. I thought I had been ok for the past 5 years or so. However, my PTSD has been triggered. There have been a few murders around my local area recently. There's also a guy at work who i find terrifying. He has a stalkerish vibe. He would constantly message me after hours and stares at me alot. It freaks me out. All of this has really triggered me. I freak out walking through the basement of my unit block to go to my car.I didn't order Uber eats the other night knowing I'd have to go downstairs in the dark to meet the driver. I don't like to walk to and from places alone.Any tips on how to heal from this would be greatly appreciated.Kate",Keeeks84,Community Member,24-04-2023,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/reoccuring-ptsd/td-p/564110
PTSD-245,Help please,"I am really sorry to bother you I know people need this more than I do but I was wondering if I could have some help please. I’m so tired. I have bipolar, PTSD, chronic adjustment disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety, social anxiety, mild Tourette’s, recent trauma & autism. I find studying relaxing & I like nothing better than being on my own. I work full time & have my own routines and rituals that help me feel better. I was raised by an extremely abusive mother (physically & emotionally) as well as a dad I adored. My grandmother and I were really close and my mother hated this so I was belted after each visit for one reason or another. She was very open with how much she didn’t like me & that I was odd. She would repeat phrases telling me people didn’t like me. . By the time I was 12 I had anorexia. I completed 2 university degrees & was married at 25. Had my beautiful son at 26. This is when the abuse started & I did everything I could to make sure I protected my son from it. My life was threatened repeatedly & he had a knife stuck in a post just outside the back door to remind me of what would happen if I disobeyed him. He finally left me for someone else so I was able to escape the marriage. There was then 9 years in court to try and stop my son going. He had already told me he didn’t want our son as he wasn’t a girl but continued with court. My son hated his father because of the abuse. 6 years after this marriage ended I met someone else who was the physical opposite of my 1st husband. He was also an abusive alcoholic who had 3 teenage children who would steal from me, take drugs and trash the house. . These behaviours ignored by their father and left for me to deal with - even looking for ice addict when they ran away (many times). I financially not only lost everything but was over $60000 in debt when he left me for someone else. growing up we saw mum threaten dad with a knife on 2 occasions. She would threaten to kill us many times. Through my marriage my mother refused to speak to me because I had disobeyed her & got married. Last year my dad died. I moved in with her to help her. My companion dog was run over and killed in her yard. I have a new dog, am terrified of losing her.. My nephew lives here. He lies, won’t help and won’t pay board.

My question to any victim of sexual abuse or mum of a child who has been abused.....Why does she hate me? Im not stupid...ofcourse the dropping her off to the sicko when she obviously had been hurt by him confused her little mind....but i was only doing what the COURTS demanded. I hate courts. they fail our innocent children. I try everyday to text her....tell her how much i love her and miss her....she gives one word replies days later.. when she does visit she is angry all the time with me...this behaviour happened about a year before she left. and if anyone is wondering, no, i do not bring the abuse up. When it happened i told myself he has taken her body, but not her soul. i thought that would be enough to get us through this....but it wasnt. Im so sad. But that i can try to deal with.

PTSD-248,Is this Gaslighting,"I was involved in industry reform of a specific industry that was very very politically volatile. The process required me to go through a role change which included a mental change from a unionist oriented role to a role that was more in tune with corporate ideology. I carried some of the union values across the line into corporate psychological territory. Some people were very unhappy about my outlook and decided to force me through a process of ideology reshaping, or aligning my mind to their ideology. Some of the tactics used to destabilise me included the use of electronic monitoring techniques. 1 example of one of the tactics is as follows:- I purchased a new Honda line trimmer and then the next day I had a call from a telesales operator, who was trying to sell new tiled roofs. The fellow prattled for minutes then I went to end the call and then the fellow thanked me for my time and said he had to go anyway because he was going to buy a new Honda line trimmer, which of course is exactly what I had done the day before. Another example is after making calls about oversees holiday to a specific destination, and 2 females joined the queue behind me and raised and projected their voices toward me and started saying things that had a high degree of familiaritie to the calls I had made about the holiday. These types of situations are only a couple of a range of tactics that are used. I have used the expression of phone tapping and also covert psychological destabilisation. I have recently heard of a situation called gaslighting.

Ive been on beyond blue for a while now and had a few different threads but haven't shared much of my story, or the reasons why I have developed DID. Be mindful this post mentions different types of abuse. On the outside my childhood looked normal. I had a mum, a dad, a brother, and some extended family. And although we weren't well off, my parents still owned their home and we had food on the table.But behind closed things were falling apart. It starts at just 5. My dad was diagnosed with a serious brain tumour. It mainly effected his emotions and his body's ability to regulate itself. He was very sick, spent over 6 months in treatment. The drs got rid of his tumour but he was never the same, with serious brain damage and vision impaired. My mum became physically abusive not being able manage, or lock us up for days. I don't know what was worse. At 5 I also had a big operation in my abdomen and with things going on at home began my struggle with eating and thus I later developed an eating disorder but that is only a side note. In the years following I had issues with my grandfather, he was always touchy but I vague memories of this slowly getting worse. Then at 8-9 I was the product of incest. My brother would touch me, but in the later period this left to much more and rape. The next year my family moved states and I got away from grandfather and my brothers abuse stopped. I would withdraw into fantasy and began to dissociate a lot. Then High School came around and was difficult with very few friends and bullying and avoidance. My mum had an affair when I was 13 and then left my dad. Forcing me and my brother to live week with her week with dad. It was very destabilizing. Later on in school I became increasingly withdrawn, and began to self harm. My weight at this point was getting very low. By the end of high school my weight was critical and I made my first attempt. Ive spent the next 11 years in and out of hospital, institutions, in various therapies, seen so many different professionals, struggling to come to the conclusion that I am not not what has happened to me",Centaured,Community Member,26-08-2022,PTSD and trauma,262,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/centaureds-story-tw/td-p/545085
PTSD-250,Struggling with workplace SA on top of everything else,"Hey all, so I had been going through life with C-PTSD, but a workplace incident about 5 years ago - nothing physical happened, but the idea of a man much much bigger than me saying he was going to get me drunk and you can guess the rest, in front of everyone on the site - just keeps coming back to me. I've apparently left it too late for workers comp or whatever, the law firm I spoke to didn't really offer any other suggestions past that. in a bit of a meltdown at the moment, I also had a pretty bad episode when I saw a photo of the then opposition leader (now PM) at the town airport where this worksite was. basically quit that job immediately, was on a decent packet too. struggled through working at a school again for a year and basically been out of a significant income since then. really feeling backed into a corner and no way of getting out",hawaiian_robot,Community Member,13-12-2023,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-with-workplace-sa-on-top-of-everything-else/td-p/580233
PTSD-251,"This will rip you apart, and who knows what it will leave afterwards","I read something today, it said ""This will rip you apart, and who knows what will be left afterwards."" I use to love remembering and reading quotes, they would help me express my words in ways I couldn't put together. My inner turmoil often resembles a high-speed train derailing at neck-brakeing speeds, causing chaos and fear. However, as I find myself sinking to unfamiliar depths, I no longer recognize the person staring back at me. It's disorienting because I no longer care, which is unusual for me. In the past, I would have taken action, seeking solace in reading, writing, and engaging in activities that nourish my soul.. As I gaze into my own eyes, a sense of disorientation washes over me, unlike anything I've experienced before. The weight of being lost engulfs me, but this time it's different as I'm screaming inside to find myself. Today, I stumbled upon a quote that pierced through my soul, awakening me to a harsh reality. Its words hiss at me, warning that they will tear me apart, leaving behind an uncertain aftermath. These words refuse to fade away, unlike the rest of the thoughts that have plagued me this year. I find myself questioning why they resonate with me so deeply, why they refuse to release their grip on my mind. I'm constantly disconnected from reality, engaged in a daily struggle to comprehend my triggers and navigate through relentless mood swings. It's become clear that I've been tearing myself apart since the very moment I began to focus on myself, a journey that I never truly started.",Blackberry_rose,Community Member,08-12-2023,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/this-will-rip-you-apart-and-who-knows-what-it-will-leave/td-p/579885
PTSD-252,Chronic trauma and struggling,"I've been in therapy since I was 15 dealing with domestic violence/infidelity/abuse between and from parents (who I'd just characterize as extremely self-absorbed and immature people). I've felt cagey around people since I was 13 and was first majorly depressed when I was 15. Despite all that I was lucky enough to get into medical school.This was the first year that I was finally living apart from them and what was meant to be a great year really did not unfold that way. I got into my first relationship and was sexually assaulted and just treated not well. Despite that, I was alienated from a bunch of people who are better friends with my ex-partner (who tbh didn't know what happened). I wasn't looking after myself and got progressively more and more depressed and resorted to overworking myself. Going to hospital and placements and getting exposed to stories of horrific DV and abuse, the failings of the health system and people suffering as a consequence, just made my mental health progressively worse. At the beginning of year, I was although, an insecure person and still haunted a bit by my past, I still believed in myself, and believed in my future, but now it's all gone away. Despite studying pathologically hard, I sat my exams last week and (although a difficult exam for all) am honestly not sure if I passed and just feel even more like a failure. I don't think I should be doing medical school in this mindset. It's just very hard to put in the steps to help myself when I feel so broken and unworthy. I look back on my life and it just makes me feel sad and I don't want things to be like this anymore.",RuneCat17464,Community Member,22-11-2023,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/chronic-trauma-and-struggling/td-p/578932

It has undermined my trust with my parents and siblings, the love I had for them. It now haunts me to this day and I have nowhere to talk about it. Being the 2nd child I also noticed my mum always treated me differently from my siblings where she clearly didn’t love me which also hurts me to this day.

PTSD-254,Trauma from scam - how do I move on?,"TL; DR: the scammers impersonated the police over the phone but had uniforms and badges, tried to arrest me for crimes I didn’t commit, and got me to transfer them my savings because they needed my assets frozen, threatened to harm my brother and partner if I didn’t do as they said. I live in Australia and am a dual citizen. I have a good job and earn decent money. I’m well educated and got promoted to a 3-5 year of experience position after 1.5 year of working. So I was very proud of myself. I felt like that was a pitfall and I am now being punish for my hubris. Fast forward to the end of 2.5 hours of interrogation with the scammers impersonating police from my birth country, with uniforms and badges, playing good cop bad cop, they managed to get me to send my joint saving with my partner over the last year ($10k) to an account with a state owned bank in my birth country, because they needed to freeze my assets during the investigation. Over the next few days, there was a lot of manipulation and psychological harassments from these scammers ie keeping me on the phone over meal time, yelling, pointing out sounds in the background, making warnings about my safety and my brother and partner’s safety, etc. A couple of days like that, and I eventually mustered up the courage to call my lawyer just to be told that I was being scammed and should go to the police.Now, I’ve reported this to the Australian police, banks, etc. The scammers didn’t stop. They bombarded my phone with messages and calls from all messaging apps. I had to change my number as a result. My partner and I made decent money but we had student debt, credit card debt and living expenses is a nightmare in the city. It took us years pinching pennies to save up that much. I couldn’t tell my parents how much money I lost because when I tried, when I had the word “scam” out of my mouth, my mom told me I was silly and gullible.I could not shake off the shame. I was not aware a scam could be this elaborate.I’m depressed and on the verge of crying all the time. During the first day when this happened, I wished it was a scam so that the whole thing would stop. Now it stopped and I can’t stop beating myself up.

PTSD-257,"Emotions following MVA, MBA or other Trauma.","Hey Everyone, This is my first post to any forum on this topic. Okay so a brief background....I had a big motorbike accident in 2015 which put me in a coma for 2 weeks, multiple admissions totaling 8 months, 18+ injuries and 12+ surgeries. After i woke from my coma my family were always there. No that is not an exaggeration....my mum was there everyday which at times was nice but most of the time i was just holding everything together because i didn't want my family to see me break i guess. to this day i haven't really dealt with my emotions or feelings, i did see a psychologist in hospital where i opened up, i was on heavy meds so i had NO filter and she said ""okay ill pop back tomorrow"" and i never saw her again so i guess in a way i began or started to deal with it but that stopped. i have held it together since with a few slip ups though (anger) i spoke to my GP and he at first was just chatting with me because i just wanted to chat, then he said i should start seeing a psychologist so i did, i saw this psychologist when i could afford it, which for the first couple months was every week but then got further and further in between. i was feeling GREAT talking with him and he was helping me. i stopped seeing him because it got expensive and thought i had a lid on things but as of late its like that lid is coming undone. now i know you're probably thinking ""simple fix....got back to the psychologist"" but i wanted to see if there was anyone else out there like me. so my question is...is there anyone else with a similar backstory/situation and has ever increasing anger and irritability? please forgive the lack of capital letters.",xXJIGSAWXx,Community Member,25-07-2018,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/emotions-following-mva-mba-or-other-trauma/td-p/381226
PTSD-258,Relationship after Domestic Abuse,"Hi, I'm 26 years old and this is a little back story. A week after my 18th my mum was diagnosed with cancer. I took over family duties and very rarely went out. I was drugged and raped at a party with friends (still 18). I suppressed alot of what I was feeling to get on with looking after my family. At 19, I fell for the first man that made me feel safe. Around 6 months in I moved out with him and the abuse started - physical, verbal, emotional, mental, and financial (I was the bread winner, caused debt etc). He isolated me from family, cheated and took everything. I was stuck for almost 6 years and feared for my life. Fast forward to now. I have the most beautiful long distance partner. He is so great with communication but I feel myself struggling to let him into the deeper parts of my trauma.

PTSD-262,How do I stop my trauma ruining me?,"5 years ago I lost my Dad at 35. Three months later my partner left our family and removed us from our property.Everything in my life changed.I started again, from a refuge with 4 children to a home of our own. I have worked fulltime since then Also.My heart was in pieces.From the day I lost my dad, I started drinking heavily. It turns out that I'm a highly functioning alcoholic. Our mornings begin around 5.30am, work, school, preschool, sports, play dates etc. Once we were all home I would start drinking while making dinner. I could barely make it to bedtime before literally passing drunk. I've moved around alot and after the last move, promised my eldest that we would stay put til he had finished his schooling.I've just signed a lease for the 2nd year, now I'm wanting to run away. Why is this?I've changed careers also from chef to office, so I can be home at night with the kids. It's since this change that I have been more aware of my alcohol intake. I have tried cutting down, I only have one glass of wine while cooking dinner at night these days. But once dinners done, I sit in front of the TV and wait for 8.30 so I can go to bed.My kids have been raised by their devices for the past 5 years and I'm noticing this now because I'm home at nights and they're all off in their rooms. I'm lonely.I'm realising this past month that I am not the person I used to be.Nor do I like the person I have become.I don't do anything except work, run a household and clean.I'm not the involved parent that I once was. There are so many times where my head is stuck in my phone and I completely ignore what my kids are saying until they yell at me for a response.I have no hobbies. I have isolated myself from all of my friends.I do the bare minimum with my house ( my washing pile is the size of a small car). And I am so wasteful with money that I'm always broke ( I used to be great with money).I gamble when I'm down, I shop when I'm down, I smoke pot sometimes and drink sometimes. Occasionally, when I need to clean my house, I'll use a point of ice to get through it.I believe this all started when my Dad and ex partner exited my life.5 years on, I know the traumas in there, but how do I bring it to the surface and deal with it? I'm not much of a crier, I hate feeling weak which is exactly how crying makes me feel.I want so badly to be someone my children want to be around again.I don't have a life that would afford me rehab, Im a singke Mum with 4 children and no one to take them for an extended period of time. I have thought about going to detox, kind of like a reset.That and ongoing counselling support would definitely help.But what can I do in the meantime?I would love to find someone to talk to on here, tell me I'm not alone.",Dukeyberry,Community Member,16-10-2023,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-do-i-stop-my-trauma-ruining-me/td-p/576636
PTSD-263,Having a difficult time - male with intense panic and fear surrounding dating/intimacy,"Hi everyoneI spent 5 1/2 years in a bad relationship. To cut a long story short, it involved a lot of psychological abuse and so many aspects of my life were under the control of my ex. The most damaging aspect of this time was that I was forced to have sex even though I didn't want to; however when at times my body wouldn't respond (seems normal to not find an abuser attractive in retrospect), I was yelled/screamed at. It was honestly like world war three. I didn't know how to deal with all this back then and I stayed with her honestly believing any issues with intimacy, or the relationship in general were my fault. I left her just over 2 years ago and have been single in that time. Initially once the trauma-bond started to ease, I felt a sense of peace that I enjoyed. Now days I do deal with intense loneliness and in some ways want some kind of deeper connection with someone. Last week a close friend of mine (female) sent me a message that gently hinted she took a romantic interest in me. We've been good friends for a while now. Instead of feeling flattered or feeling good about this, I plunged into an intense panic episode that's lasted most of last week, it's been totally debilitating. I'm terrified of any form of intimacy, especially anything physical, to the point where I feel physically nauseous... this was all caused by one very innocuous message . I don't know even if I am attracted to my friend in that way, I can't even think that clearly with all this fear and panic. I replied to this message, in a friendly way but didn't really encourage that direction of conversation, and we did catch up yesterday , with others, and things seemed a little awkward at first but were better as the afternoon went on. I feel sick with guilt, worried I've hurt her... also absolutely sick of this intense panic and fear. I want to be able to accept compliments from females, and ones I'm attracted to, and even eventually date again... but instead I freeze and invariably push people away.I feel so utterly alone and hopeless at the moment, I never chose to be abused and I'd sure never choose to live like this. I'm hoping others on the forum might be able to empathise and/or offer me some advice?

PTSD-265,Feel nothing about trauma,"Hi all,I have been diagnosed last week with adhd and ptsd.trauma was two seperate sexual assaults by different unrelated people in my 20s both at night in my bedroom from breaking and entering circumstances. I now have a bit of agoraphobia linked with night time and general anxiety that comes and goes in certain situations. Can’t really travel (sleep away fromhome) now without sense of doom, that I could never figure out the reason until recently when these memories started coming back to me. So off I went to my GP and now a diagnosis. I didn’t get to really ask any questions yet in my session as it was a diagnostic session. I had some questions about why I’ve never felt anything about this before. It’s strangely like I’d forgotten it. Not completely but like it wasn’t part of me like I’d read it in the paper, I truely wouldn’t have said it affected me as i don’t have any emotion at all attached to it. I have suffered from panic, disassociation episodes, trouble briefly with intimacy with my husband when I just start crying for no reason during sex and I could never explain any of these things to him or myself. Just thought hormones. It always felt like my body was be anxious and my mind had no idea why. All these general mental health problems did happen after these incidents, when I think about it now. I used to be a pretty chilled, glass half full kid with inattentive adhd issues and the general kid fears, were really the only things before that is it normal not to really have any recollection/feelings toward traumatic events? To feel completely removed but still suffer in the physical bodily type way with a reaction?I’m sort of in a bit of shock when I think about the level of affect it may have had on my life from mid 20s on.

PTSD-267,Am I abusive or being abused?,"My partner and I had an argument that ended the same way it always does, he shuts it down, everything is my fault and that I have communication issues. He can be very mean, swearing at me, criticizing me. He often calls me ""childish"" and repeatedly told me I was acting like a 2-year old during an argument the other night. He locked me out of the house recently while angry and this dragged on for about 4-days, after I told him I am embarrassed by his drinking habits. He made a ""joke"" about flirting with someone else girlfriend, and said that I should trust him to do that and so actually act on it. That's just a few examples. Tonight, I had approached him about how often we had been fighting and bickering. I told him how badly it is starting to affect me. I told him that if every argument continues to be shut down, nasty and unresolved, then resentment is going to continue to build and it's not sustainable. He responded ""sounds like you're blaming it all on me."" I said that I am not blaming him, and he said ""well, you are."" He then started talking about how I had bought a swing set for my daughter for Christmas without talking to him, and went on and on about how it's not okay, behaving as if I had done something super extreme. I became extremely frustrated, because he wouldn't tell me why it bothers him asking why I didn't talk to him. I apologised and said that I was really excited and stuff. And he was saying that's just a ""cop out."" I said ""why are you treating me as if I have committed an unforgivable act, or breaking something very precious to you. I don't understand."" I'm not sure why I said that, but I was very frustrated. He then FINALLY told me why the swing set was bothering him. It's because he doesn't want to move it when he mows the lawn. I said: ""so she misses out on years of fun, because you don't want to move it when you mow the lawn?"" It just escalated from there. He tried to shut down the conversation over and over saying ""I'm done. I'm not talking to you."" Eventually he stated he won't be attending a Family event we're supposed to go to tomorrow and that I have to get a refund on the swingset because he won't have it here. He continued on with how poor my communication is and essentially all the problems I have. I ""just don't stop"".

I have had bits and pieces of memories coming back though.

My mother is quite disturbed, has a lot of trauma herself and was extremely dysregulated my entire upbringing - and still is to this day. She was very emotionally and psychologically abusive towards me. But this isn't the story that one hears as often and it's so hard to find information online. We're so used to hearing about the male abuser - I wanted to post to see if others had any stories of female abusers generally, and also sexual abuse from mothers - maybe female teachers or relatives too...

I’ve had to have physiotherapy. I’m struggling to even label this as sexual assault and I work in family violence. I feel like I should have known better and continue to minimise the situation. I am getting support but feel unstable emotionally due to the ups and downs. When I feel happy or forget about the assault I ask myself why would I feel happy after being assaulted. Working in family violence is a huge distraction focusing on other people, however I’m worried it’s making things worse for me. I haven’t had any time off and caught myself saying today I wish I would get sick and land in hospital so I can have a break. Knowing this is me wanting to escape.

PTSD-270,My story,So I went from Vic to WA to look after my brothers kids. He’s studying nursing and had a placement which fell over the week he had them. I only had 2 weeks of annual leave owing so I took it then (I work in neonatal intensive care) and he got then back on the wed-sun of the second week. My son is 28 and when I was a mum I was pretty strict knowing I was a single mum. These kids don’t get to see my brother ALOT so when they do he likes to make it the most fun time. I respected this until the last day of my 2 weeks. I ordered cakes that thought everyone’s personality including my parents at home (I was leaving in 3 hours) My brother was upset bc the 6 year old didn’t get the cake he wanted. He ate his cake then decided he wanted his 8 yr old brothers cake. My brother saw red and got so upset I didn’t get the same one for him. He bought out my parents and sons cake that was in the fridge and offered it to the 6 year old. I begged him to please not but he gave my parents (in Melb) cake to him and he ate it. I said (after 2 weeks of keeping my mouth shut) this is why your kids behave like they do! My brother pulled me by my hair and threatened to physically assault me. My son got out of the spa and intervened and kept him off me but he said I wasted $600 on getting you here and don’t you ever speak to me or my kids again. I transferred the $600 into his account that minute and my son took me to the airport and I caught the closest plane. He’s tried to call me since but I have nothing to say. My son and parents want to pretend it never happened Im especially traumatised bc was raped 15 mths ago and they are all aware of that Several times my brother has used unacceptable language around that traumatic incident.

PTSD-271,Constantly feel like a character,"Whenever smth would happen in my life, I would catch myself acting like I'm in a story. I feel like I'm constantly acting. I don't know who I am and how I really feel about things. I recently got diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. And I'm afraid I'm going to make this my whole ""life story"" instead of just living life like everyone else. I'm afraid itll become my whole personality and I'll just self sabtoage for this story my brain is making up. I tend to self sabotage when things go well because I think I'm supposed to live a sad life because that's the story I made in my head. Why can I not just be happy and get better without feeling like smth is off? I cant imagine myself getting better. I just see myself suffering and trying to get better, but will always be sad. Like I live in those sad stories where I'm destined to be unhappy and everyone feels bad. It sounds so childish and attention seeking but i can't stop. My anxiety and depression I know are real. They are smth I can't control and they are the only time I actually know what's happening with me. But when I'm feeling okay, I don't know who I am, or what I like, what I want to do or how to just exist.

PTSD-273,i don't have a feeling of safety - complex ptsd and dissociation,"**slight trigger warning - I mention the word abuse** Hello out there, I have been posting on other discussion threads but I haven't created my own post until now.... I am realising lately that I can't feel a sense of safety in my body. I can recall times when I have felt safe, for example lying under my weighted blanket, or cuddling with my partner. But, I can't FEEL the safety in my body when I think about those memories. It is as if my body simply does not retain a memory of that felt experience. However, I can feel terror, rage, helplessness, numbness, intense shame etc when I remember awful things from my past and I very much feel it in my body. I can feel good stuff in the moment as a vague sensation, but I can't retain the memory of it in my body. Does that make sense? I am learning more and more about dissociation at the moment, and I'm realising that I have experienced chronic dissociation (disconnection from my body sensations) to varying degrees since a child. I was never taught as a child what it meant to feel safe and held and nurtured. My childhood was chaotic, dysfunctional and very abusive, physically & emotionally. Thus, the diagnosis of complex PTSD. I am now in my late 40s and the impact of that early trauma is becoming more and more apparent. I realised this when I called the suicide call back service a few weeks ago and the lady kept saying to imagine a time when I felt safe, or to do something that made me feel safe and to keep doing that until I felt safe in my body. I drew a blank - she might as well have been speaking a different language!! It was a revelation to me! I thought that safety was something you created externally, such as, interacting with people you trust, places that feel comfortable in, and activities that feel nice and not too stressful. I never knew that safety was something you could feel INSIDE your body!! I am slowly learning....... I would love to hear from others with a similar experience. But, also from those who can describe what safety feels like.

I am 19, an international student and I arrived here 4 months ago. I came here alone, I left my most of my family back in my country. For the last two months, I noticed that I have been distressed and feel unsatisfied with my ability in speaking and listening. I used to work as an front of house staff at a restaurant for the last two months and In work, I was socially secluded by my coworkers and got always picked up by my boss. I was the only Asian working there. I found sometimes that they have been giving me responsibilities and work they don't want to take care of and mocking me behind my back which was only a side note. Every time my shift ended, my boss called and told me that I was not good enough to do this job and only after that did he let me go home. After working there for one month, I became so discouraged to the point that I feel reluctant to speak and deal with the customer. I lost my commitment and dedication to working there as well as my studies. I have developed a mindset of not being good enough to do or achieve anything and I feel that there is something important skill or necessary capacity lacking in me to be able to work effectively. This anxiety and stress become worse day by day. I also became less engaged in my uni lectures and my friends conversation. I lost my strong concentration in studying and i now tend to procrastinate a lot.

PTSD-280,Delayed grief,"I thought I had got over my father's death which occurred almost 7 years ago.

The next day I've been in a state of panic almost all day. I think it's because we had so many good memories at this particular pub and the realisation now is that those memories were largely because dad was either in our company, or alive at the time (mum and I used to go there during his chemo because he couldn't taste anything). Has anyone else experienced this? Is it something that passes? I think we'll avoid this pub from now on because my heart keeps telling me that dad should be there, but my brain knows he's not.

As part of journaling I typed up a timeline showing yr of event, my age at the time and brief summary of event. First 2 sessions with psychologist were complete taken up by going through the timeline and her asking questions. 3rd session I was already upset, couple days prior had been told by one of my friends herself and her hubby moving interstate before end of the year. This information triggered my fears of abandonment with horrible nightmares of me being completely on my own. Psychologist spent 3rd session trying to calm me down and talked about theory of how trauma affects the brain plus talked about flight, fright, freeze reactions.local dr at recent appointment has doubled my dosage of anti depressants and said he thinks I will be better off being referred to a psychiatrist due to my PTSD. When I asked local gp why he thinking about referring me to different therapist after such short period of time his reply was for me to discuss with my psychologist at next session, discuss with her and then have next review with local gp within a week of having next session with psychologist. Im confused. I don’t understand why about 7 weeks ago local dr referred me to psychologist and after having only seen psychologist for 3 sessions local dr now thinking psychiatrist is more appropriate. has anyone experienced similar?

PTSD-284,Disengaging from toxic mother and siblings,"Hello. I grew up in a household with two extremely narcissistic parents. On top of that my father was very verbally abusive, intimidating and would constantly put me down in front of others. He continued this behaviour towards me until he died 5 years ago. I have no feelings towards him anymore so don't grieve his death or wish he was alive so I could confront him. My mother is elderly with early dementia and the wreckage that she allowed under her watch is something I can't forgive. She was absent when I was growing up - always off doing something for her work, her social life and her status. She was also emotionally absent. She raised a bully of a son - my brother - who bullied me into adulthood and sexually abused me as a child. When I told my mother about the abuse when I was in my 20s she said ""worse things have happened to people."" My sister, like my mother is a narcissistic and extremely superficial. She wants my brother's approval constantly so will support him in any dispute. A year after my father's death the trauma of my childhood and the ongoing bullying and degrading behaviour of my brother just came to the fore. I lost it and confronted each of the family members. Since then (4 years ago) we have barely spoken and despite therapy I don't feel I have moved on. I have been demonised by my brother, sister, their partners and their kids and have no contact wth them apart from occasional emails (which are extremely triggering) about my mother's care. I also loathe my mother but because I was constantly made to feel by my father and then my siblings that I was the cause of all the family fights and that ""I would kill my mother"" I am in a constant state of guilt when I don't see her. When I do see her I have a simmering rage. I would love to know how I can disengage from my family of origin. I have constant suicidal thoughts because of them. They will never reach out to me in any way or show any remorse and I just want to have nothing to do with them. But cutting them out completely is so hard.

PTSD-285,TW DV and SA,"TW DV and SA Hey everyone. I think I just need somewhere to vent a little bit. I am a chef, qualified in march. Earlier in my apprenticeship though I worked with a chef who I thought was really great. I worked for a big company so sometimes it was hard to get that one on one learning. But he really took the time too teach me and show me a lot of really cool things. I really enjoyed working with him,he was a bit rough around the edges but working with him I really felt like I had found a mentor. He left the place I work for almost a year ago now. And I have just found out that he has been arrested and charged for Domestic violence against his wife. I feel shattered and angry. I come from a back ground of family violence and sexual assault and I am always SO vigilant about seeing the sighns. Even my partner says I'm too harsh on people because the second I get a funny feeling I won't go near that person. And there were sighns. He would be late from work because he had to take his wife to the hospital. Or he would have rage fits that were really unnecessary and uncalled for. Being a chef though, it's really common (not right! But common) for people to get angry. So I just filed it under that i guess. One particular instance was one night I had to run the kitchen because he couldn't make it to work at the last minute. And the next day he said it was because him and his wife went out with friends and she had a bit too much to drink and slipped on the road side and split her eye open, he had to take her to the hospital and he even said that the doctors had pulled her aside to ask if it was DV. He said he understood though but he'd never do that. I feel so blind sided. Again. I feel like I should have seen something. Not that it's my responsibility or anything. But just once again I fell for someone being kind to me and they turned out to be someone completely different Too top it off my dad messaged me this week for the first time in about 5 years. I don't talk to my dad. He was one of my abusers. I just feel so anxious lately. And I know all of this contributing to it.

I struggled with PTSD for years and felt like i could never overcome it. i felt so angry everyday as i couldnt redirect my anger to my abuser and hold them accountable. i felt confused with all the anger i had and felt like i didnt have any place to channel it from. as a result, i lashed out over small things to the people i cared about and shut myself entirely from everyone and everything. i saw a therapist weekly but still couldnt control my anger. i didnt want to be consumed with anger and tried to find ways to channel it. i found boxing to be particularly helpful as it was a safe way to demonstrate my anger in a controlled environment. i also become a part of the community which helped me stay connected with people even if i didnt want to. still, i felt like i needed to express my anger to the right target. so, i began writing ""letters"" to my abuser and dumping all of my anger and hatred towards a paper. i know that there will still be anger as PTSD is very complex and enduring in its nature. however, these things really helped me along the way and have continued to help me today. i hope that this is useful for anyone reading it. i am also sorry that we have to go through this and will always continue to be unfair. i wish the best of luck to everyone and i hope that we can all find peace in ourselves one day.",sashamentalhealth,Community Member,17-07-2023,PTSD and trauma,9,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/dealing-with-anger/td-p/570433
PTSD-293,C-PTSD and fear of people,"Warning: possibly trauma activating content. I have made significant improvements in complex trauma symptoms in the past year. One of my biggest fears is that people are going to harm me which is ever-present but had lessened a lot. Then on Monday I got triggered by something that is probably not harmful but activated terror in me. It’s too much to explain the context here. Do others have this extreme fear of people and if so is there something that you’ve found helps you? To me it is experienced as life threatening terror. I can feel my body literally recoil from any contact with humans. Animals are safe to me but not humans. I have experienced a lot of trauma throughout my life. Over the past week I’ve had unrelenting anxiety which yesterday also became depression which I know is a result of the anxiety not resolving. I want to run away from all people and go somewhere remote in nature. I’m also dealing with bouts of cognitive confusion linked to an autoimmune condition I have which isn’t helping. I know self-isolation is not a good or healthy long term strategy. However, I want total isolation from people right now. It is the only way I can feel safe. It can feel like this is the only way I can be safe in life, to avoid people as much as possible, even though there is part of me that loves people and wants connection. But right now connection feels profoundly dangerous. I am back in the centre of my childhood terror. Right now the Bruce Springsteen song Brothers Under the Bridge is speaking to me in which a Vietnam veteran tries to explain his need for isolation to his daughter. I think my grandfather was like this in how he isolated from others following traumatic war experiences.

PTSD-294,Heartbroken and Confused,"My long term bf of 7yrs lied to me about wanting to get married and have kids. Keep in mind that we had already picked baby names we liked and he also gave me a wedding planner journal. Relationship wise I thought everything was pretty good. The only thing we would debate about is when we were going to move in together. I had a miscarriage last December (I didn’t know I was pregnant at the time). I found myself falling into depression hole. Whenever I would tell him how I was feeling he would just brush off my feelings. After a weekend away with his friends, he told me that he “does not know” if he wants to be in a relationship with me anymore. Heartbroken, I decided to break up with him. It’s been 5 mths now and he has reached out and says he wants to talk to me. During the no contact phase he kept calling and sending me texts. I didn’t respond to any of them. I needed space to heal. In the texts he told me he loved me but felt he was growing apart. I’m very hesitant to see him in person as I believe he is not going to tell me anything that I don’t already know. Is he just trying to make himself feel better about the break up? I feel as though I’m just going to get hurt again. The emotional pain is unbearable. Grieving the future I had imagined with him and trying to accept that it is no longer, is really hard for me. Some days are good and some days I’m really bad mentally.Looking back on the relationship I have realised that I was the only one making compromises and it was only when I decided to stand my ground (regarding marriage and children) that my ex had an issue with me.There was a lot of emotional abuse and found myself always getting pushed to my limits before yelling and finding myself in an argument with him (reactive abuse). Are there any tips or advice you guys can give me in order to move on? I feel like nothing I have read is helping…Do you think I should meet up with him? Or should I go with my gut feeling and not meet up? I feel like I’m unable to trust his words after he lied to me for so long…",Charisma_Lotus,Community Member,11-08-2023,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/heartbroken-and-confused/td-p/572211
PTSD-295,Engulfing Narc Mother,"I'm an only child, and my mother has always made sure I was provided for and neglect and what I thought was love was never an issue, but if my attention is off her, or if I have a different opinion, or I don't drop everything and go to her at a moments notice, she calls me names and tells me I'm no daughter. She's tried to come between my partner and I and even my son and I. She's also saying that her ex is stalking her because of the traffic noise outside, and saying that helicopters are landing on her roof because the police are checking on her. When she goes too far and does something really cruel, she'll go out and buy me stuff I don't need as an implied apology, but then becomes passive aggressive. She's never actually been diagnosed with npd but I suspect she's the engulfing type as she calls me ten or more times a day and has to be in control, right down to calling me and telling me what to eat or watch on TV. I'm at her place right now at 3.40 in the morning because she demanded I come over. She does this whenever things are going well for me and it's getting worse every year. I'm fifty one years old and I feel like a child. I've gone no contact twice before but have broken it when she's faked a heart attack (the doctors at hospital spent 14 and 12 hours testing her and couldn't find anything. Soon as they told her she was OK she was up and smiling.). Sorry for the ramble but I don't know what to do. I can't put her in a home because she has long periods of lucidity a d besides I'd be riddled with guilt.",Madmel72,Community Member,17-07-2023,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/engulfing-narc-mother/td-p/570415
PTSD-296,"Repressed memories, sexual assault and confusion","When I was 18, a man 20 years older than me coerced me into a relationship. He was a family friend and I worked for him. I told myself it was what I wanted, that I said yes, that it was my choice, my responsibility. I told myself that it wasn’t that bad because he never hit me. I told myself that even if it was bad, I deserved it because I was a terrible person/partner/mother. I felt no attachment to my child but I took her and left anyway because nothing changed and I couldn’t take the constant barrage of lectures, insults, questioning, interrogating, accusations, gaslighting. I felt crazy. I left and told myself it wasn’t bad and that it didn’t affect me at all. Well, nobody would be surprised to hear it affected me. It affected me so badly that the older I got the angrier I became, but I had no idea why I was angry. Or why I felt broken, hopeless, trapped with no escape. I’ve been married for years to a wonderful man who lifts me up instead of tearing me down and I found myself screaming at him for the slightest thing. Then I started remembering where I learned that behaviour. I remembered how it felt. It almost broke me. So many things make sense now. My anger. My fear. My hurt. I’m so ashamed. I feel disgusting. I feel all of the feelings now that I didn’t feel then. I shut down to survive - I was numb for over a decade. Now it’s like it happened yesterday. I was sexually assaulted by this man, this predator. I was coerced and manipulated and guilt tripped and threatened until I gave in. I remember thinking no so many times when I felt like I had to say yes. I had to say yes to the sex, to him getting me pregnant, so that he would leave me alone. So that he would stop yelling at me, or giving me the cold shoulder, or taking my medication away. I had to do whatever I could to survive. For a long time when I looked in the mirror I didn’t recognise myself. Now I do but I see that scared 19 year old again - and while I’m getting a part of myself back it’s a part I don’t want. I don’t want her shame, her guilt, her fear. I felt it anyway but now I know what it is, it doesn’t help. I am still trapped, because this man is the father of my daughter, and she loves her dad. She’s a teenager now, not far off the age I was. I know I need to protect her but sometimes I feel as violated by her as I was by him. He ruined my life then and he’s still doing it now. I can’t even let my husband touch me because I feel so ashamed.

PTSD-297,Finding support,"Last year I was receiving support for Complex PTSD resulting from childhood trauma. I had been seeing a Psychologist every 1-2 weeks for months. Leading up to Christmas they told me that they would contact me in the new year with availability. I thought this a little odd as we had had recurring appointments however didn't question it at the time. I never heard from the Psychologist again. Given my condition largely stems from abandonment and neglect it has taken me a while to consider seeing someone else, and to be honest I'm still not sure I'm ready, but I'm at least at the point that I can ask for advice on how others have gone about finding support they can trust?",Nickname_B31140EA-784A-46D7-AB5F-9EECEF04266C,Community Member,01-08-2023,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/finding-support/td-p/571488
PTSD-298,PTSD triggers and stigma,"Hi all There have been a couple of posts recently about negativity towards people who are triggered by events and go into a PTSD response which results in anxiety. I think there is a view out there by people who do not understand what Post Traumatic Stress that 'an industry is being promoted' by psychologists and others. How awful is that! The same can be said about a range of illness that have been diagnosed over the past 50 years or more. The scientific evidence and research that has happened in the past 50 years is so advanced that IMO people are afraid. IMO, it's much easier for people to live 'in ignorance' than to really look at what's happening in their environment. I truly believe PTSD falls in this category. It is so easy to say, it's 'all in your head'. Well, yeah, that maybe but that does not devalue what is happening for people. Nor does it mean that it's 'stupid', 'not real', 'not happening' etc. Yes, things do happen in your head, they can be good or not so good. That's why we have mental health plans. What I really want to debunk here is - that PTSD and it's triggers are STUPID. PTSD and triggers are real and have lasting effects both for the person who is experiencing them as do people who provide support to those people. You will find some talk about complex PTSD along with 'normal' PTSD. I'm not making any distinctions between the two, though from what I've read in the forums there is a difference. This thread is for people who get triggered and go into anxiety. Doesn't matter what the trigger is. Your triggers are real. They occur at times when you least expect them. No one else can say to you that you are stupid. Responses to triggers do happen. Triggers can: set off body responses, e.g. heart palpitations, sweating. be through sight, smell, sound, touch, feelings bring back memories of trauma cause intense physical and emotional reactions cause muscle tension.

I never spent any time alone with my paternal grandfather and therefore do not believe he abused me. I was approx 12yo when he died.what I don’t understand is, not including day of my uncles death, I only have 2 memories of my grandfather which are both fun, happy memories.

PTSD-302,What is the recovery time after sexual and emotional abuse?,"After being sexually abused by my father for ten years, I was then sexually and emotionally abused by my husband for 18 years. Currently, I am receiving therapy and my husband is not having sex with me (to allow me to heal). Unfortunately, my husband isn't patient and wants me to give him a timeline of when I'm ready to have sex again. He's tired of waiting and I'm supposed to tell him what to do in the meantime.I told him I'm working on it in the sessions. Having been abused for more than half my life, it will take time to heal. I've suffered much worse abuse from him than I did from my father. I need time. I only see my therapist every two weeks, and I have only seen her four times so far.Not only do we need to deal with sexual abuse, but also with emotional abuse. I explained to him that I cannot give him a timeline at this point, but he insisted that I give him one and he kept asking me what he was supposed to do for sex in the meantime.My patience with him ran out and I told him he was now reaping what he had sown. We would not have been in this situation if he hadn't treated me in such a manner and didn't force me to do things I didn't want to do. Now he is feeling upset and angry about something he caused. His actions have caused me to need therapy.He was very upset and I don't know what to say or do. I would appreciate any advice.Update:Almost a day had passed since he spoke to me last. His first action when he saw me was to take money out of his pocket and ask if he could buy me. He would pay me to have sex with him. It made me upset since this is what you do for a prostitute, and I told him he made me feel that way. However, he sees nothing wrong with that suggestion.

PTSD-303,Impending heart surgery worry,"My husband has recently found out during routine medical check that he may need possible heart valve replacement surgery. He is only 38, we have been together for nearly 20 years, we have one son who is 9. I have CPTSD from childhood trauma, growing up with a narcissistic parent. I struggle with death, anything new, especially medical issues. I am beyond petrified that something will happen to him during surgery and worried he will change afterwards. I know this is all natural worrying about what may or may not happen, but it’s really hard to comprehend right now. We will find out next Friday what will need to be done, this coincides with my birthday, which is already hard given my history. I’m trying to be strong and doing as much research as I can to prepare myself for the worst case scenario. I don’t want to scare myself but I feel like if I educate myself it won’t come as much of a shock when we do get told the news if he has to go through with surgery soon.I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this or is there anywhere I can turn to you to get advice?I know we will both probably need counselling, although I’m already seeing a psychologist and have been for quite some time.I want to be able to help him and we do have support from his family, but the worry of not knowing what’s going to happen really does make it difficult. We have had to put a lot of things on hold and a lot of plans have changed but I know in the Longrun, this is the right decision as I wouldn’t want something to happen to him in down the track, this is preventative and I know we are doing the right thing.

PTSD-305,Sleeping away from home questions,"Hi all,recently I was at a hotel with my husband and felt a sense of panic. Like I was trapped in my room and needed to leave. Had this on a plane once to. This fear of being away from home at night is growing is this a form of agoraphobia? I didn’t allow myself to leave as hubby was unwell and asleep and we were far from home so had a bath instead and had a talk with myself. I have started to inspect my anxieties and fears and find it useful to be my own therapist a bit to hold them up. I’ve realised not everything I feel is truth so like to have a look at it first. This fear seems to be growing worse as I get older and is entirely physical symptoms. A feeling of sadness, a trapped feeling, panic symptoms. Started in late 20s. A feeling of having to be very vigilant away fromhome. Not sleeping well at all unless things are just right. No sound and no light is what I need . Don’t go on holidays and don’t enjoy them only for this reason. I’d love to otherwise. It’s The sleeping, once I’m asleep I’m ok. I can’t do meds either as have a paradoxical reaction to most mental health meds (Valium makes me want to fight people antidepressants suicidal etc ) apart from this imwell and happy so don’t need meds. It’s the leaving the house that’s hard. Now even late afternoon I have to push myself in winter. I get tired and then mentally can’t deal with itehich I think it’s around vigilence as I was thinking about the whys, my early 20s came to mind. Twice in my 20s two individual men have broken into my room in different places while I was sleeping, once in student accomodation as they had keys to my room and the other in a house share a man sharing a cab home with a housemate both had taken advantage of me while I was asleep. Turning the lights on is what woke me in one incident and noise of someone in the room in the other.which imthinking is the link with need for darkness and quiet to sleep.I’ve never considered it as a reason for my symptoms as for some trasonfont really rember it apart from it seemed better and safer to go along with the intrusion then fight so it wasn’t violent, but I did feel violated after. Just tried to brush it off and now a bit forgotten. do you think this could be the cause of my bodies physicalreaction to being away fromhome at night? should I speak to someone about it? does anyone else have trouble with this and what has helped. thanks",laureah21,Community Member,10-07-2023,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sleeping-away-from-home-questions/td-p/569855
PTSD-306,Husband struggling with mental health,"Hi there, Life’s been tough for me and my husband for the last 2 years and I’m hoping someone can give me some insight or advice.My husband has been a Police officer for 10+ years. He has been battling himself for many years, searching for happiness, peace and ease in his life but forever battling his thoughts and emotions. His job comes with horrible trauma and grief and I am very aware of that. He does have PTSD and dealing with complete burnout. A year ago, after him being distant, withdrawn, short tempered and not being a partner in life with me for some time, he told me he doesn’t know if he wants to be with me anymore. My heart broke, as at that time our baby was not even 1. I tried and tired to support and understand him but he was unable to say anything more than “I don’t know”. For years everyone around has seen his decline in general tolerance, care for himself, his lack of effort and empathy for others and his need to control everything increased. We ended up separating last year. The separation hasn’t been a clean cut. We talk always, FaceTime for our son, still gather in family and friend situations…our relationship just felt so unfinished and blurry, but he was still unable to give me or himself clarity.Earlier this year he attended a mental health retreat and came back renewed, inspired and mentally clear. He said he wants to be with me and wants a future together….just not right now. He needs more time to work on himself. I’m trying my best to continue to be supportive and allow him that time and space but he is so focused on himself he doesn’t give any effort to me and our relationship. I am needing to rebuild trust, I need reassurance, I need to be shown love from him and I need to know that there’s no pushing me away, I need to be shown that we can be a team again and make it work. But it feels like he doesn’t have capacity for that.I have been a single mum for nearly a year now, dealing with heartbreak, loneliness, exhaustion and sadness on my own- While everyone is trying to support him and help him, and I’m feeling like collateral damage. I am wanting to move forward together but it feels like I’m expected to wait forever and forgive unconditionally. There’s been no accountability from him for what this situation has done to me and my son. No apology, no recognition. I’m feeling lost, I don’t know what to do anymore. I nearly at my breaking point of not being able to live in this heartbreak limbo. What should I do? Continue to wait with no guarantee or take steps to move my life into a different direction?

PTSD-308,How do I help my husband? PTSD,"Hi, I'm new here and I'm posting this out of desperation with the hope that I might be able to find some advice on how to help my husband and save our relationship. We have been married for almost 10 years and have children together. He is a wonderful, genuine person and I love him to death. From the day he was born he has experienced trauma. Childhood abuse, extreme domestic violence in his family home, surviving and escaping a wartorn country after watching many die. He eventually married and had a family which led to a divorce in the most traumatic way. She took his children and she ran and vowed he would never see them again. He came to Australia and got remarried to me. I am almost certain that he has PTSD. He has extreme defensiveness and episodes of anger that I cannot understand. At times i ask him a simple question and he behaves as if I have attacked him. Other times he lashes out at me for no reason and I can't understand why he has become so angry. He needs to have control of everything and I have fought him tooth and nail since the day we met to have control as well. If I did not have such a strong determined personality myself, he would be controlling me too, but I have not allowed that to happen. He is not abusive and he hates violence. However, his defensiveness and anger it's taking its toll on me and I don't know what to do to help him. He refuses to accept that there is something wrong, and he refuses to speak to anybody about it. I can't even speak to him about my own feelings, because if I do he interprets it as if I am attacking him. And no matter how much I explain to him that I am only trying to explain my own feelings or hurt. It doesn't make a difference. For example, the other day I was expressing how exhausted I am juggling so many things at the same time. He responded to me as if I had accused him of being the reason for my exhaustion. This happens all the time, I feel like I cannot turn to my husband and tell him anything. Discuss my feelings with him because he will interpret it as an attack. I can't discuss my problems with him because he will try to control the situation. I can't try to make a decision with him because he will make the decision for me. I can't go out in public with him because I don't know if I might look at him the wrong way or say something the wrong way that will make him suddenly yell at me. I know this sounds like we have a horrible relationship but we don't. He's such an incredible person and I want to help him and not lose him. What do I do if he will not get help? How do I reassure him that I'm not a threat? How do I reduce his anxiety?",Anna-anastasia,Community Member,25-06-2023,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-do-i-help-my-husband-ptsd/td-p/568777

But as I cannot access the systems from home I am limited as to what I can achieve. I dread going to work and I hate it there. It is chaotic and stressful. I am coming home absolutely shattered but so wound up from the hours of stress I drink too much to try to calm down. It is a very bad situation. I know I have only been there a short while but I cannot see it getting better. Everyone is focused on sales....not on serving customers who are there for basic transactions. There is never enough staff to help out. It is appalling. I am already looking for another job. I am so depressed and disillusioned. I was so happy to get this job but as usual once they get you in you are just another number to make money for them. Not to mention the sheer volume of dreadful customers I am forced to deal with daily. Smelly, foul, belligerent 'people' that upset my sensitivities. I am so sick of everything. I just want a peaceful life and to have a job I like to go to and know I am making a difference. I am on a disability pension for reasons I will not dwell on here. Suffice it to say the reason I am on it is being flung in my face daily. I try to do the right thing. Work, make some contribution. I lose most of my pension for working this job. I feel if I can't do it anymore I will be ridiculed and laughed at by my 'family'. I am so over it all.",Gamechanger,Community Member,15-06-2023,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/new-job-causing-major-stress/td-p/567973
PTSD-315,I think I have a person in my head,"Hi. I don’t really know where to post this or what to say.I’m really not sure what’s going on with me, but I’m starting to think this is abnormal. For most of my life I’ve had what I called an imaginary best friend, he felt like a lot more than that but that’s what I called him. Then I moved when I was 17 and it felt like he died. I genuinely felt like he died and I couldn’t think him up anymore and I grieved for two years and it felt like I lost a part of me. today he came back. It was pretty normal we just had conversations and picked up where we left off and really clicked and it all felt natural. The thing is it’s like he is himself, I don’t tell him what to say or do. I am very aware that he’s not real and he’s in my mind, I’m not hallucinating him in front of me or anything. But it’s starting to scare me a little bit because I’m not sure if it’s me going crazy. It’s like he’s in my head and I can just talk to him and he’ll say whatever he wants to say back. He feels like a completely different person to me. If you know what this is please tell me.

PTSD-318,Sexual assault by a close friend,"I'm not sure whether what has happened to me qualifies as sexual assault, and I have no intentions of taking any action regarding the incident, but I am just looking for some guidance on something that happened to me 2 days ago that has deeply upset me and I am struggling to process. I am a 61 year old hetrosexual male and have been happily married to my wife for over 30 years. Two days ago, we spent the day and night with two very close male friends (they are gay) who have been very close friends for 28 years. We frequently socialise with them and have a few drinks with them and we have never had any inappropriate issues in all the time that we have known them. However, the other night, when my wife and one of our friends went to bed, the other friend (lets call him Michael) made some very unwanted sexual advances towards me. I quickly made it clear that I was not interested, but I probably made the mistake of being being too nice about it and trying to make light of it and consoling him for his mistake. His partner came into the room as I was consoling him and he appeared to be mortified, but I'm not sure that he was (I may be reading too much into it, but I think he may also have been interested in joining in). anyway, after his partner went back to bed, Michael continued to persist with his attempt to engage in sexual conduct with him. After trying to make it clear that I wasn't interested, and feeling extremely uncomfortable, I went to bed abruptly and me and my wife left in the middle of the night. To complicate this, we are also very close friends with Michael's brother and his family, so throughout all of this I was (and still am) very worried about the impact that this could have on those relationships. Since the incident, we have had some communications from Michael's partner (whatsapp messages) that appear to be just behaving as if nothing has happened. I haven't responded to any of them, as I don't believe that I should just pretend it didn't happen. I am upset, disappointed and very unsure how I should deal with this going forward. Any advice would be gratefully received.",Peter_W_,Community Member,16-06-2023,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sexual-assault-by-a-close-friend/td-p/568021
PTSD-319,new person,"Hi everyone not sure what parts to disclose here, feeling very uneasy posting. I feel like a lot of people here, know that I'm socially isolated but feel it's safer this way. I have a lot of mixed feelings due to covid19; feeling freer or even happier that movements were restricted as I have had little choice but to live this way for a long time. Then I realised how odd this reaction is, opposite to what I was hearing at work. Simultaneously I felt huge grief for the world. I'm experiencing compassion fatigue from all of this. my life has been wrought with trauma & grief, tremendous violence & loss. I desperately sought help from authorities to stop things over many decades. I have fought so hard through courts etc, I know it has cost me a lot of mental stability a lot of the time. At least my children and I are safe atm. Feeling safe is another thing entirely! happiness eludes me. I strive for the happiness of my children. I don't know how to attain personal happiness, so have strived for contentment. I work hard physically but feel far more exhausted by my mind. flashbacks and memories often come back relentlessly in my waking hours and in my dreams. Working hard physically helps me sleep better I used to be very sociable, quite athletic and had a large family. The abuse has taken its toll. My relationships were undermined by the abuser, so they are lost. My physical health was severely impacted by the abuse also. I have a counsellor but I was advised by a close friend who is studying psychology to seek a more intensive type of therapy. I have completed countless hours in therapy through books, online and in person over decades. My counsellor is very impressed by my persistence, resilience and recovery but I feel awful most of the time. I have no relationships with extended family anymore which is very sad for me. I have basically given up trying since doors are constantly closed on that front. Soon I plan to take leave from my work to support my children all struggling in their learning from home programs. I will have to take leave on far less pay, so this presents obvious issues to an already stretched financial situation. I know there is no magic cure for all the issues I have at hand but I still have hope that things will improve and that I can feel happy one day. I pray there are answers within this forum for me.

PTSD-320,Too much drama,"Hi All Not sure what Im looking for maybe just for someone to say, I feel ya, give me a pat on the back... I feel defeated by life and don't trust anyone or anything anymore, I feel the good things are a set up. Just like everyone else my life has had it moments.Childhood - Sexual Abuse for 5 yearsTeenage years - Depression, rebellion, drug abuse, crime etc. A bad relationship, which ended with intervention orders, which were broken by physical damage and property damage.Get my life together, meet a nice man at 19, married at 22Adult years - 6 months after getting married, we were in a serious road crash and 4 people died, my parents included, my husband and I were seriously injured. Life injures. Husband I divorced 4 years later, it was amicable we had both fallen out of love trying to repair ourselves and we weren't the same people anymore. About a year later I meet another guy, relationship was normal, we started to try and have a child, due to damage from the crash and 3 miscarriages they worked out I couldn't have kids. The last miscarriage however, he didn't care and walked out on me. (literally packed his stuff and left never to be seen again)Dealt with the fact I wouldn't have kids and moved on with life.Fast forward another year and I meet the man on my dreams, he wants to look after me, gave me an instant family and everything I needed. Should have seen the narcissist coming but just wanting to be loved and that family feel again. I wanted a baby even more now, this family was everything I needed. So after two more miscarriages I got help and managed to carry to full term. I had an emergency c section, the nurse pulled the umbilical cord out when she broke my water. This is where I noticed things changed. He started to control everything, had to stay at the hospital that night, made me go home the next day. Life went down hill from here. The last beating he gave me, he her my child and nearly killed me, this wasn't the first time. I had to leave my baby with him to run to the neighbours to call the police. He was arrested and went to jail for two years. It's only now Im realising what he did and all the things he did.I get help see the right people and take the meds.

PTSD-322,Trigger warning - PTSD after suicide of partner,"Hi,I am 5 years post suicide of my husband. While I have sought counselling and other means to deal with my grief and to deal with the loss over the years, I have recently found myself ""triggered"". I have had a few encounters with a relative and a close friend who confided in me regarding their mental health state, because ""I would understand"" that they had recently had suicidal thoughts. Thankfully they both have and are continuing with the assistance they need and are being supported. I have 2 questions: How do I deal with those who think that because my husband committed suicide that I would understand?? While I completely empathise with them and want to support them. In reality I do not understand. I was left behind. Secondly, when sharing this with me, I began to shake uncontrollably, my breath rate increased and I felt sick. Even the following day, I felt numb?? I want to be there for my friends and family, but I also do not want to feel like this. I have spoken to my counsellor and was advised that they need to respect my boundaries etc but I care for my friends and family and if I am needed I want to be able to support them as they have all supported me.

PTSD-323,Grief CPTSD and anxiety,Needing a bit of support after having my dog put to sleep last week. I’m devastated but slowly navigating my way out of it however I’ve noticed my anxiety seems to started again and after months of nothing it’s come as quite a shock. I actually ended up having a full blown attack on Friday the day after we put him down and it’s as if I’ve triggered my CPtsd ( result of losing mum at young age and neglect from parental figures ) I had no sleep for 3 days as a result. I just feel like I’ve gone backwards and it really scares me. I’ve been on a long road to recovery since my last big breakdown 4 years ago and I’m even coming of my antidepressants I’ve been doing they well. I’m so upset and annoyed with myself for allowing the anxiety to get on top of me again and my last episode was very scary for me it’s as if I’ve lost trust in myself. I hope this all makes sense I’m just sort of lost right now. I also worry I’m not grieving right or enough. I cried the day before we took him and all day the next 2 days and felt so much pain like a heaviness on my heart. I know I should be kind to myself but it’s so hard when I have been in recovery and this setback has scared me. I see my psychologist in a fortnight and I do acupuncture with a therapist next week.

PTSD-324,"I have always had a dog to be my person but ,,,,","Hello all I have spiralled somewhat in the past few weeks as my beautiful Sheltie girl Echo died in Feb, she was 15. I grew up with a dog who was my sole source of support as a child, then had a dog while raising my children and little Echo came into my life 15 years ago. Although I have a few friends and some are even quite close, I have always bonded best with my dogs. Echo was made an emotional support dog and then after she developed arthritis and I begin struggling with the mobility issues, we just spent lockdown and beyond together, and it was lovely.I have spent a couple of months starting to look for my next great love. I am very choosy as I want to make sure that I can fit the needs of the dog in terms of space and exercise, etc. However, I do check rescue websites, but the majority of the dogs are unsuitable for me and me for them. I have spent hours and hours every day for the last couple of months looking at puppies that would be suitable, and who I'm drawn to, but the prices of dogs is completely out of my reach. I tried putting a deposit on a dog as I thought I was getting some payment, which unfortunately didn't come through. This meant I lost my $600 deposit, which is fair, but it's put me even further behind. I don't see any way that I can raise the money I need and I'm beginning to panic. I have ever be without a dog. I don't know how to be without a dog. I don't understand why they are so very expensive, are completely out of the reach of most people I would think.I'm not looking at expensive, designer dogs, but every puppy I have found, has been around $2000, and this is just not doable. I don't know how to reconfigure everything to be without another living presence to draw comfort from and find meaning with and I feel so ashamed and pathetic that I can't even manage to buy myself a dog. Just a dog. I guess I am just needing to vent a little bit, as I was starting to hit the panic button today.

PTSD-327,Sexual abuse in childhood- yayyyy,"Hi everyone, I have posted about my life before on here, but as I don't have therapy or a consistent form of professional support anymore, I'm finding myself on here again. Recently, I was just watching a movie with my mum, that had an extremely specific scene about a brother sexually abusing a sister throughout childhood. This hit way too close to home and I started crying without really even understanding why at first. My best guess is it was a major trigger for me that hasn't come up before. I used to think there was something wrong with me, for only really crying about it a few times about what had happened, but now I think I realise I just hadn't really come across triggers. I started crying because I realised for the first time that it had actually been going on since I was about four, and it just built up from there, and led to the major incident. This made me extremely sad, angry.. and probably every other emotion as well. Just to realise it was there all along. This is extremely difficult to talk about clearly, but in short, my brother and I were not normal, and the worst thing is we didn't even realise it was wrong, I'm guessing because our dad was abusive. No one knew. until I was 12, when he fully sexually abused me. But I didn't say no, I didn't know how to even reply. And I still feel so bad that my brother got the worst of the consequences afterwards, which completely ruined him. I feel so bad, because maybe if I had realised we both had always had this relationship earlier, then maybe he would be a bit better. Now his living back with our dad, being manipulated day by day, the worst thing is I cant do anything about it. Sorry if this is kind of just a major fat dump for literally everyone reading this, I always feel so bad when telling this story, because no one else should really have to hear it. But my mum cant stand hearing about it, shes too hurt by it. So this is me just trying to talk, idk why I'm writing tbh. anyway. that's that, I'm just not really sure what to do with these emotions, a part of me has been really good a keeping them out of mind for a while, but this has just brought it all back up.

PTSD-330,Confused,"Strong TW... Mentions. Childhood sexual abuse, Incest, Mental health. Flashbacks have been extremely vivid in past weeks and now more so in past days since receiving terrible news from an unnamed Government department.I guess in the MH industry they call it compartmentalising, personally want to say it's trying to wrap my head around it, trying to find 'my' way of processing such news.Some of you here may or may not understand why I need to BUT have to justify my childhood abusers actions. My thoughts are cluttered and blocked up with the notion it wasn't that bad.I have been diagnosed with a fair few MH labels DID (dissociative identity disorder), been one of them. All I can manage day to day which is a burden in itself is this singular thought. Many of you may say to try, dig into my self care coping tool kit and find a different and more positive approach. Its not possible. I can't, believe me I've tried. With different ages the abuse was happening in my past, now they are fronting with and without these flashbacks. Other C-PTSD symptoms are feeling equally as worse, no, or lack of sleep being one of them, which I know isn't helping my thoughts become any clearer or kinder towards oneself.I needed to write out these thoughts of mine to someone else as they are stealing and taking my energy away from me. Plus I'm drowning. I'm struggling.Life in my current world isn't going well, active trauma. It's complicated. I don't know if there's such a thing as a DID episode or it's just another MH downward spiral I'm going through.

I am wanting to go home, to my family of origin, they are all my abusers but in my current thoughts it's where I felt needed and safe (I know that sounds very confusing) but really they were using me anyway they wanted. It's all different there now though, it's 2023, we are all older and have gone in different directions. That was then decades ago, I'm finding it impossible in seeing the difference. I am, we all are feeling very confused and disoriented.

I do know it from being physically abused on a pretty much daily basis by the guys at school, pretty much from early primary to the last day of year 12. The farewell gift I received from one of my bullies was to fly kick me to the head knocking me out. I told my parents, I told the school, I told anyone who would listen but no one did or was able to do anything about it.My home life was strict, very religious. We had church people over what feels like every night, from an early age I became the coffee maker for all these guests. I became a complete loner and my music tastes changed to metal, which was not well recieved in a strict religious house. I was forced to study music at school so I chose guitar, was never very good. I also had to do piano for a number of years, which I was even worse at. I had to study math and English through out. I was good at math but in Year 12 I needed a tutor for English. Mum was very controlling growing up but also, I would say aggressive. There were outbursts if she didnt get her way. Her and Dad would fight more than I would think was normal, not physical though. Mum did suffer from Depression and spent quite a time away in a facility when I was in year 7, I didnt understand the before this or why she had been taken away.

PTSD-333,Family covered up sexual abuse,"My uncle tried to groom me starting from when I was 12 (He would pay special attention to me). I didn't realise his intentions until I was about 14 and he started sending me emails that were inappropriate. At first I just emailed back until a particular email confirmed the way he felt about me. At the same time, my parents told me they would organise a skiing holiday for me in new Zealand where my uncle lives. His wife (mums sister) would come to Australia for a visit while I would go there and be with my uncle and my two cousins. I realised that this way his way of getting me all alone so he could potentially do more than just flirt by email. I told my mum and she said she would keep me safe and make sure I was never alone with him and to cut off emails with him. She said we couldn't tell anyone else because it would hurt our family. I didn't have to see my uncle often, but he would come to Australia for big family events. When I was around 24 I told my aunty what had happened. My aunty almost seemed relieved as he had accused her of being crazy every time she got angry about his attention to younger girls. She still didn't want others to know and I respected that. Now I'm 27 and in therapy again for some recent panic attacks. The night of my last appointment we talked about my mum covering this up I was a mess. All I could think about was what he did and how she valued everyone else's feelings over my own. I kept thinking what if he abused me as a young child and I don't remember (I realise this is unlikely but I'm a paranoid person and don't remember much of my early childhood due to bullying). I didn't go to work the next day and spent it either asleep or crying. That night I rang my mum still in a bad state and asked her if she could talk to my aunty about uninviting my uncle to my wedding in October. I said maybe he could say he needs to work or make another excuse. My mum's response initially was that it would be an awkward conversation for her but I explained what had hurt me so much and how it still does. She agreed to talk to my aunty. The next day she told me that she ended up telling my dad. I haven't talked to her since and I'm nervous to hear what happened when she talked to my aunty and to know how my dad is taking it.

PTSD-334,Denial of sexual abuse in extended family,"Potentially distressing content warning Hi, I’m currently trying to bring myself to communicate with an extended family member regarding her ongoing denial of four years of sexual abuse done to a cousin when she was a child. In fact she pretends the person abused doesn’t exist. The mother of this child (different to above person) blamed her daughter for the abuse and abandoned her. The perpetrator got away with it. This same perpetrator attempted to groom me as a child but I was fortunately never alone with him. Another relative did as well in front of other family including my parents who did nothing to stop his behaviour, but again I was never completely alone and apart from suggestive comments and being leered at and asked to do things for him, nothing actually happened. He later went to prison for abusing another under-age person. I’m not sure my question fits here because it’s primarily about the abuse of someone else. But what I’d like to know is how have others handled denial of sexual abuse in families and the ongoing lies and cover ups that can go on for years? As a younger adult I have experienced two sexual assaults and so I feel all the more angry about how the abuse of a family member is denied. I refuse to pretend the person doesn’t exist and I have nothing to do with her mother who abandoned her. The other family member is trying to get me to connect with the mother and I will not do this. This keeps coming up at the moment and I’m thinking of writing a letter to the family member I’m struggling with right now. I believe she tries to cover up the abuse because she has been scared for years to rock the boat. But I feel I have to rock the boat even though it’s likely to be destructive of my relationship with family members. I only found out about the abuse of this cousin in my 20s when my parents told me, years after it occurred. The perpetrator died recently which has put a spotlight back on this issue. Has anyone had to handle something like this? What did you do? How did it go? I have a feeling it’s going to go badly but I refuse to play the denial game. I have never met the cousin in question as she was ex-communicated from her family decades ago. I’m only recently discovering the extent to which other family have gone to cover up the abuse and it’s upsetting me. My parents have died so I can’t discuss it with them now.",Eagle Ray,Valued Contributor,04-03-2023,PTSD and trauma,37,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/denial-of-sexual-abuse-in-extended-family/td-p/560306
PTSD-335,Being Triggered & Pregnancy,"Hi All, I've just had a bit of a day. I have not been triggered for a long time and work with at risk youth, so constantly exposed to situations. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar and Complex trauma, all has been under control for quite some time. Second trimester of pregnancy, which I know can trigger issues in bipolar, but finding it is more the trauma that is getting triggered.Today I was simply in some basic training, going through a scenario and a story shared triggered me big time. To the point of dissociation and flashbacks. To put into perspective, I am the colleague everyone comes to, because I can cope with all situations and often find pathways through. I took me a while to get to this point, but never in last 5 years have I been triggered by a real situation let alone a case study.I have done all my little tricks and things, but nothing is really working. I simply have not been able to shut up the feelings, thoughts, memories, etc. Really panicked about the pregnancy on top of it. Just not ok.In the back of my mind is is any of this going to trigger my Bipolar and cause an episode or the psychosis that can occur during pregnancy.... lets face it, if I have an episode, psychosis is on the agenda for me anyways. Again, I have not had a serious episode for years and really do not need the fall out in my life it causes.

PTSD-336,A flying monkey or possible friend,"A little over 7months ago I left a group of friends after we let in a narcissist who gradually pushed me out.This person used all the classic tactics like triangulation, projection, never speaking directly to me etc.Had the other group members convinced that I wasn't worth the friendship. So when I spoke up about how I felt like there had been a shift they all stonewalled me. I left. They've all ignored me these past months. Crossing the road if they saw me, avoiding eye contact. The narc herself is the only one who has walked past me with a smirk on her face looking directly at me. Fast forward to the last 2 weeks. Suddenly a member of the group is acknowledging me, saying hi and talking. Surface level, but still.She seemingly isn't in the group any longer. I was and am very hesitant. This person was the one I considered the best friend of the group. Also the one who broke my heart the most. I'm sort of stuck between hoping she has realised what went down, maybe she got similar treatment. Or - its part of the game with the narc sitting as a big spider pulling the strings. The rest of the group, who've been ignoring me for months are now glaring my way. I've never seen anybody look with such hate in their eyes as when they looked.Maybe they think I told her my version of a narrative they tried so desperately to control..even if I haven't.Being a scapegoat regardless to what I have or haven't done. And I just don't know if I should risk letting this person back in. I miss what was, but maybe I am just thinking back to the golden days before she was so easily duped by the narcissist and gladly left me behind. I am an introvert, a people pleaser and find it extremely hard making friends. Maybe that's why it has this pull on me. I have been thinking that IF I was to reconnect with this friend it has to start with an open talk about the fact that she hurt me and that I will be needing a policy on honesty and openness. But still very hesitant whether or not I should bother, if it's safe.",Orangeicy,Community Member,01-04-2023,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/a-flying-monkey-or-possible-friend/td-p/562352
PTSD-337,BPD Wife Suicide Infidelity,"This has been my extremely painful experience. I am terrified writing this as I am full of fear that I will be recognised. I met a beautiful woman and it was bliss. We had an instant connection. As time progressed I honestly felt she was the one. Soul mate even. The absolute funniest person ever. Maybe 9 months into our relationship I noticed one night that her belly was extremely bloated. She was athletic. I ended up taking her to the hospital. This is the beginning of my partner getting sick. Looking back I knew nothing as she hid and lied which will come up later. All I knew is that my partner had a serious heart infection. Life threatening. Basically the next year I supported her in every way. Even though I earn good money I got a second job. I paid all her bills. Her credit cards. Her rent. Everything. To ensure that she had everything. This cost me a lot of my friends. Telling me that she is not my responsibility ect. I was getting mentally sick. Really sick. I was with the woman I love. It was her and I verse the world. She would hug me and cry asking me to never leave. I did my absolute best for her. I loved her. The inevitable day comes and we are in hospital. Over the next week I was communicating with her parents living in another state. This was going to be a 6 month hospital stay. Then I get a call saying my partner has disappeared. What? Why? She has BPD. What? The next few weeks are a blur. Not knowing anything. She could drop dead any second. I received a call from a Dr saying that she had been found and is in another hospital. Basically I was told to not come as her whole family were there. That was hard. I reminded myself. This is not about me. I am going crazy as I want to see her.I am going nuts. Walking 30km a day. Then on the 8th day I receive a call that she has passed. I received a call a week later saying she was buried the day before. I know this was hard on everyone involved. The next year I was in a haze. Lost my business of 20 years due to not being able to work. Not paying bills. Not washing. Not opening mail etc.It was like I had been hit in the head. I was in daze. What happened? My best friend, my heart. I then was going through our computer. WTF? She had 4 men. ISex Video about 6 weeks before her death. Old man. Talking and laughing about taking all my money. Laughing that she is going to die.",2_Shattered,Community Member,16-08-2021,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/bpd-wife-suicide-infidelity/td-p/14281
PTSD-338,Struggling to move on,"Hi,I don’t even know why I am posting here, I guess I am just at a loss on what to do and how to start trying to pick myself back up again. my ex broke up with me two weeks ago. He did it in such a way that he blocked me and completely cut me off, refusing to talk to me. We went from discussing what movie we were going to see to him screaming down the phone that I am fat and ugly, and that he doesn’t want me anymore. I went to his house to talk to him and to try and get my things back, and he told me that I was stalking him when that wasn’t my intention at all. I just was so confused I didn’t know what I had done wrong, and just wanted my stuff back and to make sure he was alright. It was so out of the blue. He trash talked me to mutual friends, and called me so many names, he has called me a wh*re and a sl*t amongst other things because I have kids to different fathers - all out of long term relationships, but it has made me feel really awful. The same day he broke up with me I found out that my contract was expiring and the business can’t afford to keep me on so I am essentially jobless in three weeks and struggling to find another contract. I feel so overwhelmed and stressed, and the break up itself put me into a major depressive episode where I’ve just stayed in bed and cried for about a week and a half. I had only just begun to pull myself out of it when he got back in touch around concert tickets we had that we were going to go see together. We decided to go together, and had a nice time. Since then I have spoken to him briefly over the phone every day for ten minutes. He refuses to give me any more of his time claiming he is busy with work and that he doesn’t know what he wants, after giving me the impression that we could work things out. When I said okay I need to walk away and let you go, because it isn’t fair for me he then didn’t want me to do that either. I have a lot of past trauma from DV previously, and I feel like this entire experience has triggered me. Any advice on how to let go and move on, and pull myself out of this major depressive episode? I’m so tired of feeling tired and lost.",Quinn2,Community Member,30-03-2023,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-to-move-on/td-p/562206
PTSD-339,PTSD from past relationships,"Hi I came across this website and hope to have someone relate to my story or offer ways of healing. I am a victim of domestic violence with the father of my child whom I was with for 7.5yrs. He was a manipulative person, I never felt loved by him he treated me terribly and would abuse me in front of our child. We would argue over him not wanting to provide financially and he later on turned to drugs. I was contacted by DCP as there we’re 42 police reports of myself, family and neighbours calling the police for help on various occasions. I cried when I found that out, it had gone too far and there was no way I was getting my child taken off me so I gained the courage to leave. I began counseling and after 6 months I was able to see that we we’re better off apart.Two years later I got into another relationship with someone who mentally abused me. I confided in him and trusted that he would be understanding of my past but instead used my weaknesses against me. He lied to me about wanting to love me better and that he too had been in a domestic violence relationship which was a lie. I ended up finding out that he was still with his ex partner and was playing both of us. It destroyed me as we had planned so much of our futures together. I fell into depression and stopped eating. My motivation to work or gym had stopped and I would only get up out of bed to get my son to school, otherwise I’d go straight home and lay in bed all day asking myself why I wasn’t good enough for him. I cried myself to sleep too many times and felt worthless. My past trauma is now affecting my relationship now, I can’t help but to think he doesn’t have good intentions and I’m always on high alert of any signs of abandonment. We are continuously arguing because I overthink things and it’s very unhealthy for the both of us. I love him so much and just want us to be happy but my PTSD is ruining that",Rhysah,Community Member,27-03-2023,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-from-past-relationships/td-p/561951
PTSD-340,Former Love Interest,"I have never been diagnosed with PTSD (mainly because getting a diagnosis scares me a bit), but I keep having reoccurring dreams about a former love interest of mine who left me three years ago (I had fancied him for seven years). He's constantly on my mind, so much so that it almost terrifies me when I think I'm going to bump into him at the mall or at the city. He used to drive a white car (can't remember the brand), and even seeing those woosh past me on the road scares me; I fear I may see his face in the window. And when I went to Kmart a month or so ago, I felt this surge of anxiety when I saw a man that looked really, really similar to him. He was at the entrance checking people's receipts and greeting customers, but I was so relieved when I saw he had brown eyes instead of blue like the love interest, and his leg muscles were thicker than said love interest (who was practically bone thin). I feel like my experience is too small to label as trauma, but it feels like trauma to me. It ticks pretty much all the symptoms that fall under PTSD, but I still feel like it's not ""good enough"" or not ""extreme"" enough to be labelled as trauma. This man was neither abusive nor hurtful. He was actually a really nice guy, but he had flaws. Flaws that my brain refuses to overlook. He was several red flags and yet I walk past him as if I'm colourblind.I'm not sure why I'm sharing this, but maybe someone else is going through the same thing out there...I just feel stupid for feeling this way.",Shazzyy,Community Member,25-03-2023,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/former-love-interest/td-p/561741

PTSD-343,Car accident + grief,"Hello everyone, I was proudly better from depression and anxiety. I finally stopped seeing a therapist after 2 years of treatment. I found a good job two years ago and was overall very happy with how I've turned my life around. Sadly tragedy strikes faster than I could respond. A very dear uncle of mine (who helped raised me) was diagnosed with bowl cancer in 2022, so in August I decided to quit my job and fly overseas to spend as much time with him as possible. The plan was I would go visit him first and the rest of my family would go once I've returned to Brisbane. However the 2nd day I have arrived Brisbane, we were told he unfortunately passed away. His death was more painful than it needed to be, since he contracted Covid. That mixed with late state cancer, the doctors in that country could do very little. I'm still extremely distraught and in disbelief about his passing. Then just when I felt I was getting better, I was in a car accident. Upon contacting lots and lots of free help...I found myself to be uninsured and fighting the insurance company on my own. I thought my car was insured but due to a huge misunderstanding and miscommunication, I'm not. I'm unemployed, trying to find a job...grieving over a loved one (who's service I couldn't attend) and now this...my friends and family have been supportive but I'm just so stressed out.

PTSD-344,How do I explain how someone's words effect me so deeply that they will be mindful?,"Hello all, I was in a dv situation with my ex partner. I have always suffered with anxiety and depression but not ptsd. I have started dating again. It got so bad with my ex I left 4mths pregnant and he came after me and threatened me with a weapon. He was never jailed, not for breaching my vro numerous times, breaching his bail conditions and his intensive community order 5 times. He stalked harassed and hounded me. I was put in a refuge, I was the one in jail. Miles away from my support network, no one allowed to visit. 3yrs later I am grateful for my beautiful daughter. One of his biggest things to terrorised me with was blame. Everything he didn't like was my fault and I mean everything. This was my dialy torture be blamed for things I had no control over or nothing to do with. I started seeing a new guy. Yesterday after a misunderstanding through text I got in trouble for things outside of my control. It triggered me big time. He has said he suffers with anxiety so I would have thought me telling him that his harsh unkind words was triggering to my ptsd would have been met with a bit more understanding. He had apologised but when those anxiety feelings take hold a flip I am sorry doesn't stop the reactions. I got the ""well all guys are not your ex"" oh really geez well that just makes it just fine now you said that. I don't want to go into the nitty gritty as it just makes it worse but also can I really be bothered to explain when even with someone who claims to know what anxiety is like says that.

PTSD-345,TRIGGERING! I only really came to terms yesterday that my father abused me,"So I see my psychologist monthly ( do it monthly even if you think it won't help, please go and at least talk to let it all out!).I was having problems now with my job, not knowing how to go on or what to do with my life... My parents both passed away from different types of cancer in one year of each other, they didn't make it past 60. As good as parents they were in the past, my father developed alcoholism and my teenager years were bad from both parties. TRIGGERING so please only read if you can handle it: My father would come into my room sometimes and be blind drunk, it was never in the sense of really out there sexual, but he would be naked and abuse his strength and wrestle me to the ground, telling me if I was being raped right now, how would I get out?! And if we didn't try to fight we were weak.At 18 I was a grown woman and he was an old man, and I fought and kicked and punched him while crying. He left, looked at me crying like he was proud/sad at the same time and never did it again. I told my psychologist and she responded with that this was still sexual abuse. Now, he was only naked this one time but it stuck with me because of it and also all the times he just came into my room to belittle me and say I will never amount to anything. I felt so confused yesterday when she told me, I still don't see this as sexual abuse but then, my eyes are more open than they used to be...Even today I felt like something different opened up in my personality, I felt somehow stronger and not so fragile in that I would let others try to emotionally blackmail me. My partner is going through a rough point in his life, but instead of listening like I usually do, I told him to go and talk to a professional then if he is having trouble. He seemed upset....I just feel angry, like, I can't deal with his crap right now... I still feel very confused at the moment, I know my problems seem like nothing compared to what you are all going through and I must seem pretty insensitive in some way, it's just that this revelation really has shaken me as I still don't want to admit it was abuse, because in some way, it wasn't nice, I don't feel like I want to seem like a victim when this situation isn't as bad as what ""real"" victims have gone through?",Jessksch,Community Member,03-03-2023,PTSD and trauma,11,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/triggering-i-only-really-came-to-terms-yesterday-that-my-father/td-p/560240

PTSD-352,Trauma of separated parents,"""Trauma"" such an underrated word for what is in most cases, grief. Perhaps it trauma followed by grief, either way. when a parent separates from their spouse and children, it is devastating. One day were were full time parents, neighbours, community members, a spouse, a pet owner and so on... the next you might not be any of those things. If you've lost most of those roles then who are you now? Regardless of many of those things it was the loss and judgement of neighbours that intrigued me the most. One neighbour ignored me when walking in town early to collect my kids. Eventually this happened again so I approached. ""you left you wife and children what kind of man are you"". My reply- ""perhaps you dont know what went on behind closed doors""? People present themselves in public far different than when they treat their spouse with contempt and narcissistic tendencies... forgive me, I not need to justify. So, you spend your first weeks on a new fitness effort and dwell and dwell, you've lost your environment and yes you are a dad (or mum) that has reduced your access to 2 days a fortnight which is from 100% down to 15%. (the lucky ones get shared 50% custody). Then along comes holiday time a few weeks with them is gold. Does this arrangement feel like you are still a parent? well, no, in an instant your are along without that pitter patter. IWhen I left I decided to not only be the best part time dad ever, I'd also move on and become the man I knew I could be. I bought land, built my own kit home and worked long hours. What are the main elements of propulsion that I used to succeed? Move on from the marriage, the memories, the negativity, the child support.

I've lost interest in everything and spend my days at home,making excuses not to go out. I decided to see my dr to discuss this. He said the stress that I am under us the major contributing fact. The PTSD isn't going anywhere, my depression is getting worse. In layman's terms a nervous breakdown. I'm exhausted trying to cope. I confided in a friend I ran in to and she said no not you, you're always so happy. I'm obviously good at putting on a face. I can feel myself slipping backwards and I've worked hard to get where I am,but now it seems like it was not worth it. The memories and flashbacks are endless. I rarely watch TV because of triggers. Sometimes I just feel like screaming and tearing my hair out. I cry a lot. I have a daughter and adult grandsons nearby and a daughter and grandsons interstate. I dont even want to see them. I only go to see my psych on a regular basis its a struggle to even do that but I know I need it. I just don't know what else to do. This forum allows me to just say it, thank you for listening.",Living57,Community Member,21-01-2021,PTSD and trauma,24,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/nervous-breakdown-ptsd-memories/td-p/526457
PTSD-355,HOW TO STOP OBSESSIVE THOUGHTS ABOUT AN EX ( TOXIC LOVE SYNDROME),"Hey guys I hope everyone is doing well. So I hate to ask for help and hate the situation I’m in but I can’t keep going on like this. I currently have a beautiful girlfriend who is the best thing that has ever happened to me but I still have daily thoughts about my ex. She ended the relationship with me abruptly and I never got closure. I hate myself and my mind for it but I often find myself comparing the 2 and feel because I still have these thoughts about my ex partner that I can’t love my current partner completely. I have Bipolar Disorder, ADD and manic depression and often find these invasive thoughts debilitating. I can’t seem to find a way to stop having these intrusive thoughts and have been stuck on a hamster wheel for the past 2 years. I love my current partner with all my heart and wish my ex the best but it seems that I almost have an obsession with my ex. I have read about love addiction withdrawal but wouldn’t know the first thing about implementing steps to break this obsessive thought chain. If anyone would be able to help that would be greatly appreciated. I understand it’s a tricky situation but I will do anything I can to keep my current partner as I love her dearly and she is what’s best for me and my future. Thank you guys so much.",Jesse Y,Community Member,31-01-2023,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-to-stop-obsessive-thoughts-about-an-ex-toxic-love-syndrome/td-p/558042
PTSD-356,Childhood PTSD,"So I suffered sexual abuse when I was little, I always went numb and was never able to dob him to protect my other fam members... Through my teenager years I tried to see psychs to talk about my anxiety and depression but I was never brave enough to tell them what the real root of it was ... I just let it be and then found thr man of my life who was the complete opposite of the perpetrators. He was fun, a bit crazy, adventurous etc. We had so much fun together and worked through life together until he had a back injury with work and stopped working for the last 4 years...I started having these feelings of being disgusted, angry, numb, I got so distant I can't even answer and look him in eye...I feel like I am back at 15 years old on that place with the perpetrators and I feel like I lost interest in life. I cannot deal with these similarities that bring me back to those nightmares...I am not too aure what to do....I can't get pass it even when he does try do something to move.forward I am stuck on these feelings. I don't take anything for depression but I am in a deep whole right now and cannot feel any love or happiness in life...The only thing that keeps me going is being a responsible mum so I will always stick to survival mode to give them what they deserve...I am not too sure why I am even posting but I can't talk to anyone about this and it's killing me....",Globetrotter,Community Member,28-01-2023,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/childhood-ptsd/td-p/557811
PTSD-357,My Story,"I am in my early 40s, trans man FTM and I want to share something very personal about me, regarding the effects I am suffering in my adulthood, as a result of childhood sexual abuse. I have only ever been able to disclose this to my current and previous psychologist and my ex-wife. Why? Because of the shame, and guilt I feel inside me, and to speak openly about it, is almost unbearable. The effects that I am now suffering, started surfacing about 5 years ago, and I have been suffering in silence for about 1 year now. I was exposed to numerous types of traumatic events throughout my childhood, including sexual abuse and I have been seeking professional help for more than 20 years and have gone undiagnosed until about 3 years ago. My mental health conditions include, C-PTSD, Dissociative Disorder, Sensory Issues (touch), major Anxiety and Depression. When the effects started to surface, I was in absolute shock and extremely confused. I felt ashamed and this prevented me from being able to share what was happening to me, with anyone, including my treating psychologist. I will disclose with you now the effects that surfaced for me; I was finding myself being aroused at the thought of my sexual abuse, I could not believe that I was turned on by the sexual abuse I endured throughout my childhood. How is this possible? I didn't know what to do but I had to do something to make sense of what was happening to me. This lead me to begin an extensive search online, and I am talking about months and months of research. Every google search kept coming up empty. The only effects ever mentioned would be repeated over and over, for example, PTSD, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, self-harm, high-risk behaviours and many more but no where did it mention, being aroused or turned on at the thought of being sexually abused as a child. During my last psychology session, I disclosed more in-depth details about what was happening to me, that I am in distress, and that I have had enough. I also spoke about 2 books that I had read, 1 I had personally found and it's by a female author who remains anonymous and it was her story of childhood sexual abuse and the long-term effects; the other was recommended to me, and it's about a study of 40 women who had suffered childhood sexual abuse and my psychologist had never heard of it. I'm not the only suffering in silence, and I want to change that and help people like me. The worst, is where the research lead me.",Timeless,Community Member,26-01-2023,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-story/td-p/557709
PTSD-358,Trauma + Self Care,"Hello,I am wondering if anyone has any experience with having a chronic illness / trauma. I have been diagnosed with endometriosis and secondary pelvic pain disorder; my pain flares up when my mental health is down or I am triggered by something from my past. I am really struggling to allow myself time to heal and cannot stop being cruel to myself; keep telling myself I am a failure or a sook. I was raised to never be allowed sick days, whenever I complained about my cramps as a girl I was told to toughen up, I was also not allowed to have time off unless I was ""bleeding profusely or throwing up"" which I think plays a significant factor in my guilt and shame.

PTSD-359,Family Cancer,A recap of the past few years: - Mum was diagnosed with stage 3 lymphoma. - Grandma was diagnosed with lymphoma. - Grandpa was diagnosed with bowel cancer and skin cancer. - Mums uncle was diagnosed with bowel and oesophagus cancer and passed. - My great uncle is starting chemo.- My cousin woke up paralysed from the shoulders down and spent 3/4 of the year in hospital. It feels like 2-3 years of hell.. the consistent diagnosis. The hospital trips. The waiting for medical tests. Not knowing the outcome.. I am exhausted.. whenever things settle something else seems to happen. When I think we are finally safe and everything is okay it isn't.. so I can't relax. I am getting angry over every little thing at the moment. I hate feeling tired all the time.. and/or angry over dumb things. I don't know what to do any more.

PTSD-360,I feel like everything I do to try and take control of this just slaps me in the face.,"There's been too many things happen, but atm it's that I wanted to get a tattoo. I always thought I could never get one. I dont know what changed, I think I am still desperately trying to take control of my body. If I blur my eyes, I still think a tattoo is cool. Its just not what I wanted. Why did I even think I had to agree to something I dont like? I wanted to trust her cos shes the artist. I felt pushed to go with this as the best option, rather than redrawing, or even just leaving (she had my deposit). Thinking I should just go with it is not a good way to make such a permanent decision Looking at other tattoos - these ones have faces that arent as big and detailed as what she did. And that's what I wanted. Im so upset. How did i go thru so much therapy, so much learning to assert boundaries and forget all of it in the blink of an eye? Not just the SA, but a guy also pretended to be there for me through court, when rly he was just faking it to get what he wnte. It broke me further, made me feel really exposed adn used and all over again made me hate looking at my body if he didnt even want me and made me expose myself for fake friends. He latched onto so many things that were getting me through the pandemic, including Zelda.Getting it was trying to reclaim my interests too. I havent been able to play it all year because it reminds me of him, even tho I wanted to go back to it in 2022. I know its cute, just not what I wanted. I wanted him to have an angsty expression (ALL my refs did. I hate the heart. It doesn't feel me at ALL. I hate the bottom bit the most. Why did that even need to be there? I wanted something simple, that bit feels unecesary. If she's goi g to copy something, why not go for one of the pics I sent? Instead she copied something completely different instead of making her own design of him. I tried to ask without the heart. She said he had to be contained in something due to the size. After that I got too afraid to ask for more changes, the way she justified felt like she would have reasons for everything. idk what to do anymore. I was trying to own it, have something cool on my body. It didnt work.",plasticinehouse,Community Member,08-01-2023,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-feel-like-everything-i-do-to-try-and-take-control-of-this-just/td-p/556462

PTSD-362,Feeling dead inside today,"I'm a single mum (secondary school teacher) and carer for an 18 yr old autistic daughter and 87 yr old mother. I'm generally a glass half full type of person but days like this are so disappointing.I had given everyone prior notice it was going to be a stinking hot day and I wasn't going to leave the house. At 7 my daughter jumped on my bed wanting her daily drive to Maccas (over an hours round trip). i pointed out it was not in the plan but she retorted it was still early and hadnt got hot yet. By the time I was dressed, had breakfast and watered the garden it was 8am. Mum said she fancied walking down the street for breakfast and would I pick her up so I said if she goes now I could pick her up on my way home from maccas but she said she wasn't dressed yet. I commented it would be too hot later and she was upset. When I got back mum was insistent I fix the backdoor or the dog would escape. By the time I had finished this my daughter who is changing medications was very heightened and demanded another trip to Maccas because she was ""Hangry"". I compromised and said I would take her for a quick local ride but she continued to get even more heightened on the drive and almost killed us both grabbing the steering wheel and pulling my head below the dash by my hair as I was driving home because I refused to take her to Maccas again. on getting home what followed was 2 hours of threats and hysterics in my face and pinning me down so I couldnt get away from her because she wasnt getting her way. Eventually she calmed down after I gave her $50 I dont have for an online game. Then mum wanted to know what time I was taking her to the wine bar. I explained we were not going because it was too hot. She expressed her disappointment then started giving me jobs to water the garden. I explained it was to hot to lug the hoses around at 3pm and offered to do it later. To do it properly it will take hours. So in between all these demands I just sit there, smoke cigarettes and eat junk just waiting for my next assignment.",lilykitten,Community Member,14-01-2023,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/feeling-dead-inside-today/td-p/556879
PTSD-363,How do I believe in myself?,"My name is Nat, I'm 29 years old and up until this last year, my entire life has been a constant repetition of trauma and abuse.I have seen my mum overdose on heroin more times than I can count, I've visited her in hospital when she went on a binge so much that she almost lost her legs, her kidney function, her life. When she drank it was different, it was violent. She's abused me, my sister, strangers passing us by, I've seen her try to kill herself in front of us, the list goes on.I've had to undress her from homemade diapers and bathe her because she didn't want to get up to go to the toilet anymore, taken her to court appointments for when she's attacked people in streets and more recently spent two years by her side when she was in a psych ward from drug induced psychosis after trying to kill her neighbours. I would call her doctors on my lunch break to work out her treatment and rehab plans, visit her every weekend and clean out her house so she had a real home to come back to and within 6 months she started drinking and doing drugs. It broke me and I knew it was time to take space from her so I could focus on giving myself the same love, care and effort I was giving her.To add to the list of traumas, I've been drugged and raped twice and both times were away with friends, they knew what happened when they found me but I couldn't bring myself to say it out loud, none of them wanted to address it and ruin their holiday so we acted like it never happened.I feel like everything has worn me down so much that I don't have anything left to give in this life. I try to practice mindfulness, awareness and gratitude. I do affirmations, meditate and have gone to therapy when I can afford it but whenever I do anything good for my self I can feel this deep seeded belief that things won't work out for me and I am always walking around with this sense of doom and insecurity. I can't go anywhere or do anything when I'm alone, I completely shut off and dissociate watching days go by and thinking nothing of it.

PTSD-365,I think I've realized why I have such a hard time with friends and relationships,"For a long time now I've had a lot of trouble with relationships, whether that be with friends, family, romantic partners, or whatever else. I never really knew why this was the case, but after a bit of thinking the other day, I think I know why this is the case, or at least part of the reason it's the case.As a kid I had 3 best friends (all at different points in time), I never really had big friend groups, I would just have 1 main friend that I put all of my time and effort into. I realized that all 3 ended badly and quite suddenly, all for stupid reasons.With the first, one day we were playing the N64 and I accidentally spilled a drink, which spilled onto some of his Pokemon cards and ruined them. When he saw this, he started screaming and crying and said ""I hate you, I never want to see you again"" and at that point I was crying and just waited for my Mum to pick me up. I never saw him again. He was my best friend for years, and we fell out over a dumb accident.My next best friend pretty much threw me under the bus. One day, my friend's older brother came home early from work, and saw that his xbox controller joysticks had been chewed up. I wasn't me, it was all my friend, but he immediately threw me under the bus and blamed me for doing it. His older brother then started yelling at me and scared the shit out of me, and that traumatized me, so I never saw that friend again after that either (not that I wanted to, you never throw your friends under the bus).With my third best friend, one day we had a disagreement, I won't say what about because I am already nearing the character limit, but it was a stupid disagreement and we stopped hanging out after that.Anyways,This is why I think I don't even bother with relationships now. As a child I was conditioned to think that all relationships would inevitably end for little to no reason, so ""what's the point in putting any effort into them at all?"". I lost 3 best friends that I put my heart and soul into, all over trivial things. My parents also divorced when I was quite young, and my older brother had a new girlfriend pretty much every other month (so I never even bothered to get to know any of them). Both of those things probably just further cemented that mindset into me. Anyways, I'm not looking to get any advice out of this post really, I just wanted to speak my mind.",44Max44,Community Member,16-12-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-think-i-ve-realized-why-i-have-such-a-hard-time-with-friends/td-p/554721
PTSD-366,Not sure what to think of my father,"Little S/H warning Honestly my father has hit my in the past but I only remember 2 times he’s done it he once kicked my in the leg just for looking for some swimmers and the other time he punched my in the stomach so hard I passed out. He frequently yells insults at me and belittling me for random things sometimes and I don’t understand why. Like if a door accidentally slams shut I starts to panic thinking he’s going to yell at me again because he doesn't like slamming doors but when he’s angry at me he yells at me then after he finishes he slams the door behind him and it makes me shake a little. Another time he knew I s/h and one day I made him made for some reason that day but I started looking for something I don’t know what but he was yelling at me before I was looking for something and he yells and insult at me that made me tear up a little and I started to walk away he then screamed “Yeah go f!@#ing S/H” Well something around those lines but then after he apologised saying he shouldn’t have said that and that he was sorry but I just nodded and said it’s fine when really I never forgave him because h encouraged my s/h issue and didn’t get me the help I needed. He even tells me to control my anger when he’s the one with the anger problem. I always get so scared that sometimes when I see him coming towards me I think he’s gonna yell at me like I did something wrong. I find that he’s probably called me all the names in the book. Sometimes he jokes about me being fat, Chubby when I’m reality I don’t look that way and it really makes me feel bad. My mum isn’t that bad she hasn’t called me any mean name she just yells but it’s not as bad as my dads.",Frisk,Community Member,01-01-2023,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/not-sure-what-to-think-of-my-father/td-p/555915

PTSD-370,Looking Over My Shoulder,"Hi,I trace my change back to 2011, I was in Christchurch New Zealand during the major Feb quake that took 185 lives and left the city in ruins. I was working at home when it struck, both my son and wife were in the Christchurch CBD. I was in shock as I picked myself up off the floor ( Not sure how I ended up there ). I remember jumping in the car and heading into the city, with no power for traffic lights, and big aftershocks causing the road to snake in front of me. I was numb and scared, I could see as I got closer to the city the destruction and smoke rising. I got lucky and got my son on the mobile and arranged a spot for pickup ( Not knowing if that was possible ).I did pick up my wife her building was very damaged and she had some bruises, we headed into the CBD for our son, driving through none existent roads and bridges that we had no idea if they were safe. We ended up parking 4 or 5 blocks out of the CBD and walked barefoot due to the liquefaction, we found my son in the crowd. That was the first part of my personal mission, save my family, now get them home ( This took 4 hours enduring many aftershock quakes ). I have a very clear memory while sitting in traffic looking over and seeing a woman with 2 young children in her car, her eyes were like saucers, and I had never seen that much fear ever it really upset me at the time. Fast forward a few years and I was forever looking over my shoulder, what was out to get me, catastrophizing all parts of my life. I had a short fuse, I thought everyone was out to get me. It's a very exhausting way to live, I did get medication and time did heal but the need to look over my shoulder is a hard thing to conquer, I am lucky to have a great wife to help me step back. I watched the 10 year remembrance on TV, it really got the emotions of the day flowing, its the sounds of the sirens that sets me off. That night I had a vivid dream that ended up with me sprawled on the floor after in my sleep I threw myself under a table so I thought. I have been in Australia for a few years now and fresh start has helped, but the mood swings and old habits still rear their head and this week is one of those times.

PTSD-373,Overcoming fear,"I feel I’m now in a recovery phase from complex trauma but I still struggle with fear that comes up in nearly all situations. Multiple instances of abuse in childhood and adulthood taught me that the world is not safe. I have come a long way, but still get overwhelmed by fear at times. I am starting to build healthier relationships with people I can genuinely trust. In the past it was nearly impossible for me to know who is safe and who isn’t. This is getting clearer for me in that my capacity to sense a safe, warm, empathic, balanced person from someone who is potentially unsafe or abusive is becoming more attuned and intuitively present. I’m now trying to ease myself back into the workforce but this in itself can activate a lot of fears. I’d love to hear from others who have transitioned from a collapsed trauma state into a more functional human being where fear is on the back burner, something that might still present itself but no longer overrides your whole being. What were your processes in getting there? I know deeply caring for the child part of myself that was injured is a key factor and this process is under way but still in development. Fear was so much a normal state for most of my life, I was like a fish in a bowl of water, not really aware of the medium I was swimming around in. It’s like I didn’t even register for a long time that fear and terror governed pretty much my whole being. I have particular safe places in nature that are consistent places of safety for me. I also feel very safe with animals, even ones other people are scared of. I’m really calm meeting a poisonous snake on a walk trail but can still be really frightened of people. I co-regulate way more easily with animals too. I’d be interested to hear other people’s stories of trauma recovery and what worked for them on their healing journey, especially where fear was embedded in childhood onwards. How did you feel more consistently safe? Feel like I’m gradually getting there but still feel very fragile at times.",Eagle Ray,Valued Contributor,21-12-2022,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/overcoming-fear/td-p/555114

PTSD-375,"Coping with past sexual assault, emotional neglect as a child, think I have a porn addiction","Hi, new to beyond blue. Not sure where else to turn to. Some events in my life lately have made me realise some things that happened to me as a child and as a teenager that are deeply affecting my now in my late twenties. I am so ashamed of this but if I am honest with myself I believe I may have an addiction to viewing pornography. I believe it to be an addiction because it has gone on for years, and I want to stop and can’t. I tell myself I have it under control, but continue despite not even wanting to do it anymore. I think it is linked to the sexual assault I experienced at the hands of a stranger and other compounding events in my life.. idk. I guess I just hope that someone sees this and responds so I can know maybe I’m not alone? Or the only one with this problem. I know in some ways porn can be normal and actually okay, but it doesn’t feel normal or healthy when I really pull it apart and analyse it for myself. I can’t bring myself to talk about it but I really want help for it, so maybe this is a good place to start. I feel so ashamed of it and like everyone will look at me differently. I feel so alone in my life right now. I want to have a healthy mindset, healthy coping mechanisms with my pain and my trauma. I want to not feel so much shame around this. It’s kind of like, well the rape is something that happened to me, but the porn thing is my choice and my actions and it’s dirty and not okay. The way that I have been raised and the people that surround me don’t talk about sex let alone porn or anything along those lines, so how could I even get started with porn myself? I know that’s what they will wonder if anyone found out and I know I will be looked at differently. idk if anyone can help me understand why I might be having this problem, if it is or isn’t linked to my assault and idk just where I could start in getting help. I do have a therapist but I don’t feel comfortable talking about this and asking for help with it. But I need help. I want to stop. I want to be normal. I want to feel normal.",OrangeBeam,Community Member,03-03-2021,PTSD and trauma,12,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/coping-with-past-sexual-assault-emotional-neglect-as-a-child/td-p/510884
PTSD-376,Dissociation,"Hi all, I am having a lot of trouble with dissociation at the moment, it’s chronic and is leading to frequent panic attacks. I am currently going through court (not my decision) and things have been extremely stressful with that and my daughters have now been allocated lawyers also, but I can’t find any info on the children’s lawyer they have been allocated and I haven’t had great experiences with lawyers or registrars through the family court system so I was really hoping I’d be able to find some info on their lawyer just to help alleviate some of their anxiety about it all, and I think not being able to find any info on their lawyer at all is causing severe stress for me which is leading to chronic dissociation and panic attacks. I have a therapist I see once a week but my apts are on fridays and I’m feeling like I’m really struggling in that time between so I’m wondering if anyone else suffers dissociation along with their panic/ anxiety?",Anzee,Community Member,12-12-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/dissociation/td-p/554458

I hate myself and feel so ashamed....I can't help but feel like this is what is holding me back. Stopping me from learning to live rather than just existing. How do I do it?

PTSD-378,Guilt after trauma,"Hi All I experienced sexual abuse as a 5 and 6 yo. At the time I was obviously not able to understand what and why this was happening to me. I twisted it all around in my immature mind and thought it was my fault, perhaps I had been naughty or bad or something. I also (for reasons I don’t understand) thought that if I had been a girl, this would not have been happening to me, so it was my fault for being a boy. Even though I realised years later that I was a victim the guilt lodged on my subconscious or unconscious mind and is still there undiminished. The combination of this guilt, DID and PTSD, have left me with very low self esteem and a subconscious drive to punish myself physically, mentally and in other ways. Are there others with guilt from childhood abuse and how do you handle it?",DIDbloke,Community Member,11-12-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/guilt-after-trauma/td-p/554373
PTSD-379,I don't think I'll ever recover,"I experienced a wide variety of sexual and emotional abuse as a child and teenager. My sexual abuse occured between the ages of 12-17 and I believe it fundamentally broke something in me. I'm seeing someone, and I stayed over at their place, and I woke up to them cuddling me. I had a breakdown right then and there. I haven't had sex since I was 17, with my abuser, and still to this day the idea of it scares and disgusts me. I want to make my gf happy, and I know she wants to do this stuff, but I don't know how to overcome this. It really just makes me hate myself, I'm afraid, she asked if I'm a virgin and that's why I'm nervous/afraid. This stuff is too difficult to talk about and I don't think anyone believes me when I do, so I said I couldn't explain and she wouldn't believe me, which was bad on my part. Either way, I'm hopeless. 24 year old male and I start shaking if someone puts their hand on my leg.

PTSD-380,Dating a girl with PTSD,"Hi everyone, I’ve currently been in a long distance relationship (250km’s) with a girl for the last 4 months who’s a paramedic and has had an extremely difficult year. Both of her parents died within 2 months of each other at the start of the year and because of her job and a few other things she was on compo when we met (diagnosed with PTSD) Everything was going great in our relationship, we fell deeply in love, would text each other constantly through the day and night, chat on the phone when we could and spend time with each other at every opportunity but in the last 2 or 3 weeks she has really pulled away from me, I’ve tried talking to her about it and she says that she does this when her PTSD/anxiety is really bad, she pulls away from loved ones and isolates. I really want to be there for her but the distance and withdrawal makes it really hard.she does text me every day and we chat on the phone about 2 or 3 times a week but I just don’t know what to do.any advice would be greatly appreciated as I truly love this girl with all my heart and it’s killing me that she is going through this without me.she is seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist and a GP about it but is there anything I can do to help her?thanks in advance.",Horse18,Community Member,21-11-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/dating-a-girl-with-ptsd/td-p/552922

I've reached a crisis point in regards to my ptsd and despite what people are telling me, I'm still getting worse and worse. I keep on trying to find anything that can help me work through my triggers but I can't. There's no group meetings, no controlled environments, nothing over than just telling a person that this thing happened and that ""you're making improvements"" which, I'm not, I still can't tell people no and can't tell people what I think without fear of violent physical or verbal retaliation.

PTSD-383,sexual assault trauma & advise,"Hey everyone! At the start of this year I flew back to my country town for a week before my next uni semester, to stay with one of my old high school friends. My ex boyfriend was one of his roommates, but we were on good terms & keen to catch up. On the last night I blacked out due to an OD at some point when my ex & I were talking. I don't remember a lot but I remember enough to know that I was molested. I hate myself for not doing anything or going to the hospital or police straight away, but I just shut down completely and wanted to pretend it didn't happen. I know I need to seek professional help, but when I spoke to my psych about it she told me that I was responsible for putting myself in that situation. Though I logically don't agree with her, emotionally I haven't been as strong. I keep thinking I'm alright and I can move on but I feel so much guilt and shame and disgust in myself. My current boyfriend knows and it took a lot to stop him from going after my ex. I've started to lose close friends because of the fallout of the assault. My ex is a very influential and charismatic guy in my home town, and he's been busy damaging my reputation back home, in order to save his. There's no evidence to go to the police. I knew in the morning that it wasn't an option considering the serious conservative corruption in my town - no rape claims are ever investigated. I just would really appreciate some advice on how I can emotionally heal from this. It's effecting me in ways I could never imagine. I'm not sure how to explain all this but I'm definitely just not feeling great in myself to a pretty concerning extent. My boyfriend has been really incredible during this and so supportive & understanding - so please know he's done everything right! I had been dealing with drug addiction issues for a while at that point and if I had just not taken it so far that night I could have fought him off. Thank you for those who read this & reply :))",Leona_Maree,Community Member,22-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sexual-assault-trauma-advise/td-p/442326
PTSD-384,Obsessive thoughts about trauma: Over 10 years of severe abuse from a parent,"Hi all, new here to the forum. Over the past couple of months, I've had memories resurfacing about physical, sexual and emotional trauma that I experienced from my father for over 10 years while growing up. He had substance abuse problems and untreated mental illness which influenced the situation, as well. Now I'm at a place where I'm basically thinking about the memories all the time. There are so many things that I am feeling and trying to piece together. I am also trying to make sense of why these things happened - what frame of mind he was in and such. These obsessive and intrusive memories are basically starting to take over my life, specifically influencing my focus with work and school. And it is all very isolating...I don't think anyone in my life would understand what happened or what I am going through now (nor should I expect them to). No one in my family knows what happened. I've told my partner and a couple of friends that I've been through abuse but haven't gone into much detail, basically for fear of overwhelming them. I've talked with a counselor a couple times but didn't find it completely helpful as it focused more about logistics of taking care of myself in general - I normally have a healthy lifestyle so that's not what I'm struggling with, it's the obsessive thoughts. And for reference, I've been on meds for bipolar for a while and have meds to spot treat anxiety, which generally work well. But these symptoms have been worse lately, as the ptsd has been worse. Normally I wouldn't feel the need to talk about these things, but lately the trauma has been taking up most of my thoughts and attention. It can be difficult to not feel able to express what I'm really thinking and feeling to the people in my life. I have tried to spend time sitting with these thoughts to process and feel. Obviously there is a lot that happened and my mind is trying to make sense of it all. But I can't just sit and think about it all of the time. My coping lately has basically just been to distract myself. As soon as I stop focusing on something, then the traumatic memories tend to come back. Just looking to see if anyone has similar experiences with obsessive/intrusive Ptsd thoughts. What do you do to handle them? Do you talk about your trauma with the people in your life?

PTSD-385,Frequent Dreams about the older man who tried to take advantage of me when I was 15/16,"Hello there, A bit of a background story - when I was 15 or 16 years of age my family and I befriended a much older man, at our volunteer work. Over a matter of months and a couple of years him and I grew enormously close. He was 68 years of age at the time and we both got along 'so well' because we were both passionate about 1960s and 1970s music. At first, it was just a friendship. Although, as time progressed, he started grooming me. I grew up in quite an emotionally unavailable household. I am now estranged from my psychologically abusive Mother. And he built that trust with my parents, as he built a 'friendship' with all of us. I was starved from affection, protection, love and security.. when I was younger. I felt very ignored at times and I felt like my feelings/emotions did not matter. So, I began to really enjoy the attention and affection he gave me. He would call me pet names. He would say he loved me- I love you. And eventually he created a secret email address, that his Wife wasn't aware of, so we could privately communicate with each other. He would pick me up from school and while no sexual relations did occur.. he and I became quite close, physically and emotionally. He would constantly tell me how beautiful I was. And I thought he was charming and I liked the attention and 'love'. Realizing this now, I am trying to come to terms that THIS MAN was exploiting me at such a vulnerable and impressionable age. I am getting nightmares still, at 20 years old now. It's deeply traumatic and upsetting. Luckily, I am safe now and nothing like this is happening to me anymore. It is just still affecting me. And I avoid going back to the location of the volunteer work because it brings back some traumatic memories of what happened when I was much younger. I wanted and yearned for protection, love and genuine friendship. ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS EXPLOIT ME! Luckily, when I was almost 17 I CUT ALL CONTACT WITH HIM. Blocking his phone number and email addresses. I started to realize that it wasn't a healthy connection. And now I am COMPLETELY NO contact with him, thankfully. I DETEST HIM. I AM SO ANGRY THAT HE WAS GROOMING ME. I HAVE SO MUCH ETERNALISED FRUSTRATION AND SADNESS. It's too much sometimes.

PTSD-386,When I should be enjoying my life its full of things I want to forget,"Ive struggled since Rememberance Day, I tried to remember the people, but my mind kept drifting back to my nightmare, its now three years on and fight as I might I can't stop remembering, I feel asif I'm cracked and shattered inside and out and can't be fixed. At my age I had thought life would be wonderful, so nice, anything but the nightmare I endure on a daily basis. Three years on and I still lay in bed, wishing I could do anything but think, wishing and hoping for a night without flashbacks and nightmares, wishing I could 'get over it' or 'move on' as so many people tell me I should.

And anger and frustration leads to more tears, and all I want to do is stop the thinking, stop the crying and have a night of sleep, just one night.But its a small victory I'm here at all, and that will have to do, as i keep trying to deal with the night terrors and the constant daily reminders and the feeling I will never ever get peace of mind.",Living57,Community Member,14-11-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/when-i-should-be-enjoying-my-life-its-full-of-things-i-want-to/td-p/552362

PTSD-388,Stop Locking Kids Up,"I don’t know if we can discuss this issue here but, I absolutely do not feel I can discuss this on any other platform but here. I have at least 2 male relatives who I know were incarcerated as juveniles in the 1970-1980’s. Petty theft. One I know stole a bicycle and was sent to jail in his mid-teens. Following the 4 Corners program last night, it has been playing over and over in my head, how this awful experience changed his life forever. I feel sick to the stomach about it. The saying that ‘he wasn’t the same’ when he came out is so true. He never spoke about it in specifics, not even to his parents. But we all knew that something awful was done to him. He never returned to school, was unemployed for quite some time, never married and has never left his parent’s home. He is close to 60 now and still lives with his mother. I will add that he didn’t re-offend. He wasn’t a criminal. He wasn’t an awful person. He was quite shy and quiet when we were kids. He was just a normal boy. Made an awful decision and has paid for it his entire life. That’s the thing with Trauma. Once experienced, it stays forever. It does affect your life. It changes it forever. It changes you forever. And other peoples Trauma affects you too, forever. I did feel like throwing stuff at the television last night. I wanted to scream at the television. The affect it had on me, was physical pain.

PTSD-396,PTSD from work boss,"I started a new job in February 2022, in a role that I had the potential of completely loving and making a career out of. However, my direct manager is hostile, angry and at times, vicious. They refuse to speak to me in person unless it is a direct powerplay to them, being that they will only speak to me if the news/information reflects badly on me and there are other people present to hear it. If I am in a room (eg: staff kitchen/ photocopier room) on my own and they walk in, they will immediately turn around and walk out again. I have NEVER received positive feedback, only 'constructive criticism' or just 'this is wrong'. I feel so unwelcome in this role and in the company. Last week I had (unexpected) surgery, and was told by my manager that I was expected to be in the office the next day. When I arrived, I was told that I shouldn't be there and to leave. I am starting to have panic attacks about my role. They claim they want consistency with reports, schedules and the like, so I copy the layout and content of the previous report/schedule - then it comes back with amendments and edits that are completely different. I cannot send an email to anyone, inside or outside the company, without sending it to them first for edits. I am now on anxiety medication and sleeping tablets - a new development since starting here. I know I play a part in all this and it isn't 100% all them. I have developed a fear of coming into work everyday, I cry in the car on the way in of a morning, and when I get home I just sit and feel numb. I feel so useless. I know I am intelligent to do this job, and can do it well. However the panic I feel from their aggression and hostility is crippling. Their direct manager is aware of it, and has pulled them up on it a few times, but the behaviour just becomes more covert and discreet for a while. I'm looking for a new job, however I no longer feel capable of being 'a good employee'. I spoke to the Employee Assistance Program company and was told the conversation was confidential. Two days later I got a phonecall from HR stating that I am to utilise the Employee Assistance Program, then it has to be on my own time, followed by an email HR sent that CC'd in my manager about it.

PTSD-398,Hate being at “home”,"I’ve never done anything like this but here goes nothing. I have childhood trauma that I have been working through over the last almost 3 years. Unfortunately I’m a full time uni student still living in the same house with the same people with no other options at the moment. After being away from this house for the last two weeks, coming back has been the biggest spiral I’ve ever gone through. The intrusive thoughts are getting louder and all of my tools I usually use to cope are just not working. I just want to pack my things and drive away, never looking back. I’m at such a loss because I don’t have any other accommodation options, I can’t even afford to feed myself this fortnight. I’m exhausted from not being able to sleep here and I just don’t know what to do…",fireswan,Community Member,26-10-2022,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/hate-being-at-home/td-p/550710
PTSD-399,PTSD and my partner,"Hi everyone, I’m here to ask for advice and help and some points of view on my situation I am currently in with my partner. We have been in a relationship since April and we fell in love the right way and it was and is still beautiful in my eyes. We have had some tragedy’s along the way her father passed away after a long term illness he succumbed to in July. So clearly this has added to her problems revolving ptsd. She is a childhood ptsd trauma sufferer and I knew of this early on but I did not know much about it until the last month as it’s starting to affect our relationship. I first noticed that communication was not happening and I questioned this with no answer and I have to say that is hard to deal with when you don’t understand. I was and have been polite and caring in regards to asking what is happening, as when things are amazing and all of a sudden go like that you think that the relationship is all of a sudden in trouble and you are standing there wondering why as nothing has really happened. Over the last month this has gotten worse and she asked for space in which I was not really around her a lot in that time so I honoured and respected and I’d this. She came to me eventually and it was lovely to reconnect again, things seemed great again. But now things seemed to have gotten worse, she is saying she only likes her me time and it was heartbreaking to hear she, then spoke with me on the phone and said we just need to slow things down a bit and I honoured her wishes again. I hardly sent texts just occasionally to say goodnight and hope your day was good nothing else in between. She would do the same, I noticed if I was busy and didn’t text that she would randomly text and say she loves me. This is all so very confusing for me and the worst was last night, I have noticed a decline in my own mental health in which I have seemed out help with anxiety I’m going through now and this situation is making it worse especially when this is happening with the person I love and loves me. Yesterday she text me to ask for help to put together some furniture and asked me to bring her some food she felt like so I’ did as I love and care for her very much and wanted to see her I hadn’t seen her since Tuesday night so it was 4 days and I missed her a lot I didn’t say this though in case she thinks I’m needy in which case I’m not.",Toby1977,Community Member,02-10-2022,PTSD and trauma,22,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-and-my-partner/td-p/548574
PTSD-400,Where do I get advice about trauma support? Trigger warning,"Hi,I am new to this forum and not sure if this is the right place to add a bit about my long past childhood experience. I am doing research as to what level of punishment is acceptable. I have been attending a 12 step MH peer support group (Grow) weekly for about 14 years which has been really beneficial for so many issues but my long past childhood experience of being punished (not sure what for) keeps coming up in my mind and I guess I am thinking it must affect my life day to day. I have never spoken about this before to anyone. I am now 68 and keep having thoughts of long ago when my father used to use a cane when punishing me for something. I think this was how he was disciplined. It didn’t happen often and my father was like any other mostly. However I keep remembering one of the last times I was about 12. I don’t know what I did but I remember counting the welts on my body from the cane after, there were 52. I remember this because it is the number of weeks in the year. Many welts would have been because the cane might hit you in more than one place for each stroke so the number is coincidental. I do remember that he stopped only because the cane split. I remember after thinking that I should go to the police but I was too ashamed. I wonder if this has been a factor in my depression and low self worth etc throughout my life. I have spoken to the Blueknot help line and basically the Counsellor just gave me a list of Trauma trained Counsellors. There are so many different kinds of therapies that it is quite hard to know whether I would benefit and I imagine the cost would be substantial to follow through with any one of them. Is the answer just finding someone to spill your guts to, seeing a psychologist for the suggested 20-30 sessions or something else? Am I just letting my thoughts run away with themselves or is there a reason to seek help at this time in my life and importantly if so what sort?Kind regards Michael H",Michael G H,Community Member,26-10-2022,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/where-do-i-get-advice-about-trauma-support-trigger-warning/td-p/550636
PTSD-401,Stuck,"Hi, my two daughters and I have left their dad a few times now, but this time around I felt like I really didn’t have much choice to leave as I was being threatened by services if I didn’t leave. We spent 4 months in 8 different crisis properties and refuge spread out across the state. We experienced some awful things during that time, including further abuse somewhere we were meant to feel safest. Anyways a court ruled it wasn’t sustainable for us to continue moving around, so we got the house back and their dad had to leave. But he just continues to find ways to control where and how we live without even having contact with us. He made it so he owns everything we have and we can’t escape him. We have been homeless on more than one occasion so I’m too scared to even just cut our losses with the house and walk away with nothing because I can’t go back to having nowhere to live and living out of suitcases, always on the move. But even with a full no contact IVO he still has that control over us and I feel like I’m just going to end up going back to him because it’s more predictable than being controlled by a far. I have no idea what his next plans are to sabotage us and he’s always two steps ahead, so I am in constant fear waiting for the next thing he’s going to throw us. He has moved on (likely only a couple of weeks after we left, whilst telling me how much he loved us and wanted us back etc etc) and I have been talking to someone new recently but I’m so scared that if he found out we’d all be in danger. So I feel like he just continues on with his life, no responsibility for the kids (which is a good thing and what’s safest) he sees who and does what he wants but at the same time still holds so much power and control over me/ us. I want to be able to move forward but as well as being so scared he won’t be able to accept that, I just don’t feel like I can risk that homelessness. Both main times we left I have applied for rental after rental and in different areas and have been turned down by every one. I just feel like I’m so trapped under his control still while he’s out there free to live his life. All of the support workers including the police have suggested because of the severity, I should make criminal charges against him but I still defended him and his behaviour to every one I’ve worked with because I do still love him and he is the father of my children but he just continues to screw me over any chance he gets, but I know I’m stuck with him.",Anzee,Community Member,17-04-2022,PTSD and trauma,94,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/stuck/td-p/20026
PTSD-402,Real event OCD,"Hi Guys, I have suffered OCD for the last couple years starting from HODC to RODC and now i think i am experiencing what is called Real event OCD. Anyway is took me around a year to get over my HODC and then my ROCD left when i me and my ex broke up. I guess it seems my OCD keeps jumping around and it is very frustrating. Anyway, i guess i am seeking reassurance which is obviously not what an OCD person should do but i have recently started taking medication and am feeling better so far. My real event OCD for some reason makes me feel guilty over past events with the opposite sex, especially 2 events in particular. My mind convinces me i am a rapist and a bad person and obviously the last thing i want is to be that so it causes me immense anxiety at times. Anyway, the first event dates back to when i was 17 years old around 4 years ago now... I was at a party intoxicated. The second occasion was a couple years later so 2 years from now. I guess these 2 events make me feel like a rapist in a way and convince me that i am not a good person. I know this is my ocd but its so hard to not seek reasurance. Anyway i never really thought about these incidents to much until my ocd started clinging onto them making me feel guilty.

Just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart, I have this girl everything I had but she couldn’t reciprocate, initially it was done via text message which was even more devastating I said at least talk to me on the phone. Did for an hour and I was composed the first half an hour but I broke in the last half an hour. I was proud I got up and still went to work today as I was crying each time I awoke last night Riddled with so much anxiety and emotions all over the place from this, sadly again I know it can’t be helped but she didn’t she d a single tear I know it’s because of her ptsd but doesn’t make it any easier, I don’t understand how someone can say they love you a few days ago and go to that it’s it over",Toby1977,Community Member,25-10-2022,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/relationship-ended-ptsd-finished-it/td-p/550559

PTSD-405,Physical Abuse? (potential tw),"I need help trying to work something out. I have been quite unwell lately and since being discharged from an inpatient facility to an outpatient program, I have been trying to unravel some things from my past. Quite a few times during my childhood I was hit as punishment after doing something 'naughty'. I can't remember what those things were. Probably talking back or things like that. I know that they were decent wacks on my lower body that made me yell out and often cry myself to sleep but I don't think they left significant injuries apart from red marks as well as feeling fear and shame. I used to think this was a normal experience but after talking to others as an adult it appears that isn't necessarily the case. I am trying to work out the invisible line between punishment and abuse. I don't want to offend others that have experience terrible abuse during their lives, I am simply trying to unravel my story. I have had lifelong low self esteem and self harm tendencies and wonder if these stem from a need to 'punish' myself.

PTSD-406,Trauma and imagination,"Every few months I try to reread or relisten to The Body Keeps the Score. I always feel like there is something that stands out to me that explains how I act or feel every time I go through it. I was described as a vividly imaginative child, though I know creative is not an unusual descriptor for children. I spent every bit of my time, including time that was meant to be given to other things like classes, writing. I still have a shelf of those books that I kept from my childhood, including a broken leather file holder that I was 'gifted' by a teacher in the 3rd grade, which contained most of my loose writings up until the end of primary school. Something changed however. As time went on, I could see in my writing when certain traumatic events took place. Their imagination slowed, and became reflective, analogical, or metaphorical for the events I experienced. This became even more apparent as I entered my teenage years where my abuse worsened and traumas stacked on. This is going somewhere I promise. In the book I mentioned, the author relates an encounter where he asks traumatized veterans to engage in an imaginative exercise. Most of them lead the exercise in a direction of their trauma. However, there was a smaller population (the author deemed to be more deeply traumatized) that refused or could not to engage with the stimuli, stating that it was meaningless or that they could not think of anything. The author concluded from this that trauma impacted imagination, first restricting it in regards to trauma, then finally smothering it completely. I related deeply to both these described groups. I cannot be creative, and if I can it is extraordinarily limited and shaped only by my trauma. I was wondering if anyone else had similar experiences.",Echtis,Community Member,21-10-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trauma-and-imagination/td-p/550216

PTSD-408,Covert Narcissist,I dated for 2yrs and hardly saw him. He said it was work and kids. But I found out it was because he was seeing other women. I confronted him the excuse was that he knows he treats me bad and he was bad at balancing things. Thats what he said when told him he was court out. I never agreed for us to see other people i put boundaries in place at the beginning. Throughout these never was respectful to one. I was completely loyal. In the relationship he would not let me go to his house except for the beginning of the relationship. He made excuses saying his kids didn't like me. So I was doing the right thing trying to be understanding in giving space. And then he would say I could stay but then make up a excuse. I didnt understand what's going on. I confronted him about having a proper relationship he wasn't giving. I said it wasnt a serious relationship. He then would tell me I was being disgusting in what I said but didn't say anything that was. He also told me I had a mental condition because I got upset. He would hid things and i would find them in places didn't put. He would say things out of the blue like I have a spair for when we brake up. It turned out to be true. He said he tried to have someone younger but no one would have him. Other comments. He played the victim all the time. Have gone no contact. And he made me out the be the crazy bad one. I just feel so stupid for staying and believing he loved me. I am left feeling ashamed. He said that why didn't I leave earlier. That just made me feel worse because he was so manipulating and I stayed sending me messages and saying all the right things. It's hard to tell all the things that he did. Its as though the light has drained from me. I don't trust myself for another relationship. I stopped sleeping with him mounth ago. At least that's one thing. But left feeling like a complete fool.

PTSD-411,worried for bro,"Hi, 2015 my mama, myself and my two older twin bros moved to Australia from Russia better life. I wont use his real name here, so I will call him Twin 2, has suffered for many years with very bad mental health. Both he and I were abused as kids by an old friend of our mama. I don't remember the abuse very well as I was only a toddler, but Twin 2 was 8 years and has been very hurt by it for his life. He was diagnosed with PTSD, depression and BPD in around 2013 after a involuntary hospital stay from trying to take his life & self harm. He has very close bond with his bro (Twin 1) and for the most part they are inseparable. We all get along well, maybe we are not as close with our mama as most seem, but she is there and does try to help. She doesn't speak english well so a Rus/Aus community that we are apart of helps her out.This year has been very hard as w/ the war we have worried for our extended family living in Russia, and all of this has not helped with my big bros mental health. These past months he started to harm himself again and has gotten even more clingy than he was before. He is always very scared of losing us and always accuses us of trying to abandon him. He says he don't blame us if we do, but that he can't handle the thought and that he will end his life. We did see a therapist with headspace some years ago, but because he is 25, they no longer provide him with support. We have tried as much as we can to look after him, but it is hard on Twin 1's mental health with the constant fear that when he goes to work that Twin 2 might hurt himself, as neither of us can watch him all the time. He has never had a jobvdue to his health. He spends his days laying around smoking, drinking, but he does try to help out around the house when he can. When he was put in hospital in 2013 he came out more scared then when he went in, so he is very scared and wary of talking to drs about his problems as he worry he will be admitted again. We think here in Australia that the mental system must be better than it is back home, but he is still very scared. We want him to get better and become a functioning Australian as we are very grateful to live here and there are so many more opportunities for him, but he can't leave the house without having a panic attack. Last year we adopted a kitty cat for him and she has helped him, especially for when Twin 1 isn't home to be with him, but we just need to see more progress. help is appreciated and thankyou.",kitsuwn,Community Member,03-10-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/worried-for-bro/td-p/548698
PTSD-412,My partner was disowned from his family because he chose to be with me,"My partner was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness for context. To summarizewe met online and became a couple. His father spied on his phone and monitored and archived our conversations without us knowing. (He was 18 at the time.) His dad took away all of his devices, constantly guilt tripped him saying he was going against Jehovah and their religion (this was because I was a Jehovah’s Witness. His father screamed and lectured him for hours. (This happened a lot.)In the end he wasn’t even allowed to leave the house anymore. He had no access to the internet or literally anything. He sat in his room staring at the wall all day barely eating or drinking.After a while his parents gave him an ultimatum. It was either stay with them and the religion or leave to stay with the worldly person and get disowned. He already made up his mind but every time he told them he would just be told “we know you will make the right decision. Think about it some more.”after a couple of months he escaped through his window in the middle of the night. He had bought another phone in secret and packed some spare clothes, then caught a plane to my state where we met in person for the first time.for two years after that he lived at my family home struggling significantly with the trauma. His father would message and call him nearly every day with more guilt tripping which kept the trauma fresh in his mind. The religion he was in taught him to believe that if he leaves the religion he was going to “die to Armageddon and that people in the outside world would prey on him like vultures.” He still believed in those teachings so he had many many panic attacks, break downs and severe dissociation periods. I was 17 at the time, still in high-school and this was my first relationship. I didn’t know how to help him at all. it was like he was an empty shell of a person. it’s now two years later since he left and he has healed so much. He is himself again and has goals in life. He still has a long way to go but he’s motivated and on the right track. he’s got his own place, a job and is in university. But recently things have been really hard. His parents are coming up here to find where he lives to see him. He is scared and is going back to his same mindset from before.

PTSD-414,EDMR,"Hi, you may have read some of my story. If you haven’t, here’s the gist, I had a traumatic medical episode a few years ago and engaged with a psychologist for severe health anxiety. After a month, I started having triggers and flashbacks from my childhood abuse and my psychologist referred me to a service that specialised in sexual abuse but after a few sessions they said they couldn’t work with me as I was being retraumatised in my relationship and wasn’t safe. I was in deep denial about my abusive relationship as we had been together a long time and share two kids. After a while I was finally convinced to contact a DV service and after leaving for a second time late last year I have pretty much been in trauma or crisis mode. My ex has taken me to court also which I have struggled with so much as at times I’ve felt like I was living the trauma all over again. I had an amazing friend who supported me through all of it but I pushed her away because I felt like I was too much of a burden on her, I have a DV worker but we hardly ever talk, I have a supportive family services worker, but I often feel like I use her too much too and that I’m a burden so will withdraw from her support regularly. I have a supportive therapist, but because I’ve been pushing people away, I’ve managed to go pretty deep back into my denial bubble so I don’t want to face or accept the trauma I’ve been through as I feel like it puts me back into crisis, but my therapist has been encouraging me to do EMDR with me for a while now and feels it will be helpful with my PTSD and flashbacks but I just feel too scared to do it. She’s tried it with me a couple of times, the latest been last week, and because I can’t find a safe place in my internal or external life making any kind of trauma work very difficult, she has consulted other professionals in trauma and EMDR work to get some tips on how to work with me when the trauma is still so distressing for me. She was going through one of the techniques she’d had recommended to her in our last session and we got about 10 seconds into the activity and I just freaked out and said I’m not doing this, then hid my face under a pillow on her couch. She tried to talk to me about what I was feeling and encouraging me to try again but I just couldn’t look at her or communicate, it’s like I completely shut down. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me and why I can’t even try one little thing.

PTSD-415,The Slightest Trigger,"Lots of people are triggered by various things. I have an attitude about them, like this: Triggers happen, like tax, unavoidable. Usually, they are fleeting. They can be either predictable or unpredictable. You might have a mix. I think, if I am going to be triggered by something, surely I will see it coming. I know some things I might read, or some tv shows, movies, some songs, & certain noises. I might make a list, except that list seems to change daily. For example, some days I could watch Law & Order - SVU, other days it gets to me, striking me hard enough to double me up and have me crying. Tonight, it was the smallest thing, a word, 'Twinkle' used in a completely unrelated context, playing the fun little game we have here on BB. I had written 'Star' and Quirkywords had written 'Twinkle', In response, I thought, I can't see the stars anymore. Wish I could, wish I might, because when I was young and having an overnight visit with my friend next door, her father came into the room. Shocked, I froze & looked out the window, saw a single bright star and tried to imagine myself being where it was. until he fell asleep . Now because I don't know what I would do if I needed to detach myself like that again, I can sometimes get to feeling very upset. I don't know why tonight? Just my response to the word, and wishing I could see a star, any star twinkle, brought it back home to me, I can't, it is 'gone' , as I wrote in that thread. Tonight, well this morning, I am annoyed, I'd like to say, ""NO"" and push this all aside. I get angry at having these old emotions, & memories move through me, feeling like they might settle in for a longer stay...I am tired, I need sleep, I worry I won't. stop this now. So, post this thread, whether anyone answers or not. I need to think things through a bit and writing is my best way to do this. I hope, I'm reaching someone else, and what I say is useful. Some people welcome trigger warnings. I don't, mostly because it would be impossible to have a trigger warning on nearly everything. I also understand, if I am triggered by something, it is an area needing more attention & more work. I'm not finished with the memories, thoughts or feelings triggered. I take them as a challenge. I wonder how others deal with the triggers? Do you actively avoid them, or like me, take it as a part of life to be faced? How do you respond to the thoughts, feelings & memories, which have been triggered? mmMekitty",mmMekitty,Valued Contributor,04-10-2021,PTSD and trauma,9,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/the-slightest-trigger/td-p/2714
PTSD-416,Seems to be a never ending story,"Hi, I don’t know where to turn to, then last night found this… Anyway my story started from a young girl who witnessed terrible domestic violence, left home ended up with the wrong crowd, which in turn put me on the wrong road. Ended up getting my life together. Had 3 beautiful kids. My mother would constantly stick her nose in my life, from telling me to have an abortion saying that I had too many children. She got into my daughters brain basically saying that I was a bad mother. My partner ended up being a loser. So I decided to leave with my 2 boys to another state. My daughter wanted to stay with mother. Until she finished her hsc.So life was going well, until I met a man who turned my life upside down. He physically & mentally abused me. My mother instead of coming up to help me, brainwashed the children to come and stay with her. I fell pregnant to this nasty man. The police told me that he had done this to so many other women. So I felt trapped in this situation. Long story short I ended up having him locked up for 6 months. I came back to my mothers house. Was working and everything was fine. When the time came for him to be released. I became so terrified. I left my mums home afraid for the safety of my children. I didn’t realise I had PTSD. So badly I was hearing voices. I came back to my mothers home after 6 months. She called the police on me in front of my children for telling her I would do something to her and her phone, as she was following me around the house recording me. She had me committed and I was released with nothing wrong. She threw me out on the street with no where to go. I had nothing and no one. I have got my life together now and told her that I would be getting a place close to the kids school. She told me to f*** off and not come back. She is telling my children nasty things about me. She is not a good guardian and instead of helping us recover from this, she has just caused more emotional drama. To me this is abuse and I consider this worse than the abuse I went through with that man. I don’t see the sense in living anymore. I’m not suicidal, though what’s the point.",Justanotherday,Community Member,18-09-2022,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/seems-to-be-a-never-ending-story/td-p/547326
PTSD-417,Hello,"My life has been a roller-coaster of unfortunate circumstances. I'll focus on the last few months for today. I finally got the courage to leave my ex after over a decade of abuse both mentally and physically. I tried to talking to people about it previously but was brushed off as he came off Nice or quiet in front of others how can someone like that be doing the things I'm saying. He has made it hard every step of the way to leave him. I tried leaving him in the past the first couple times I didn't because he said he would kill himself and then that change to you wouldn't leave me, I'm all you have. Noone loves you ect.

PTSD-420,PTSD or grief?,"On NYE my teenaged son and his best friend went swimming in the river by our property, they were in for less than 5 min when I heard screams of help. Our sons friend was struggling to keep his head above water. They were both screaming help. My husband and I raced down to help, our son tried desperately to drag his friend to shore but started going under himself, he barely made it out, we saw his friend drop like a stone and as soon as we reached the river we jumped in to get him but we couldn't find him in the murky water. We tried so hard. Community members came running. People in boats, kayaks, jet skis, swimmers who had been swimming there all day, everyone searching desperately. Police were called and Police divers tried to find him. They had all the gear and were looking right where he was but he wasn't found until the police boat with sonar arrived the next day. Right where he went down. 7m deep. I just can't comprehend that we were right there and he was right there, we tried so hard and we couldn't find him. We were so close but we couldn't save him. I know it's only been a few days but we've been through loss before including young people in tragic circumstances, but nothing this traumatic. I know grief takes time. I know it's hard. But this is brutal. The waves of devastation at the fact he was an amazing kind wonderful 15 yr old boy with his whole life ahead of him and the thought of what his mother and father and siblings are going through is horrific but that feels like normal grief to me. The fact it could have been my son instead or as well is a gut punch but it feels normal that I should feel that way. I keep having flashbacks. I keep hearing him screaming help. I keep seeing him disappear below the water. I keep feeling the water close around me as I dove in desperately grasping for him and finding nothing but water. I can't sleep. Nightmares wake me constantly. Sometimes from my perspective sometimes from his. This doesn't feel normal. My husband and our son are devastated but seem to be processing it. Our son and another friend took kayaks back to the spot where it happened yesterday to share a quiet moment. My husband went with them. It was a desperately sad moment but they did it and seemed to be the better for it. I couldn't go.

Last night got me thinking of how behind i am in life compared to friends, slow with learning and understanding things most people even younger than me seem to have taken on board. Then this time it struck me that I repeated year 2 due to math learning difficulties. I was never able to pin point how old I was when a brother of mine abused me for his own experimenting. I am starting to wonder if that happened at age 7ish which would line up with learning troubles in school. I've always wanted to understand the reason behind so many issues I struggle with but my Dr or psych has never specifically said that my experience as a child is the thing that contributes to my problems. I would have to be about 7 years and my brother is 2 years older than me, one day he did stuff to me . Although at that time I didn't know what any of it meant and I don't feel traumatised by it now but I wonder if there is underlying affects it had on me.",ElyseH,Community Member,04-09-2022,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/childhood-sexual-abuse/td-p/546041
PTSD-422,What is the difference between CPTSD/PTSD and anxiety?,"I was abandoned in childhood and now I suffer from emotional flashbacks whenever I’m triggered by anything that remotely suggests to me that I’m about to be abandoned by someone I care about. When it’s really bad, I simply can’t function and fall into a type of depression. I avoid relationships altogether (have done so since I was abandoned), and generally find people triggering because of this fear of letting others get close to me. I also know I have social anxiety (have had this since I was very young), and I struggle with focusing and I also worry a lot about the future. I’ve been going to therapy for a while now, and my therapist has mentioned anxiety and attachment trauma, but has never raised CPTSD/PTSD. I’m not sure why, maybe because being told I have CPTSD/PTSD seems more validating to me than just being told I have anxiety, but I’m desperate to know what I actually have. Which brings me to my question - what is the difference between anxiety and CPTSD/PTSD? Does is sound like I have either of these? Or is it possible that all I have is anxiety? I know I should ask my therapist, but I’m very worried about being triggered if he tells me all I have is anxiety. I’m also genuinely curious about the differences because I know these all come under anxiety disorders in the DSM (excluding CPTSD which hasn’t been included).",Moose17,Community Member,06-09-2022,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/what-is-the-difference-between-cptsd-ptsd-and-anxiety/td-p/546254

PTSD-425,I feel like I’m trapped in a cycle I can’t get out of.,"Hi all. I’m currently without housing security, have no car, no license, no money and no support system. I’m 24F and have lived with extreme agoraphobia and subsequently depression since I was 13. I also suffer from C-PTSD, fibromyalgia, OCD and am on the spectrum (just found out recently and my family won’t accept/believe it and think I am just “lazy”. I finally got out of my small town again after having to leave the city due to my mental health being awful. I was living with my best friend and my beautiful cat in a great apartment, and, for the most part, I was happy for the first time in a long time. I still couldn’t work due to my agoraphobia, but I loved being in the city. I felt confident and beautiful, and ready to date. I met a man who what I know know as “lovebombed” me, before I knew it, he had upset some pretty rough people and he manipulated me by telling me that if I didn’t come with him, he wouldn’t speak to me again. I was so scared and confused that I left with him to his home place 12 hours from my own. Within a month he beat me and my father begrudgingly picked me up, believing it to be my own fault. Now I’m living back in my home town, in someone I went to school with’s backyard. I can’t/don’t want to get out of bed. My relationship with my best and only true friend I lived with has fallen apart. I am terrified of everyone and everything. My accomodation situation is becoming toxic, but I have no money to move and start again. I have been in treatment for 10 years, on every medication under the sun, have been in mental health units long and short term with no improvement, had 25 rounds of TMS and 9 rounds of ECT and Centrelink still won’t put me on the Disability Support Pension and have rejected me twice. Apparently I need a $500+ Autism assessment before they can accept it, despite my conglomerate of diagnoses. I’m just another product of the failed system at this point, and I’m worried I’ll become a statistic. I can’t even afford nutritious food for myself, let alone a $500 assess. I want to start a GoFundMe so I can get my assessment and money for a security deposit in a sharehouse but I am just full of shame. The only thing keeping my alive is my kitty.

PTSD-426,"Sexual assault is one of womanhood's darkest, most unreported rites of passage","It happened to me again tonight. I suppose I shouldn't be so surprised it happened - or that I'd be blamed for it. Why was I chosen? Why was I made to feel unsafe in my own body? Scared of my own shadow? We're taught to cover up, get home before dark, watch our drink, re-think that mini-skirt, keys between the knuckles - ritualised surrender to the reality of sexual violence and misogny.I can't walk anywhere now with someone behind me without my heart thundering, my blood rushing to my ears, my mind haunted with flashbacks. I can't tell my man why I'm simultaneously aroused yet ghastly afraid of the very things that make him so attractive to me, of his larger muscle mass, those meaty, square-tipped fingers that could just as easily bestow violence as they did rapture. I can't tell him that I can't associate sex without violence and violence without men.I can't tell him those things because he'll just look at me with some mixture of sympathy and confusion, the one worn by a bystander observing a reality he will never face but understands on a rational level, exists. And sure, men are raped by other men too, and in some ways this serves as a larger humiliation for the male ego, yet the acute vulnerabilities exclusive to women, but absent in men, makes the threat far more proportional and unimposing for the latter. Men will never experience other men the same way women experience men, and in this decoupling, is why discussions of rape culture and patriarchy will always be mediated through the fear of the victimised and the indifference of the invulnerable as she negotiates her worth on his deaf ears. There is no fairness in this. No justice.And though I'm harrowed by my experiences with sexual assault and male indifference to it - I know that when he asks me later tonight if I'm doing okay, it'll send a deluge of shame down my spine for having thought so ill of him, even in generality.

PTSD-427,Dealing with PTSD symptoms for sixteen months now.,"I left an extremely emotionally abusive five year relationship sixteen months ago and I feel like I have done everything I'm supposed to do, in terms of cutting all contact with the abuser and never seeing anything to do with him again, but I am still having regular flashbacks to episodes of abuse, almost constant rumination about everything that happened, often intense feelings of depression and worthlessness, and frequent feelings of disassociation where everything suddenly seems alien and strange. I'm literally never happy. I haven't been happy at all in the past sixteen months. Even though the relationship was highly abusive, it was somehow easier dealing with the intensity of the abuse than it has been dealing with the flashbacks and trying to process everything in retrospect. During the abuse, there is so much adrenaline and you are reacting in the moment, there is seemingly no time to really digest what is happening, and the abuse was almost non-stop for all those years, there was never a moment where I had space to truly reflect or escape the intensity of it, and perhaps that's why I'm still trapped in PTSD sixteen months later. I've recently started therapy as well, but it's honestly been triggering. I avoid most triggers as best I can. More subtle triggers are hard to avoid and can spark a flashback before I know it, but anything directly related to the abuser I try to avoid. I just feel like it's taken over my life. I don't feel free of the abuser. I don't know what I'm doing wrong to not be able to get over it. I've poured myself into my passions, my art, travel, improving myself, but at the same time I'm completely numb when it comes to meeting people -- I can't stand the idea of a new relationship or intimacy with anyone ever again, it just makes me feel terrified and sick. My future feels empty and bleak in that sense. I have zero desire or interest in being with anyone, ever, because I now have a deep distrust of men that I can't shake. I'm so tired of flashbacks, they are so real that it's like time travel, suddenly I'm right back in the moment and it's fresh and I can hear his voice as if he's speaking to me directly again, saying terrible things, and all the intricacies of the abuse, the way I was objectified and used and reduced to nothing.

PTSD-428,Scared of liking someone,"Hi everyone,Recently, I think I've started to develop feelings for a guy that I've met at uni- for reference the two of us have been talking over snap for nearly two weeks now and have hung out once in uni. So far, all I'm seeing from him is green flags, and maybe even some signs that he likes me- he asks me how my day has been, he told me over snap that he thinks I'm really pretty when he was drunk and the next day he confirmed that he does think that, he's told me I have beautiful eyes, and during the day we hung out after class he was really easy to get along with and we joked around a lot. All my friends are saying it sounds like he likes me, but due to my past experiences with guys I'm afraid for a few reasons.My last relationship was nearly four years ago and even though it was only a few months and I was young, I was left with a lot of self-esteem issues- him and a girl who I thought was my friend at the time but actually wasn't were close with each other throughout our relationship and would always say they loved each other, and he facetimed her on one of our dates. He also made a joke about my acne, which at the time was a huge insecurity of mine, and didn't treat me very nicely overall. My other major experience with a guy during high school was with this guy who liked me consistently for four and a half years whom I was friends with, but he could never seem to take no for an answer and would constantly find ways to subtly touch me, be around me and do things which made me uncomfortable- making a photo of the two of us his wallpaper, always staring at me, implying to his dad that we were dating and even going so far as to admit that he used to drive his car past my house sometimes. Because of these past experiences, I'm afraid of a few things. I'm afraid that this guy might not actually like me but is just saying nice things to me because he has some ulterior motive or is trying to play me, because I'm convinced that no guy could ever actually truly like me as a person. I'm also afraid that even if he does like me, he'll either turn out to be an arsehole like the guys who have liked me in the past, or he just likes me for my looks or something- again, because I don't believe a guy could genuinely like me. All my friends are trying to reassure me and I feel so stupid- does anyone have any advice for me, or any kind of input on this situation at all?

PTSD-429,Family trauma and loss,"I grew up in a really conservative home. I never saw my parent's show any form of affection with each other. Im only now realizing the impact it's having on my relationships. I remember the first fight I witnessed between my parents. I saw how horribly my father would treat my mother. He didn't respect her, he didn't care about how his actions hurt her, and us as kids. As a kid I was oblivious to their fall outs. I would see some things, my mum crying and praying in her room. My dad not coming home until very late and sleeping in the garage. I'm now 17 years old and Im only now seeing the damage it's having on me. I'm getting flashbacks of trauma I experienced at age 5, and all the fights they've had. I resent my father now because, he was someone I looked up to from when I was reeeaally young. Like he was a superhero to me. He took care of the family. He worked all night making sure we were fed and had somewhere to sleep. But I just feel like it was all meningless knowing that he didn't want us. It was really easy for him to walk out and start a new life without us and I'm bottling up my true feelings because I have young siblings who have no clue what's going on right now. My cousin says I'm strong. But I don't believe it. I don't. It took 2 years for me to move on from my uncle's death, and now I'm dealing with the void from my father leaving with no explanation. I just think I'm the unluckiest human alive. But what hurts and scares me the most is that, after everything that's my father's done to my mother, the cheating, lying, sneakiness...

PTSD-432,What is this?,"The more I think about the things that happened, the more afraid I feel. Some of it I can deal with, some of it results in confusion as well as fear. I had an accident a few months ago that nearly killed me. It left me with bad injuries that I still haven't recovered from. My spine was compressed so badly I have permanently lost some height. I should mention that I was diagnosed with PTSD before this, nearly two years prior regarding seperate childhood events. Initially, I didn't think I had trauma around the new event. But now I suspect I do. It has become a source of guilt, anxiety and resentment. Before the accident, I had this excited, semi-nervous thrill for what was ahead. I was going to do something challenging, but possible. Now, I get afraid walking up a flight of steps with a backpack on. I can't carry things up staircases either, I have to walk sideways with my back to the rail and both hands gripped to it, with whatever it is slung over my shoulders in a bag. I used to rock climb with friends, but now the idea of it even fills me with that same, excited nervousness I described before. I used to want to go skydiving, but now the idea makes me feel scared just writing it. I'm sure I've developed a new fear of heights. It doesn't make sense, as the stuff on the staircase only vaguely resembles the incident. I know my body can't tell the difference, but I know as time goes on I'll learn of even more things I am irrationally afraid of, just like I did with everything before it. I feel sick and weak. I don't think I have many triggers, but this new one is so absurd, it seems laughable. ""Oh, I'm afraid of stairs."" To be fair, when I think about it my other triggers and fears are pretty comedic too. But then I remember that this is a sign of something very fundamentally broken in my brain and it makes me rather sad.",Echtis,Community Member,20-08-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/what-is-this/td-p/544219

Not from me?! they also requested as to how long I’ve been on medication which the previous medical report already states? is this ok for them to ask me why I have this condition?

PTSD-434,Unbelievable Rage,"Hello. I'll start this off by stating that I have no intent to harm myself or others. This is me just expressing myself. I don't really have anyone to tell this stuff to aside from my psych. For some reason, I snap to the, arguably true idea that I didn't deserve what happened to me. It is an idea that makes me furious. I never asked for this, I never wanted this, and I certainly never wanted to be the person I am now. When I see people being mistreated that anger rises up inside of me again. I want to scream and shout at the person who is acting inhumanely and without empathy. I want to physically injure them, or tell them honestly what I think of them, which is that they would be better off not existing. Instead, I don't do anything, say anything, I'm frozen, as I'm afraid if I do anything reasonable like telling them to leave the person alone, I will let everything out. I am afraid if I confront them, and they touch me, I will snap and attack them or do anything else that I can think of in that moment. But no. I do nothing, and watch another person get bullied or abused by a stranger or an SO or a friend. The guilt hurts almost as much as the rage. That I did nothing, that I let another person treat someone that way when I could have stopped it. Then I remember what I think, that I want to hurt these people in my anger, and I remember how utterly emotionally broken I am. It all just culminates. I don't know what to do with my rage. I am tired of being a victim and watching perpetrators do their thing, ruining more lives action at a time. It is so bad that I cannot do anything except sit down and try not to explode. Anger management doesn't work. The second I acknowledge its existence it consumes me along with grief and I have to try not to break something. I don't know how to deal with this.

Certainly not as “rewarding” and definitely not what I went to uni for.But I’m starting to think that living with PTSD, working in an intense role and juggling other responsibilities is a bit much. My employer is super, super supportive.My issue is that because they are so supportive, I feel like I’m letting them down. I also compare myself to others. They can do it. Why can’t I? I feel like I’m running away. All my mental health training is screaming “this is avoidance!” And yet, if a client came to me with this predicament, I’d support them to explore that it’s okay to slow down.I know the grass isn’t always greener. But working from home sounds idyllic. I’m a very motivated person. I do feel I’d need to make an effort to work from coffee shops on occasion and network for that sense of community. But I can set my own hours, work around my kids, wear my pyjamas as needed.I feel like I’m failing. I am so jealous of people who can do “all the things” without feeling like they need to cry every day from the stress. I have some great friends who are giving a few mixed opinions. Some say I should go for it. Others say it’s a waste of a HECS debt and everything I’ve worked hard for.Has anyone else changed careers as a result of their mental health? I’d love to hear all about it.Thanks in advance.",cady2015,Community Member,07-08-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/career-change/td-p/542709
PTSD-437,EMDR Therapy,"Hi All, Has anyone undergone EMDR therapy and if so can you share your experience? My psychologist has recommended I undertake a course and has said you don’t have to talk about the issues with the therapist.

I’m expressing myself better and wanting more out of life again. So all positive signs and took a lot of work too. But I have a really strong feeling of loneliness and detachment from the world and everyone in it. I’m lonely when I go out when I’m home and I feel unwanted ignored and like I don’t belong. I suppose it’s not a new feeling but I don’t feel like I belong anywhere or even worse that no one wants me anywhere. Im a pretender I work and shop and live but I don’t really feel that I’m valued or that people really don’t like me. Is it self centred or self obsession or that I’m still always watching for danger and I’m on guard still. thanks MC",Mum Chris ,Community Member,26-03-2022,PTSD and trauma,61,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/moving-on-but-feeling-vulnerable/td-p/3575

PTSD-441,Trouble feeling happy,"Hi, I’ve been having trouble feeling happy. I seem to go through very short hopeful periods and then fall in a depressive slump. My trauma started nearly 8 years ago when my son was born premature. I then lost a baby boy at 17 weeks gestation, my first son had 3 neurosurgeries for his brain cyst and shunt inserted at 19 months. My Mil got cancer during this time (who I WAS close to). After my 3rd earthside child was born I felt content. Although my first son was showing some autistic symptoms with seriously long and frequent meltdowns. Then my Mil became controlling and manipulative asking me if I was having se& with her son, that I needed to sell all my investments and put it onto her son’s mortgage, that my son was definitely not autistic, just a spoilt brat! The list goes on for 18months she hounded when no one was around, except the kids. She told my oldest who was 4-5 years old nasty things about me and he became an anxious mess, which why I found out. She told me to make a decision to leave her son or not. She even said nasty things to my Mum about my parenting. Well, my partner didn’t believe his perfect Mum would say these things so I had no one to back me up. I felt suicidal, worthless, no confidence to even get my son assessed for Autism because my mil made me feel like I was paranoid. I called Respect hotline and they told me to be careful because she will escalate. Anyway, I left my partner over 2 years ago. My son was diagnosed with Autism in 2020. I’ve never doubted leaving but I’m so sick of everything being a struggle. My Autistic son won’t go to school more than 2-3 days a week. I’ve tried everything with support from the school as well. I guess I just feel like I’m always treading water and never getting anywhere and it’s tough sitting back watching friends get pools in and get their house extensions done when I’ll probably never be able to afford to do my extension. Feeling so numb and hopeless and really can’t pull myself up anymore. I know this is probably pathetic but I feel like it’s always me missing out while things just flow for my friends. And I’m 43 so I’ve had a bit of life experience to know that this is often happens to me even when I had the right mindset and took opportunities.

PTSD-442,Fear of returning to state where bad memories/people still remain,"Is it normal to fear returning to an entire state (Queensland) due to bad events having happened in that state/location? I know it is probably not logical when factoring the population of a whole state. But just being near the places brings back really bad memories. I am also worrying that it does increase the chances that I will run into the person who harmed me in the past in Qld. I have to go back to the state because I have immediate family there. But I do not feel like it is a safe location anymore. Never returning to Queensland again does not seem like an option for me anymore, otherwise, I would never see some of my own family again. But I feel very sick at knowing bad people live there and I will be in the same location as them. Am I being irrational?

PTSD-443,Fresh trauma from family member’s death,"content warning for mentions of suicide I’ve posted before about something else. I’ve never known anything but trauma. I think I probably experience it in the womb. The past ten years I’ve been doing my best to recover and I have to a certain degree. But my family’s early experiences in life have completely destroyed us. I lost a brother in 2014 to suicide and I lost another early this year. It wasn’t an instant death either. He was pronounced brain dead two days after his admission to hospital. We had to make a lot of tough decisions. My sister had attempted a month earlier and was hospitalised for the night. It’s not uncommon for our family to contact 000 about an attempt multiple times a year. I had to take care of my sister by myself during and after what happened with my brother and not a day went by for over a month that there wasn’t a risk of her attempting again. I had to sleep in her bed most nights just to make sure she was safe. From the time the phone call went through about my brother until a couple weeks after the funeral I was in problem solving and survival mode. I was burnt out and I think I may have suffered more trauma. I’ve always had ptsd episodes, but now I feel like I can tolerate even less than I used to. It’s gotten to the point where if I’m driving a car and someone raises their voice I have to fight the urge to do something drastic. I’m constantly exhausted now and my normal ways of coping usually mean having extended periods away from my family, but I can’t do that anymore due to financial pressure and living with family. I see a psychologist, but the number of sessions are limited and I haven’t seen them for a month. I just wanted to get this off my chest.",Ashii,Community Member,20-07-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/fresh-trauma-from-family-member-s-death/td-p/540713
PTSD-444,"Trauma, Health and Anger","Today has been hard. Since Friday I’ve had a return of physical symptoms I had recur throughout last year - shortness of breath and feeling very unwell. Today I had to cancel an appointment with my employment agency because I was too unwell when I’d been looking forward to discussing my ideas for starting my own business on the NEIS program. I have a cholestatic liver disease and the recent symptoms may be related to lung issues that can occur with that and I’ll probably have to go through more medical testing. But I’ve also been reflecting on the impact of trauma on health and the suppression of anger that can occur when subjected to trauma, especially from a young age. I had repeat instances of verbal and physical abuse which were quite extreme and left me with nowhere to go but to lie on my bed in a frozen state, often beyond the point of being able to cry. I had to internalise aggression shown towards me as there were no other options. Recently I experienced similar abuse following the death of a family member when I was at my most vulnerable. I was too weak to do anything to defend myself. The liver disease I have destroys the bile ducts, and I feel like a process of internalised anger over my lifespan is likely responsible for this autoimmune disease. Bile is produced when we are angry, but in my case the anger didn’t get expression and I feel like it’s caused inner destructive processes to my own body. After the last abusive attack I was in a state of extreme hypervigilance 24/7. One night, unable to sleep, I realised I needed to scream. I screamed into a pillow so I hopefully wouldn’t freak out the neighbours, but after several screams my body started to let go and I actually became sleepy and was able to go to sleep. Can anyone else relate to possible links between trauma, repressed anger and health issues? If so, has anything particular helped? I’m the kind of person who never shows anger. People have said they’ve never seen me angry. But I feel like there must be a load of repressed anger in me that needs expression. I’m in a lot of pain at the moment, physically and emotionally. I feel like my body has really had enough. I actually bought a book online the other day by Gabor Mate called When the Body Says No. I’m looking forward to reading it as it sounds very relevant to my situation and might help. Sorry for such a heavy topic. I just wondered if others can relate and have any ideas on dealing with deeply repressed anger linked to trauma?",Eagle Ray,Valued Contributor,27-06-2022,PTSD and trauma,39,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trauma-health-and-anger/td-p/30745
PTSD-445,My trauma and the latest public dicussions on mask wearing,"When masks first started at the beginning of the pandemic, I was doing my best by wearing one when necessary. It has though, brought to a head some trauma which has been simmering all my life, but have been able to manage it voluntarily, and accepting that I struggle with my face being restricted or closed in. The specific source of the trauma is not certain, however I have new recollections of an incident when I was 3 years old which have surfaced with mask wearing. As the pandemic progressed, my reaction became more and more intense, and at the beginning of 2021 resulted in full blown panic attacks with feinting and unconsciousness. I feinted no less than 9 times last year due to wearing a mask in a public place, with several repeated physical injuries and visits by paramedics and ambulance trips to ED. I have been lucky so far not to hit my head on anything. After all this incident history caught up with the local GP, I have a very strongly worded letter of exemption, which I didn't ask for, but was offered, however this does not give me much consolation, as I live in fear of being socially ostracized and told how selfish I am for not wearing a mask.It has become so severe that the mere confrontation with someone asking me to put a mask on causes me close to a panic attack. I have also been confronted to the point that even an exemption is not accepted.It would seem that I'm very selfish for not being able to wear a mask, and that the latest discussions are inferring that everyone without exception is strongly asked to wear one. A face shield causes me the same distress.I am not anti mask or an anti anything, I've had my latest second booster vaccination, (total 4), I socially distance and avoid going out in public as much as I can, but I'm feeling with the latest discussions that it will be like this for the rest of my life. Mask wearing is now here to stay, even after this pandemic is long gone. Why is it all so black and white? Why are people so judgemental without knowing someone's reasons?My chances of being seriously injured wearing a mask is almost an eventual certainty, but I guess society is willing to see my higher chance of being hurt and the ambulance turning up than me not conforming to the cultural rules. Every time I see the single issued conversation about the importance of masks, I just don't think I can go on facing it.",DeltaJ,Community Member,13-07-2022,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-trauma-and-the-latest-public-dicussions-on-mask-wearing/td-p/539816
PTSD-446,Was I sexually assaulted?,"About 5 years ago, back when me and my now husband started dating an incident occurred. We were kissing and he then started to use his fingers. I pushed his hand away but he kept going. I then layed down while ... I was absolutely lifeless with no enthusiasm for what was going on but he didnt read my reaction until several minutes later. It's so hard because I know this was never his intent. He is such an amazing, loyal, selfless and thoughtful guy and I want to still be with him but the realisation that I may have been sexually assaulted has really been playing on my mind. there's also been a couple of other times where i've said about 10 minutes before bed that i'm not in the mood, and then he will give me a massage (consented) but try and start something. I don't say no right away (maybe a few minutes later or sometimes I give in) but i'm just laying there completely still and paralysed. Just wondering if this is sexual assault or am I reading too much into it?

PTSD-447,Finally some validation,"So, I'll try to keep this succinct and not too long. And please, before you read on, this could be triggering or confronting.Many years ago I was engaged to a man who is a predator. I say 'is' a predator, because he is still, to some degree, acting up. And very recently he has been legally banned from attending certain functions and venues due to his behavior. As in, it has been to court and people have successfully banned him from having access to those who may be vulnerable to his behavior.And I am feeling both elated like I want to laugh, and for some reason, like I also want to cry. It could be tears of relief? Like as though finally people actually BELIEVE he is not safe and are acting accordingly?All I know is that when we were engaged and he was originally charged with what he did, it did IMMENSE and IMMEASURABLE damage to my mental health and I spent YEARS in therapy as a result. He did 12 months jail at the time while I did about three years in 'trauma' and deep distress and lots and lots of therapy. See, I too, was preyed upon when I was little, and when he and I were together he had used every bit of that information about me and what had happened to me, for his own sick desires. He used it so that he could abuse people.Anyway, back to now and I am 'celebrating' because finally there are at least a couple of places I can now go without having to worry about him being there. I am also aware that this is something that will never really leave my mind or my life. There is no 'getting over' it. There is only 'getting on with it' and accepting what happened then .... and living true to the promise I made myself back then; to never ever keep quiet when something needs to be said. I will do whatever I can to protect others and to stop it from happening again, so help me God. No longer is abuse a 'taboo' subject.And yeah, I think that's what it is: it's both a relief for the current actions, and a little bit of sadness for the younger me who had to endure that experience.Anyway, that's all I got for now.

PTSD-449,First Responders cry also,"Hi, I am extremely anxious about posting & not sure if I am in the right area. I feel like I have to get this weight off my chest. i am a first responder & have been for 21years. I have attended so many critical incidents that I was dubbed Dr Death by my colleagues - not a title I want at all. For the past 2-3 yrs I started to shut down & become a stone face emotionless person at work which crept into my personal life. So much so that I was on guard 24/7 (we were smashed into us you’re a police officer 24/7) & having a very difficult time being able to switch off. Gradually I became worse, even tho I’d put on a brave face & help as many ppl as I could. But I didn’t realise it was me that needed help until my bucket over flowed a few months ago. I would be okay to some degree at work but as soon as I hoped into my car to go home, I’d break down for no reason at all. I pushed this aside for a few weeks but I found myself crying at any sad events that were shown on tv, like seeing a child upset for loosing a parent in a movie would trigger me. Even though I knew it was fictional, I just couldn’t handle it. It got to the point that tragic events on the news send me in to a panic attack where I have to get out of the house and just run. I did this many times to the point I’d collapse due to exhaustion. I stopped all interactions with friends & going to family events as I only felt safe at home. I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and depression & I am off work. I was asked if my work made any effort to talk or note events that I attended to, but being a supervisor, I looked after my troops but I wasn’t looked after. I am not blaming anyone but I can’t help but to think if only my supervisors were to record those events, would I be in this mess I am in now? I have some good days but mostly are bad with flashback & the nightmares & crippling. I know I am on a long road to recovery, but none the less I am on that road. I just wished I had of sought help 3 years ago when a mate asked if I was ok as I wasn’t myself anymore. I am trying hard not to blame myself but some resentment is there. So, as a male & as a first responder I am placing my hand up in the air to say I also cry & it’s bloody tough to say it, I need help & I am getting help from my psychiatrist & psychologist. And to be told to just get over it and toughen up by senior management I now know that those words were so wrong & damaging First Responders cry and it’s ok to do so.",Boy_in_blue,Community Member,29-11-2021,PTSD and trauma,15,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/first-responders-cry-also/td-p/26787
PTSD-450,What helped you with trauma recovery?,Hi People So I’ve been diagnosed by two psychologists with trauma related issues. I spent over 12 months with the first one and didn’t feel there was much progress (if anything brining the issue to the surface probably made me go backwards). Ive had four sessions with the new psychologist and there’s definitely a better rapport but I still feel a bit in the dark about how to get some sort of resolution on this (anything would be good). Can I ask if others have had a traumatic event and how they overcame it? I’m not expecting everything to be 100% but I need to feel a lot better than I do now to be able to push on. It really is consuming me. Thanks,Rupes79,Community Member,27-06-2022,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/what-helped-you-with-trauma-recovery/td-p/7642

PTSD-452,Supporting a PTSD partner,"Hi All, I'm hoping this is an appropriate forum to ask for advice from either people with (C)PTSD or partners of people with (C)PTSD. My partner has complex PTSD from childhood and then 8 years as a paramedic. I've been in a relationship with him for just over a year. We have come a long way together as this was his first loving and supportive relationship, and not everything has been smooth sailing as you would expect when one of the partner's has CPTSD. However, we both have respect and care for each other, and we have had many discussions on the complexity of his illness, and I continuously educate myself about my partner's illness and feel I am a supportive partner. There have been many adjustments made to reduce his triggers, including me having my phone with me at all times and the sound on, going to bed together at the same time every night, providing reassurance regularly, and creating new routines and adding structure to every day activities. However, there is one issue that we cannot resolve and that is the one of my dog. My dog is a very gentle 6 year old labradoodle and very well trained; however, my partner is triggered by my dog whenever she gets up to get a drink, go outside, or wants to play, or when my partner comes home and she's excited to see him. I understand that due to his paramedic role and his feeling that he always has to make sure everyone is ok, he can't relax if my dog isn't asleep. My dog has been with my two children and I since a puppy and she is part of the family (this is especially important for my two children to have consistency as we had to leave the family home when I separated from their father) and lives both indoors and outdoors. My partner needs the dog to be outside going forward, in order for him to be able to relax. I completely understand how he feels, however, I didn't get a dog so that she could be outside by herself all day and night, and I think to do so is neglectful. He says he is at breaking point, and I feel like I have to choose between my dog and my partner. I'd be grateful if anyone has found a way to resolve this issue, is any ptsd therapy has helped this issue, or if I am being inconsiderate in my view that the dog is part of the family. P.S. I have put the dog out on numerous occasions when he is not coping or has had a stressful day, but his stress is impacting me and being an empath, I feel guilty to both him and the dog.

PTSD-453,Early Childhood Abuse and Trauma - Trigger Warning,"Hi, I have had recurring thoughts going back to early childhood. I believe all my anxiety and depression stems from abuse suffered very early on. I was enjoying watching something on TV last week and it bought back memories of dancing and playing around in front of the Television. I would have been 3-4 years old. This would have been my daily routine, being home with my Grandmother. She would put on Play School for me. But this one day was different. I just remember being picked up by one arm and being spanked quite hard. It was my Grandfather. He was home from work that day. My dancing and singing in front of the television was unacceptable to him. He carried me to the kitchen and continued to assault me. I think by then I had passed out from sobbing and being assaulted. After this day, I found it very difficult to find joy in singing and dancing. I was terrified that he would hear me. My mother also remembers this incident but I don't recall seeing her that day. As my younger sister was a baby, my mum may have been home too. I am sorry if this brings up any trauma for anyone else, but I seem to start remembering all the awful events and how this has affected me throughout my life and is the cause of my anxiety and depression. If anyone is wondering, I did get a chance to tell my Grandfather what I thought of him. I was only 18, but I let him have it. Called him every miserable thing I could think of. I cut him out of my life after that. I know sometimes this does not help my PTSD but I am stuck in my own head thinking about how this early abusive event affected the rest of my entire life.

PTSD-454,Need help,"I am in my 60s and have struggled with psychological pain, anger, isolation, self loathing, etc all my life. I’ve had a lot of counseling and therapy and medication, but nothing really got anywhere near making a difference. Recently a chance comment led me to realise that I have carried a huge load of toxic stress all my life on account of childhood emotional abuse and neglect. I had never recognised what happened to me as trauma because it wasn’t physical abuse. While the realization of what is actually going on is a massive relief (I am not mad or bad, I am not mysteriously a failure at talk therapy), it does bring another load of anger and despair about why none of the people I turned to for help ever recognised my trauma symptoms, and about all the time I have lost to this pain. After a difficult search I have found a trauma focused therapist but starting this again is slow and I am still struggling to deal with the episodes of extreme anger, fear and sadness that erupt when I am triggered - and I find myself triggered more and more often by more and more things. I am exhausted and frightened. An hour once a week with a new therapist is not helping yet, particularly as I have to tell the whole story all over again just to get to a starting point. I don’t have any effective strategies to get through my days and nights, or to start to calm myself. I’m trying yoga and tapping, more exercise, etc but I’m often left feeling worse afterwards and terrified at the feelings that flood back when the distraction ends. I wonder if anyone else feels or has felt like this, and if anyone has found anything that works.",nexttime,Community Member,17-06-2022,PTSD and trauma,9,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/need-help/td-p/36469
PTSD-455,Coming to terms with trauma from the past,I have had a rough week I have had to come to terms with trauma from my teens. I don't think I have come to terms with it just yet. But I feel that I have started to accept it. For a long time I had denied it. I had also been conscious of over medicalising it. But I don't believe it is medical to call things trauma. It just is what it is. Trauma doesn't need to be medical. I must not invalidate my own experience. I must be compassionate to myself. I must ground my compassion in the reality of my own experience. I can't lie to myself and I can't cherry pick or manipulate the truth. Content/trigger warning: Healing is always always possible. But having an understanding of what the thing is that has caused me grief or trauma in the past is key. I believe I now have. I have heard it said that we only really come to terms with things from the past at a later stage - for me it looks like almost 10 years. I've always been a high functioning person but what I haven't been is high performing. I guess I have answer now - the thing holding me back was never clearly articulated. I booked in to see my psych earlier than i had anticipated since last session. Its a complex beast and I believe the more i work at understanding it the more i will be able to tame it. The sun still rises and it sets just the same. Last week working at the election was interesting because everyone i spoke to there was struggling at some level and had put an end to the things that bought them grief or trouble. I was the same. I must learn to stop comparing myself to those around me now of a similar age or experience level or whatever. We all have our trauma and our history. It's just that some are more capable of hiding it. OR maybe some are fortunate enough to not have it. I mean its life isn't it? It is what it is. Compare myself to who i was.

PTSD-457,Is it PTSD or just anxiety?,"Firstly new here. December 2019 at 34 weeks pregnant I had a car accident which wrote off the car but I survived with baby intact. Hit a tree and rolled. Still don't know how I survived it. Then at 40 weeks got induced after a week at being 3cm. Rough birth. Episy. No epidural, but everything else medicine wise. Suctioned out. Nearly emergency caesarean. Post birth had a haemorrhage and again nearly ended up in an emergency room. Came round ok after an iron infusion. Baby was fine. Went back working at 20ish weeks postpartum. Had issues with driving due to the amount of gum trees around. Did counselling. Worked my way through it and use podcasts as distraction technique. Husband and I are discussing subsequent children now daughter is over 2. Keep getting very anxious about birthing again. Not sure if just anxiety (hx) or if possible repressed issues from birth of daughter. My anxiety is there about baby 2 regarding finances (will be fine), pregnancy itself (had bad morning sickness with no1) and then the birth and after birth. I am so worried that I'm going to bleed again or that I won't be able to conceive again or I'm too old (32) Sorry to be frank but I have found I need to be regarding both these issues. The car accident has meant that I do not drive to from my current home town to my town that I previously resided in for 5.5years. I can't drive past the point I crashed. I get so upset and I need to do breathing techniques when I've tried. Regarding the baby I want to give daughter a sibling but I am terrified of dying or having to be induced again. I'm petrified everything that was an issue the first time! Thanks",Amor90,Community Member,26-06-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/is-it-ptsd-or-just-anxiety/td-p/22392
PTSD-458,Sudden death of an old friend,"Hi, I learnt earlier this week that a childhood friend passed away suddenly last week. I haven’t seen her in over 10 years but I can’t stop thinking about the awful abuse she suffered as a child. I read a tribute to her today. Posted by her parents. These are the same parents who were often physically and violently abusive. I can’t get my head around it or them. The parents had severed ties with her as she didn’t fit their perfect family portrait. But now put on a show of fake love as they prepare to lay her to rest. I wonder if they feel remorse? I remember a time when she missed a week off school. Her parents both assaulted her for coming home late one night. She spent several days in bed recovering. I saw her injuries as they healed, while her parents boasted to mine, that they taught her a harsh lesson. I feared her father, more than I feared my own. I wonder how her trauma may have impacted on her early and sudden death. Her heart just stopped beating. My own heart aches for her. I recall our nights out, going to see live bands. Dancing in night clubs and just being young and carefree. All she wanted, what we all wanted, is to be loved. My heart aches for her one and only son and hope that his father is looking out for him now. She complained endlessly about child birth but she doted on her little boy. I have been suicidal at times as well but this death, her death has me grief stricken. I would reach out to her sister but I am unsure if they had any contact at all recently. The last I heard, she was estranged from her extended family. I don’t know what I want out of this post, except that I need to get this out. My heart is aching. She often told me that I had a wonderful dad compared to hers.",Fiatlux,Community Member,24-06-2022,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sudden-death-of-an-old-friend/td-p/12965

PTSD-460,Fear of returning to work,"Today I approached a place with my resume to ask if they have any volunteer work opportunities. I’ve been out of work for a long time, caring for parents at the end of their lives, trying to study and managing my own health issues. While I was doing the covering letter this morning I could feel myself going into a state of abject terror. I realised how raw and vulnerable I still am following some trauma stuff and that the idea of returning to work even in a voluntary capacity is quite scary. How have others gone with this? Have you experienced something similar? I was proud of myself that I managed to walk into the place, actually speak to them and hand over the resume. The woman there said it would probably be about 3-6 months before they are taking volunteers, but she would put my letter and resume on file. Walking in and leaving the building I was consumed with grief for so many things - the loss of loved ones, the loss of my working life and confidence in recent years and the loss of my health. I’m also scared in that I have a disease that progressively destroys the bile ducts in the liver. There is no cure but a medication that can slow the progression. I feel so vulnerable about choosing the right work as too much stress can progress the disease more rapidly. I’m trying to stay positive and hopeful.

PTSD-462,What has helped you to overcome narcissistic abuse from parents and siblings?,"Hi, I am new to the forum and hope someone has a suggestion for me, because talk therapy has not helped. I have been to various therapists for years and need a specialist or a different approach, although I do not want to take drugs. To make a life story short, i grew up with a flamboyantly narcissistic father - he told me I was nothing more than an extension of himself and i had to be perfect. He was supported by my mother, who told me after each abuse how much he loves me. I used to think she was a victim, like me, but now realise she was an enabler and chose to stay in the marriage for his prestige. I was the golden child who got punished severely if I didn't get perfect grades, etc. À smallest error would be punished by hours of a lecture on how I have ruined my life and often followed by a belt. I was also forced to do things I did not want to do to benefit the family, from getting forcibly baptised as a teenager because grandma wanted it (I was and am an atheist) to being told that I have to marry a foreigner, any foreigner, to get a visa and get the family out of the Soviet bloc (I won a scholarship instead). I was sent away alone at 10 years old to a ""sanatorium"" because I had a sniffly nose, and than again at 11, no mater how much I cried and begged to stay. I have built internal walls, have trouble keeping friends, and my first marriage was to an abusive narcissist. The worst part is that my scapegoat sister, with whom I've had a strong trauma bond, has also abused me. She has the need to control situations, which I can understand, but the side effect is that she lashes out with extreme vengeance if I disagree or even try to draw a boundary. It is usually in a form of vicious letters/emails, but she also ended a lease from under me in the past without giving me much time to find a place to live. No wait, the very worst part is that our father died and the mother recently moved in with my sister, who is now losing her mind completely. She has lashed out at me, apologised, wanted this and that, changed her mind, etc. I have gone through what I can only describe as multiple stages of grief over losing our relationship and recently have not been able to call my mother for a couple of weeks at a time and constantly fantasizing about blocking both of their numbers. I also feel that will never again be able to trust my sister. I am minimising the contact, but need some kind of intervention asap. Any ideas?

PTSD-464,Complex trauma and feeling limited by talk therapy,"Hi, this is my first time posting. I have complex trauma from early life experiences onwards, including emotional and physical abuse. My parents also had complex trauma from their childhoods. For 17 years now I have sought help from talk therapy. The first therapist I saw ended up transgressing boundaries unprofessionally with me and essentially massively re-traumatised me leading to major dissociation and panic attacks. I talked to my GP who agreed the behaviour was wrong and gave me a referral to someone else. This started out ok. However, one particular incident that was another inappropriate (but less serious) boundary transgression triggered me and the situation became untenable and I felt I had to leave for my own well-being. This therapist also talked at me without being present with me, if that makes sense? In more recent years I was back at uni. I saw one of the uni psychologists who was actually very helpful. She had training in somatic experiencing which I’d been learning about at the time, though she didn’t practice it at the uni, but at least could draw on the principles of it with me. This somatic approach was way more helpful for me than top-down approaches like CBT. However, I was limited to 6 sessions per year at the uni and when my enrolment changed I could no longer use the service. This psychologist advised it would be good for me to have ongoing therapy support, especially as I’d just been through significant grief and loss followed by a traumatic incident of abuse that had led to acute PTSD symptoms, compounding the complex PTSD I already had. Since then I’ve tried several therapists but I don’t feel the talk therapy has gotten anywhere, and in some cases has caused further harm. The one person who really helped me did two approaches with me, something called TRE (Trauma Releasing Exercises) and BWRT (Brain Working Recursive Therapy). At the time my body was essentially still lying on the side of the road during the abusive attack, reliving it 24/7. This approaches lifted me right out of that. This therapist was extremely compassionate and emotionally present, which made all the difference. So this largely resolved a single-incident PTSD event, but not the more complex trauma I still struggle with. Have others with complex PTSD failed to be helped much by talk therapy? What things have worked? I’ve given a huge amount of time, energy and money to talk therapy, but feel it’s been very limited help-wise and even harmful.",Eagle Ray,Valued Contributor,04-06-2022,PTSD and trauma,11,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/complex-trauma-and-feeling-limited-by-talk-therapy/td-p/40785
PTSD-465,The aftermath of abuse just doesn't go away.,"It has been about a year since it happened. Although it was months later I truly understood what had happened to me. And I think its only now i confidently call it what it is. Unfortunately that meant I kept my abuser in my life for months and I think I've lost about everything because of it. The thing I really need to get off my chest right now is that my abuser came back to a university club and been elected to the council of it now, and I am also on the council. And I want to resign because I never want to hear her voice again but I don't want to resign to give her power over me again. Even though I functionally am leaving that space anyway, its not like she can do anything with that power. In fact except for have me leave that space. Its probably a bad idea to post to all the admins ""I should not be on a council with my rapist so I resign"" but thats really how I want to do it. A few people in the club know what happened to me, but most of them dont and I guess think she's fine, and it's my word against hers anyway.

PTSD-467,Even Hercules has his Limits,"Hi Everyone, Im new to this but really need some support so decided to give it a go . I am currently going through a huge relapse with my Major Depression Disorder. I haven’t been this bad in about a decade. I’m a single parent to two great kids, both of which don’t have relationships with their fathers & that I am responsible for in all shapes & forms. My kids aren’t young, my son is 16 and my Daughter is 23 ( I had her @ 18) . I’ve put them both through good schools, whilst managing to work full time as a Project Manager. I come from a big family who are supportive but that have also been really critical of me most of my life. I left my sons father 13 years ago due to domestic violence, he was in a responsible profession so a lot of ppl questioned the truth of it . 3 years ago , my son started to realise his sexuality & was brutally bullied which ended up being a major contributor to my son attempting to take his own life. He was hospitalised in the mental health ward . It was & still is a something I have to monitor on a day to day basis but at times I cop the brunt of a down day. Last year I had a massive fight with my dad after he unloaded on me that I had ruined his life because of the stress of the situations that my childrens fathers brought to his life , he also told me I was ... repeatedly ( for which he has apologised for) but it was that relentless @ the time that an ambulance was called bc I actually cldnt speak I lay on my floor feeling like I was having a breakdown. Since then my mental health has declined, but as usual I keep going. I feel like I don’t have a choice . However, after recently going through a breakup I’ve hit a wall. I’m struggling to get out of bed , my anxiety is through the roof , I literally have nothing left to give anyone especially myself. I feel like I’m on auto pilot , I’ve stopped cooking dinner , letting the kids order Uber eats at least 4 nights a week, I’ve gone from being the popular life of the party to not wanting to go anywhere. Over all these years, all I heard was “ ur so strong, you’ll get through it “ or God doesn’t give us more than we can handle “ well I’m sorry but I don’t think God expected me to be Hercules’ .

PTSD-468,Presenting as ok even when you’re not,"I have a tendency to always protect others from what I’m going through. I might have been at home minutes earlier in desperate amounts of emotional pain, but once I’m in a public setting I put on a brave face, say hello to people and will even say I’m going well if people ask. I think a major factor in this is that it wasn’t safe for me to say if I wasn’t ok as a child. Doing so could even lead to being attacked. From about the age of 5 I learned I’m alone in the world and I have to take care of myself. I also became a carer for a parent with mental health issues at this age, so I became a carer rather than someone who received care. I think part of the issue too is that it’s just not a usual thing to drop the fact you have experienced trauma into a conversation, and I don’t like the feeling of burdening others with my troubles. On Monday I have an appointment with an employment agency to try to get back into work. Most likely I will automatically tell them I’m fine, have a very glass-half full, optimistic approach and in no way reveal how desperately I’ve been struggling over the last couple of years particularly. This is me on autopilot. But in reality I’ve been through multiple losses in my life including deaths through illness and suicide. I experienced an instance of volatile abuse from someone known to me following my mum’s death that almost pushed me completely over the edge. I was also just diagnosed at that time with a progressive autoimmune disease with a reduced life expectancy. My fear is that I will go forward pretending I’m fine as always but that that could jeopardise my health and even my life. My health has improved greatly over the past 3 weeks, especially since a dietary change which has led to a great improvement in symptoms. But I fear I may take on too much with work in terms of hours or stress levels that are harmful to me. What I’m wondering is how do others cope having trauma in their history that still affects them? How do you go out into the world and interact with it? Do you pretend everything is “normal” and “fine” even when you are really not ok, or have you found a better way of managing this? It’s like I fear if I say I’m not ok something terrible will happen but if I don’t say I’m not ok I’m extremely alone and not taking care of myself. I even put my brave face on when I’ve been to counselling sessions and essentially protect the counsellor from the worst I’ve been through.

Secondly; I then found myself mourning all those lost years and moments battling and fighting without having the 'right' tools to survive and hold my ground. Needless to say it's been a very overwhelming couple of months and through a mental health plan I've started sessions to attempt to unravel the knot that is the trauma and hopefully get a better understanding of my triggers, strengths etc. Today has been very heavy and I just needed to vent I guess.

PTSD-473,Finding glimmers in PTSD and trauma,"Hi everyone, So I've been reading about glimmers lately and thought it might be useful for other people too. Basically the idea is from Deb Dana (a professional in trauma) that tells us that every single person all of the time is looking for signs of safety and danger. Most of the time, we aren't even aware of it but our system is always keeping an ear and an eye out for things that could be dangerous to us. In trauma and PTSD, we don't have the same baseline of safety- so we're constantly looking for danger more than we need to. Like a door slamming even though it's just the wind. This is why we get jumpy even though we might know that we are ok now. So glimmers- intentionally finding ways to know that we are safe. Some of the ones I can think of and find is cuddling my dog, smelling a vanilla candle and looking at the plants around my house. and the beach; I always feel safe at the beach Is there any you can think of?",romantic_thi3f,Blue Voices Member,22-03-2022,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/finding-glimmers-in-ptsd-and-trauma/td-p/17327
PTSD-474,Working through Trauma - feel overwhelmed,"Hi I am working really hard on overcoming my childhood traumas ( emotional abuse and narcissist parents ) I push my boundaries every week with the support of my therapist, dr and Chinese medicine practitioner so I have great support. I recently decided with advice from my psychologist to approach my sister about an incident in our childhood that has always made me feel ashamed and guilty. I did this and it wasn’t as big of a deal to her as I thought. However i felt brushed aside, gaslighted, ( unintentionally on her part - she’s the golden child I’m the scapegoat) and it’s really effected me negatively. I feel incredibly anxious, I’m overthinking everything, worried I’ve done something worse to her and I’ve forgotten, not sleeping well and barely eating. Now she’s given no indication of this it’s all my own doing. It’s a pattern I have of pushing myself then exhausting myself then questioning and finally defeat. She said she needed some space so I think by opening up to her ( maybe too much at once ) I’ve made her uncomfortable. I feel overwhelmed and think I’ve re-traumatised myself through this process. It’s hard because I want to work on our relationship and we used to be close when we were younger however she’s very much like my father ( narcissist ) and although she’s understanding she doesn’t have the same feelings I do about our childhood and it is almost as though she doesn’t want to remember. I carry a lot of guilt and shame around because of the abuse. Now this waiting to hear from her I feel like I’m in trouble and that something bad is going to happen. I struggle with anticipation anxiety and am terrible with confrontation. This all feels like it’s too much. I’m just wanting some kind words of encouragement. I feel like I can’t open up to get again and I know if I push it she’s going yo just close down like she has done previously. I know I’m the only one to get myself out of this vicious cycle as I put myself here but it feels never ending at the moment.

Although the vet doesn't know what is wrong they have put her on strong painkillers. When she has these she doesn't show pain but sleeps. She is not drinking water and is very out of sorts. I feel it is time to put her out of this misery. The vet wants to do an MRI at a cost of $5000.00. I have spent $1600 at the vet in the last 9 days. I am besides myself as I feel she has had a stroke or has a brain tumour yet the vet keeps stringing me along. At the end of the day I truly believe she is showing all the signs of a poor animal at the end of her life. I am so torn. I barely sleep, I put her on my bed at night and she is often panting, crying in her sleep or having tremors. I am so upset and anxious and I guess I just want someone to make that decision for me. Which I know is not going to happen. I rang my local vet and told them what has been going on (they were not aware as I had to take dear doggy to emergency vet throughout all of this). They were very kind and said to me that if I truly feel it is time to take here there anytime and they will look after her.... I am so scared that if I do this it might be too early? Yet deep down I know something very wrong is going on with her....I am falling apart. I love her so much. She had a terrible life until I rescued her. I hate life. It is so terrible and unfair. I have been crying almost constantly daily. Please someone help.

I am unsure if I have suffered emotional and psychical abuse. i don't feel comfortable saying much about it because I have touched on this topic in the past, but I am feeling like it would explain things a bit better for my life now.

PTSD-481,I have a noisy neighbour who won't allow me to rest or sleep when I'm at home,"I've been in my apartment for 3 years, and was so happy when I moved in. After a few weeks, I heard very loud shouting, swearing, & heavy objects being thrown around upstairs. Due to being positioned in a unit directly below, I heard every single thing. I called the police. Nothing was done. It happened again, and again. I spoke to my landlord, was told to let them know what's happening, after 12 times reporting to the landlord over 3 years, he is no longer shouting or throwing things, but he has changed tactics, and now he invites heaps of his friends over to drink heavily and party, most days and nights. Police are unwilling to pursue the matter. I'm stuck feeling disrespected and denied rest. When he parties there is the loud voices and laughter plus they drag furniture roughly across the floor. I have ear plugs in at night, and try to wind down with music etc but am feeling furious now, and don't know what to do. I am starting to pack my bags, but don't have another place to go to! I am getting tearful and anxious that I can't solve this problem. I am constantly thinking of solutions, and scenarios where I am imagining I will talk to him, reason with him, ask him to be quiet...I have had a friend go with me to talk to him face to face which helped him to quieten down a for a couple of months, but I am unable to keep on going this due to stress levels and extreme fatigue (exhaustion). It's preventing me from studying my course when at home. I go out walking, shopping and all the normal things as well as work, and I get home and feel so upset and hopeless when I can hear him being so noisy and disruptive. I'm 58 and am scared I will be homeless if I can't hold on to this tenancy....because I'm not on a high income, and have no family support to fall back on. I get scary thoughts when I'm alone at nights, that I will run away somewhere. I even think I need to prepare to live on the streets, which would be better than where I'm living now. I know I have no control over this situation, and everything I've done to help myself has failed. I've prayed for help too. I'm too old to keep fighting. But I can't surrender to his harassment and abuse either.

PTSD-482,I feel alien and alone,"I don't know if I was like this before my trauma. I know I didn't have many friends, but I feel like I alienate everyone around me. I am just trying to be more honest about who I am. Usually the first couple of times I meet someone, everything goes well. Then, if I don't mess it up, I sabotage the relationship in textbook avoidant behaviour. I am terrified of women especially, the nicer they are to me, the more distrustful I am. I interpret compassion as predation. I was honest about this fear with a new friend. They... Criticised it. ""Don't say it like that."" They said, in a way as though I had said something deeply bigoted or offensive. I have little to no friends. My best friend moved out into the country to get married, and I haven't seen them since. They do not respond to my offers to visit them. Before that, they did not speak to me for months. I understand that honesty is not always the best approach especially when it comes to making and keeping friends. But I feel as though people are constantly criticising, judging, rejecting and abandoning me when I attempt genuine interactions. I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone. I've had a historically terrible relationship with my parents, which I won't get into. Despite our past, we are closer now, and they are the closest thing I have to friends despite how confused my emotions are for them. I honestly don't believe I am a terrible person. I believe I can be blunt, and edgy, but I don't think anything I'm doing is warranting the way I'm treated. My trauma tells me to run away and hide and that even if things go well they will fall to pieces and hurt me. I'm just rambling now.

PTSD-483,Absent Father,"My mother and father split when I was 1 1/2 years of age. He has re appeared then disappeared 6 times throughout my life. I'm 45. He promises the world and apologies profusely every time. And every time I have forgiven him, except the last time. It's been 20 years since then. He keeps track of me through my step father which is fine. I don't approve but my step father has been there for me since I was 2. I know I should probably forgive him but the hatred runs deep. Will I regret it when he passes? At the moment, no. He is a narcissist, he is very good at being manipulative and plays on people's emotions to get his way.

PTSD-484,Mothers Day Guilt,"Hello, I need some reassurance that I have done the right thing and am not being selfish. My mother has schizophrenia (unmedicated /untreated by choice). I'm almost certain she is a narcissist as well due to her inability to think about the people around her. She was an drug addict for most of my childhood and got clean when I was 11 years old when my baby sister was born. I helped her get clean - babysitting for hours while she went to NA, we moved into a refuge together until a dept of housing place came up and I helped her raise my baby sister until I move out of home at 19. Our relationship deteriorated when I moved out and she only visited me when it was convenient or she needed something; which would usually result in her belittling me, putting me down about my achievements or pressuring me to be better. Fast forward to now, she hooked up with an abusive asshole who uses her financially, physically assaults her and is an addict as well. She has been smoking pot again and I feel it is only a matter of time before she's on the harder stuff again. I told her how I was feeling - heartbroken and extremely worried that she is throwing all her hard work away. I told her I love her but need to protect myself first and cannot be in her life until she gets rid of this guy because I have been having panic attacks and trauma flashbacks. She did not reply or acknowledge but told my sister I am selfish and that I need to let her live her life. So I decided to skip Mothers day this year which is eating me up with guilt. I know that if I saw her all bruised and unwell I'd go down my own mental health spiral. Im a mental health support worker and now I am feeling so so guilty, imagining what I'd do if she was my client, like I should have just toughened up and saw her. I know she's unwell and that she's in DV relationship which is hard to get out of. It's not her fault she is unwell and in this position but also she's not trying change, nor is she even speaking to me. Ugh.

PTSD-489,How do I explain this to my significant other?,"Hi again, I'm a young man who experienced long-term CSA from ages 13-16. A little under 10 years later, a little under a year of therapy for CPTSD, I think I'm doing okay. This post will contain me talking about how my CSA experience has and continues to affect the sexual side of my relationships. I'll be as clinical as possible. I've been seeing somebody on and off for around 3 months. We have been intimate, but not sexual. Last time we saw each other, she initiated foreplay, and asked if I was a virgin as I ""seemed uncomfortable"". I said no, and she just sort of laughed and didn't believe me, said that she'll take care of everything and I shouldn't worry. Soon, everything sort of starts to feel unreal. In hindsight, this is the beginning of a flashback. Everything seems to remind me of my abuser, being completely unable to do anything, and I just lock up and cover my face. At first I try to stop myself from crying, and instead let out a noise she mistakes for a moment. After another few seconds she realises something is wrong when she goes to take my hands to them on her chest and sees my tears. She gets off me and starts asking what's wrong, but I am completely not there. What happens is what she says, as I don't really remember what happened. She gets off me and keeps asking if I'm okay, but I keep saying that I'm real over and over again. She wraps me with a blanket and goes to call her friend who asks if I take drugs (I don't), and that if she thinks something's wrong she should call an ambulance. At this point I walk into the kitchen and try to stand in the fridge at which point she stops me and I sort of come too. She takes me back to bed, and I cry on and off until I fall asleep. I remember it like it is a dream or a really faint memory. She explained things when I woke up and doesn't believe that I don't remember much, and is really upset with me. We are close, but I don't know if now is the tone to cross this bridge. How do I explain it to her? People I've explained my abuse to in the past haven't believed me, even when I've had flashbacks in front of them. I think this is the end of our relationship. I like her, but this is the worst flashback I've ever had.

PTSD-490,2021 - traumatic times that brought out my resilience 2022 - the tiniest of problems have left me mentally under siege. Why?,"My mother, an emotionally difficult and dominant presence in my life,attempted three days after Christmas 2020. She was in hospital in the mental health unit but only stayed there a week and only after I convinced her to try and get help for her mental illness and her harmful drinking. From what she told me, many months later, she spent that week arguing with the staff over things like the TV, the temperature and when she would get her nightly medication before discharging herself and ceasing any further contact with mental health professionals (my step dad backed her on this). On the advice of my therapist, I told her I loved her but I was taking a break from her and my stepdad to work on healing myself (I knew their drinking wasn't going to stop and their drunk abuse been very painful part of my whole life). Three months after I ceased contact mum called me and bluntly told me that my stepdad, who has been in my life since I was 4, died suddenly from a heart attack (he's my only dad). I organised the funeral and saw her once every three weeks to offer support. But over the months things deteriorated - her behaviour became erratic and five weeks ago she created a situation that made me and also her neighbour think she had attempted again. When I finally got a hold of her, seconds away from calling 000, she laughed at my distress before getting angry swearing at me and telling me never to call her. The thing is, last year was the most difficult of my life but I got through it ok - I helped Mum, I did well at work and looked after my young children and stayed in a solid, healthy relationship with my husband. But after this incident with mum this year I find myself obsessed with stupid work things and I'm baffled by it. I feel constantly on edge, like adrenaline is surging through me and I am absolutely convinced that I am screwing up everything at work and I wake up wired at 3 in the morning. I don't trust myself to make decisions at work and I'm worried I'm forgetting things. I can't switch my brain off! My own boss has sympathetically advised me that I should care less and my husband too but I can't stop thinking that next time I'm at work I'm going to screw everything up and humiliate myself.

PTSD-491,Childhood sexual abuse and cheating,"Hello everyone! This is the first time I've ever posted to a forum and I have no idea how I'm expecting it to help. Maybe I just need to vent a little or maybe I like the idea that someone else dealing with trauma will read this and know I'm there with them and I feel what they feel. I was sexually abused by my father when I was about 5 years old - it continued with less severity until I was 17. Abuse comes in a thousand forms. I see a psych regularly and am medicated for ptsd, anxiety and intermittent depression. The worst manifestation of this trauma is my tendency to cheat on my partner. By cheating I mean that I've kissed other people, flirted excessively and touched body parts over clothing. It happens when I drink because I feel desperate for sexual attention - it makes me feel valid and I feel disgusting admitting that the only times I truly enjoy myself at parties is when I'm getting some kind of sexual attention. I'm also terrified of sex. What hilarious irony! I'm not cheating because I'm unhappy in the relationship. I'm cheating because I don't know how to interact with people normally. I have no boundaries and my body doesn't belong to me. My partner is aware of two of three times. I feel sick with guilt and regret for my actions. I'm terrified it's going to happen again and that will be it - I won't be able to forgive myself. My partner won't be able to forgive me.

My mental breakdown was publicized, rumours, slut shaming you name it they post it about me. Also, because we live in a small town I am noticed everywhere and it keeps the pain of rejection alive and strong. I am treated as less than human and it breaks my heart every day I have to get up and face other people's judgment.

Confused about my feelings, confused about my relationships to other people, people that are close to me, confused about the memories that keep popping up out of nowhere. As I am going deeper in the past - I ask myself: If these situations steered the course of my life, impacted on my life so signifcantly to cause me mental and physical issues now - then who am I? I feel like I am playing Jenga with my life. What if I take out a core relationship and everything just falls over? Can I accept that I hate a person I was meant to love? Can I forgive and move on? Can I accept that I love and hate that person? Then there are other people that have caused so much grief in my life and changed my life forever, but it was not their fault. I have moved away physically, but also removed my heart because I cannot bear the pain. I have learnt how to look excited when opening a present, when to laugh if people are laughing, how to mingle in public, but I don't feel it. I can also detach when being sad, change face in an instant. Have I just built a pretty facade? Put the Jenga pieces on top of each other without making sure the foundation is ok? I am going back so far in my past, that I am worried what I may find out about myself. I am worried to start questioning the core relationships I have now - and then what? Are there others here that are working through childhood/young adulthood trauma? How have you coped? Am I over thinking this?

A friend from back home introduced me to her friend who was living here and I met him for a drink and soon were dating. He was different than my usual types- kind, polite, attentive, did everything for me. 6 months later he moved in. I notice at times he would space out/mood would suddenly change. Was often confused and pushed it aside as him being a perfectionist and has a blackbelt in karate. It was during lockdown and were working from home in 1 bedroom apartment did I realise he was depressed and anger issues (would sleep a lot, couldnt focus on work, always on his phone and taking it to toilet) I started feeling uneasy, he has many female friends and one kept messgaing him. The fights started, I threatened to leave and he assaulted me, immediately apologising and alluded to harming himeslef. I was so shocked at this loving man. lockdown ended and he got back to his 'old' self and proposed in November. The abuse continued shortly after and by January he was so far gone I couldnt reach him (his parents had arrived to meet me as international travel opened. The night I was about to send out save the dates, I saw dating advert on his phone and when confronted he blurted it out he has a pornography addiction.

I can’t stop shaking, tears just flow at any moment, and the anxiety is out of control! I want this to end, and even though I have left him, it’s getting worse, and the love I have for him won’t shut off! He called it quits on our marriage and informed me that he wasn’t in love with me anymore and felt like that on and off for about 30 years! He wanted me out of our home as I said to him “I spose you want me to get out as well”, and he said yes, so I did. It was a hard thing to do giving that I love him, but considering his explosions in the past, I really had no choice. It was fear that helped me get out! He has accused me of sleeping with everyone he knows, which I haven’t, and I have been devoted to him since I was almost 15 years old! There is so much to this non story, but I don’t want to divulge too much as I am feeling really stupid, used, and discarded about pretty much everything in life! I don’t know if he is Schizophrenic or has NPD, but his paranoia is over the top! My head just spins out of control and I can’t eat. I can’t think. I can’t go to sleep then when I do I wake numerous times through the night, and sometimes I wake having a panic attack!

Until recently he had only told me, but he’s opened up to another friend, and told me he would like to talk about it more, but doesn’t want people to “feel bad” for him. I don’t know how to navigate talking about this stuff with him. What are some things I should avoid if he discusses it with me? What are some good things to have him talk about/unpack? The last thing I want to do is upset him or push him away from talking about it with me.

PTSD-501,State of the world advice,"I really want to know how everyone copes with the unfairness in the world when all they've had is bad luck or a bad hand. The ongoing inequalities, the financial / social issues / the capitalist society that doesn't cater to people like us. I'm Koori, grew up poor and in social housing, both parents were/are addicts and I was abused physically, emotionally and sexually throughout my childhood. Now that I am out of survival mode and trying to make something of myself I am finding myself so angry at the world around me. I am so bitter about differences in upbringings, where people are at in life (buying houses and having babies), the opportunities people have had and just the love and compassion they have from their family in general. I've tried being happy for them most of my life - How lucky they don't/didn't have to go through that, I can live vicariously through them; but now I can't shake this feeling. Jealousy? Envious? How do I move on from here? I don't want to be this way but I don't see anything changing anytime soon.

PTSD-502,Noisey neighbours and stress,"Recently I had recovered from infection after infection which caused other issues. I couldn't work and was on bed rest. I found myself miserable, depressed and under a lot of stress. Right now I think im more on edge that I feel. I can't get to sleep im ot tired and when I am and can't sleep. On top of that I have noisey neighbours in a townhouse complex, I have complained 4 times about them and they can be outside for hours and hours just talking loudly drinking and swearing, sometime til 2am and sometimes for hours during a weekday.last night I don't know what came over me it's like it wasn't me but they were outside from 1pm till after 10 pm and getting worse. I had enough and I got up slammed open the window and yelled at them. But they started yelling, laughing and swearing back at me. This isn't me and now im more anxious they know who I am and might try to do something. I now can't stop running it through my head and having a conversation with these neighbours in my head where I'm having to justify my action to people who obviously have no regard for other people. I'm worried they'll keep doing it out of spite. I don't think they work. My mental health is not coping well and my job requires me be alert.

PTSD-503,29 years of not dealing with being sexually abused as a child.,"Hi, This is my second thread. I feel like i needed a new one as last night, i felt like there was light but today, that light has gone again. Im not sure how much detail is appropriate here but holding in everything just consumes everything in me. When i was a child, i was abused for around four years by one of our neighbours, im not exactly sure, it doesnt feel like time actually progressed in days and years, more in events. I dont remember a day being a day, i remember and still sometimes measure time in times between memories (f that makes sense to anyone other than me). There were so many times i was attacked, so many things that happened that i remember in clear detail and feel the exact emotions i felt at that exact point in time. I cant go into detail, im pretty sure that a rule here but god i want to let it out. Just so its not in my head. I dont know if it will help but i feel it might. The threats he made, the way he made me feel, from hated to loved and everything in between. Those feelings have never left me. The reason they never have is what follows. He and his family finally moved away, back to India of all places and my dad actually made me come with them to the airport to say goodbye.He even got them maccas on the way! I cant ever remember him getting me maccas ever!!!!! Shortly after this, i was at our other neighbours house, their son was in his mid 20s and was always really nice to me, let me pay his computer as we didn't have one. Talked to me about things i never talked to my family about...He was a friend. One day i told him what had happened, i dont remember how much i told him but i remember his reaction. He asked me if i had told anyone, else. When i said no, he told me good,to never tell anyone then he gave me a hug, then he told me to sit on his bed. I wont say what happened next, you know what im about to say. That went on until i was in grade seven. I know that because we moved and i started grade seven at a new school. Since then, i have lived with this. I want to go into the feelings i have about it, i want to talk about my complete fear of trusting anyone, ever. I want to talk about why i have no friends, why i hurt the one person i have ever loved and lost her and have forced my children to now face a future without me being there like im supposed to be. I want to talk about the dreams and the hopes and the fears, about the want to move on but the fear of that. Im at a cross roads where i dont know what to do.

PTSD-504,Stuck in a trigger. Tips for making it stop,"Sorry if this post isn’t in the correct forum. Long story short I’ve left my home (where I was raised) in busy Sydney for a week to visit my partners family in regional NSW. I’ve felt triggered since being here, I believe it’s from a period my early 20s post break up with a guy from a smaller town like the one that I am currently in. This was 12 years ago but traumatic, I was heartbroken, ended up living alone, isolated, abandoned (and I have childhood abandonment issues), lonely and had nowhere to go as going back to Sydney at the time was a worse option (because my family is out of control) than suffering alone in an unfamiliar place. My issue is.. I cannot shake it off.. I’m in my 30s, have an 18 month old, I’ve tried talking to myself about who and where I am RIGHT NOW but I still feel sick! I am currently also a little sick anyway but I feel mentally sick. I’m looking for some advice or techniques or tools that you’ve used or gotten from a psychologist for getting out of a trigger. Unfortunately most of my triggers make me angry and so I’ve worked on THAT, not this type where I feel SICK. I also find that self guided art therapy works for me so also open to anything a little alternative. thank you!!!!!",dreamer28,Community Member,12-03-2022,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/stuck-in-a-trigger-tips-for-making-it-stop/td-p/242

I am exDefence and now whilst out of Defence manage a team with a significant amount of Defence members.

I’ve already been struggling lately but this event has hit me hard and I don’t even know the person.

PTSD-506,20 Years of Emotional Abuse,"My husband has been emotionally abusing me since three months into our relationship. He and I were both unaware of this for at least the first 7 years of our relationship. Since my second baby was born almost 13 years ago I have tried to leave many times but have never had the strength. Each time I told him I need to leave he would be able to convince me that he has done nothing wrong, that it is all my fault, that I was imagining things, and that all was ok. Each time he found new ways of doing this, including blaming my kids - saying that it is them making me feel mentally unwell. I had post natal depression with my second baby. He never consoled me or understood how hard it was for me! Late 2020 I considered taking my life for the first time and started self-harming. I have had anxiety all my life but this was the first time that I felt so unstable and confused. My psychologist wanted me in hospital but hubby wouldn't let me go. He would do everything he could to convince me that hospital would be bad for me. It was close to Christmas and I had to cook the family meal for his family. Come Dec 27 I wanted to go to hospital, told him that now Christmas is over I can go. He again convinced me not to. I don't know how, but he was so convincing. That afternoon I knew that if I tell him this again he would try to talk me out of it, so I lied. I told him with every ounce of strength in me I was just going for a walk. I then took myself to hospital. Through text I told him I was there. He sent me a stream of angry texts, and I felt bad, but I was in the hospital, and I couldn't leave, and I was safe. Each time he has patronised me, beriddled, controlled me and shot me down in conversation he has always managed to find a way to convince me that I am not good enough, that it is my fault, that he did nothing wrong. Now - 1.25 years after my first stay in hospital I am in hospital again, under the guidance of my psychiatrist after yet another attempt last week. After almost two years of trying, my professionals have finally convinced me to leave, this time I cannot back down, I need to leave this toxic relationship AND I need to protect my children who are also mentally and emotionally damaged by him. I am afraid he will manage to convince me again. I am afraid for the welfare of my children who live with him. I am afraid of what he might do. This is going to make him pretty angry.

PTSD-509,I am back,"Hi, I am starting back on treatment for ComlexPTSD. I thought last year was bad but this year just got worse. I was dealing with a child that was agressive and intimidated and scared me so much. My husband wanted him out of the house but I refused to do it. A mum doesn't turn her back on her children. Well I couldn't fix it and the Police got involved and it was so bad so so bad. I feel like I failed everyone and now i am dealing with the loss and grief involved with untreated mental illness and my child refused to go to a facility so was locked up in jail and may go to prison for a long time.The sadness got so bad I ended up in hospital and I speak to a counsellor and will see a trauma specialist soon. I wanted to go to emergnecy and just get into hospital for mental health treatment but I work and my husband doesn't want to be left alone. I still might but i am trying to get outpatient care set up so I can get free from this sadness. I have all the classic PTSD triggers, loud noises, intrusive thoughts bad sleep nightmares and physically i am not doing great. I am down a dark invisible hole and people around me can't see it and when i try to explain it i cry and can't talk. That's one of the things that happened to me when the initmidation got very scary i lost my voice i would lan to spewak up and say NO but I just stuttered and fumbled and froze. I can't believe i was ready to leave my husband so I didn't have to face standing up to my son. This is how I feel - I had 1 job and that was to raise a healthy happy child and I failed. I have enrolled in a physical rehab to get some fitness back and I watch funny shows to get my laughter back. My counsellor said yesterday to pick my grief up off my pillow and stick it in a cupboard and shut the door and say not today Grief you can just stay there today I am going to be free of you. She also says he had choices to make and he chose to act that way and to do those things I am really not that great and I am pretending to be OK.

PTSD-512,A decade long trauma,"Hi all. Firstly, I don't know if I have PTSD or something else going on, but for the past decade we have been involved in a traumatic and ongoing family court battle that just never seems to end despite it going in our favour. I won't list everything here, but it has taken a massive toll on me personally, so much so that I can physically feel the stress, if that makes sense. I am constantly waiting for the next nightmare to start - and it usually isn't very long between each nightmare. In other words, I feel like I am on high alert all of the time. It has taken a toll on my relationship, my life and my well-being. Anyway, today I decided enough was enough. I want my life back. I am not sure where to start but it is a big deal for me to even admit that all is not right with me. I am told (alot) that I am strong, and people literally say ""I don't know how you keep going"".

PTSD-513,Nursing and PTSD,"Im now 60 and I loved my career as a RN and Midwife through all the hard times and good times but it all came to a screaming end the evening I got stood down as of immediately and told to leave the hospital and I would be told the reason why the next day. I wasn't told and a week later I was told (that it had been assumed by heresy and conjection )that I had offered euthanasia to a terminally ill patient .I was totally overwhelmed and shocked by this accustion and in hindsight had a cardiac event . Over 6 months of investigation this was found unsubstantiated and I was told I could now go back to work as before. I did return to work with high anxiety but rumours and gossip ran high and I was told I could not say anything ,even that my name had been cleared as I would breach confidentiality regulations set by NSW health. Finally after being victimising and stigmatised by management I went down the workers compensation pathway and to make a long story short after another 2 years and involving Barristers and lawyers I won my case and received a WID payout. I was experiencing PTSD ,anxiety and depression. It was a long haul climbing out of that hole and I was grieving at the same time for the loss of my life as a nurse ,financial insecurity ,isolation from colleagues,feelings of judgement and helplessness and having no control over my life . During this time my pyschologist introduced my to ""tapping"" or EFT( emotional freedom technique )and it has been one of the most useful tools during this time frame .Just google it .Brad Yates utube clips are a good place to start .We can process what happens as much as we like with our frontal lobes but this"" tapping "" works on the amygala and hipocampus the areas in our brain that control fight or fright ..fear . My post today is to say along with mindfulness,staying grounded,journal work and a trauma course (TRTP )tapping has given me huge relief and has helped with improving sleep and decreasing nightmares,inactivating fear responses and increasing self esteem . Other things that have helped are my wonderful husband ,long term loyal friends ,my gorgeous daughter and not giving into the abyss of depression .I have slowly re-engaged with society and am content with gardening ,swimming and seeing beautiful parts of our world .A simple life where I can rest and focus on the journey of recovery is my day to day goal now .",Kayak,Community Member,01-03-2022,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/nursing-and-ptsd/td-p/21583
PTSD-514,Idk if this is SA.,"When I was 5, I started going to school and there was this boy in my class who always tried to hug, kiss me, and also grab me, mostly my arse. Once he tried to grab and kiss me again but I ran away from him so he ran after me and followed me but I hid until the bell rang. I always told him to go away and to stop but he never did. Another time was when I was against a pole sitting down with my friends and he came up to me and put his legs either side of me and started thrusting in my face while he was standing, I pushed him away and told the teacher but he only rlly got a slap on the wrist. He did this I think from when I was like 5/6 - 9, but I don't know if this counts as sexual assault since he didn't really do anything extreme like rape and never actually kissed me (BC I shoved him off me before he ever could). And we were both so young and maybe he didn't know any better. Plus if it was sexual assault then I probably should've hated him but I didn't.

I know there have been a lot of changes in their life but I have no other option but to work.

I’m not actually suicidal, I wouldn’t do it, but I find myself thinking about it regularly. My ex keeps reminding me that the kids wouldn’t have to be in childcare if it weren’t for me choosing to leave the relationship and I can’t help but think about how I have ruined everything for everyone by leaving. The financial stress, the feeling that I am doing everything wrong, and the exhaustion from having to do everything every day has me constantly thinking about giving up and just not being here anymore. I don’t want to tell my therapist because I had been doing so well before starting work and I don’t want to disappoint anyone by admitting how I am feeling.

PTSD-520,Bullying/past trauma,"This isn’t easy for me to talk about, but I thought I’d share it on here to help others in the same situation. High school was the worst time for me. Mainly in years 7-8. I was bullied mainly by one girl (we’ll call her B). At the time I was very quiet and shy which is probably why she targeted me. I just wanted to learn and to fit in at school. She would say things to make me cry and intimidate me. Once she got other girls in my class to gang up on me and bully me. They weren’t usually the mean ones. I guess they did it because of peer pressure I’m not sure. I dreaded going to school because of B. At the time I didn’t know why she targeted me. I thought I was the problem. Looking back on it I know that’s not true and that it was more about her insecurities and not about me. It was like she couldn’t go a day without bullying me. When we all reached senior year B matured and was nicer to me. I’ve since moved on from the experience but I’ll never forget it. At the time I was too scared to ask for help or talk to a teacher. I opened up to my parents about what was happening, which was very hard, and I ended up switching classes, which made things better. I bottled it up for a long time, because I was scared. But I realised it’s not good to handle these things yourself. It’s important to talk to someone you trust and can confide in so the situation can be changed. Being the shy and friendly person I was, I tried being nice to B despite how she was treating me. I thought I could bring out the niceness in her, maybe. It didn’t work. I always see the good in people, and I guess I thought I saw some good in her somewhere, and that she could find it. High school is only a small part of your life. It doesn’t last forever. Although it might seem hard now, things do get better. I hope someone sees this post and can relate to my experience.",shanna_d,Community Member,11-02-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/bullying-past-trauma/td-p/4904
PTSD-521,PTSD Diagnosis..,"Hi everyone, About halfway through last year I started seeing a new psychologist (my 3rd in 3 years). Pretty soon after she diagnosed me with PTSD and I was kind of shocked but also not surprised. I remember telling my parents and laughing at myself because it just seemed so strange to me to have PTSD because I never experienced abuse or neglect or anything like that. What I did experience was a very tumultuous childhood and I guess, seeing as the messiness started so early in my life, I grew accustomed to it, so for me its normal. I suppose that lead me to belittle the impact of my experiences, so I've kind of gaslit myself into believing that I'm ok when I'm really not. Like I will be having flashbacks everyday or so (to different extents), but still forcing myself to function until I completely crumble and wonder what happened. Its not until after I was given the PTSD diagnosis that I kind of allowed myself to be a little more broken if that makes sense. I was a little more vulnerable seeing as I was doing trauma work and recounting painful memories. I guess I was wondering what other people have done/changed after getting their diagnosis? Has the diagnosis changed anyones lives in a fundamental way or made you rethink how you see yourself and your behaviours? I don't know anyone that has PTSD (apart from my Grandpa who was in WW2), so as much as I talk to other people about how I am coping, they don't quite get it, especially since I appear as though I'm ok most of the time.

A 77yo friend male, talking about a dispute in his ""men's shed"" with his president, explains the conflict at a group meeting. among that story he tells ""so I replied to that president ""if I got off my seat you'll be on a one way trip to the hospital"". My body begins to shake listening to this. My fears. No it isnt due to 3 years as a prison officer 40 years ago, nor conflict from people while carrying out my duties in semi law enforcement work over 4 decades. I know the origin- the excessive domination of my mother over us kids, the instant yelling to cause us to jump out of our skins, the emotional blackmail that surprisingly lasted well into adulthood, the fear of how our father will slap us when she meets him at the door hours after a conflict with her earlier that day, the lack of praise and so on. The seeds of anxiety were sown early in life and compounded till 27yo in my case when the volcano of emotion exploded. Now I write about it today How effective is putting fear into someone? Well, I'm about 130kg, strong, past experience in defending myself in my jobs and my mother? 90yo now, 5'3"" tall and alive and well, so I'm led to believe as I, along with my sister, have had zero contact for 11 years (our choice). That's another story but briefly she had ruined my first wedding (1985) and threatened to ruin my second (2010). Why? control, jealousy, demanding of attention, but most likely imo a denial all her life to seek help for some mental illness that likely resulted in us 3 siblings suffering. Both my sister and I attempted suicide in the 1990's, our older brother carried it out in 1978 at 26yo. All 3 of us kids bipolar. The ramifications of fear from a parent can be so effective that I'm well aware I will fear her following her passing. Why? The echoes in my mind of her voice, the sternness of it, the control like being in a emotional straight jacket and her listing all the punishments she can think of, all the time laughing. The guilt also lingers. See, when you have a bad parent and you are trying to cope, if that parent also had nurturing in her veins when you were young, that creates guilt. How could a nurturer become so evil, it must be my wrong judgement of her? Those seeds of guilt were in her pocket. I know that to cope with this fear I have to live with it. But I'm working on forgiveness. Not to her directly but within myself. To forgive her for being cruel...nah, only pursue challenges you can succeed at...

PTSD-523,Bored & Depressed,"For those of you who don't know already, I've been a carer for my mum since 2016. My mum is not physically disabled but has a lot of current health problems. She had a head injury in 2010. She can be manipulative, and is very dependent on me to stay around for the extra money. I also help clean etc. I'm now 25, have no friends or job qualifications. Everyone is encouraging me to leave, but I'm finding it very hard to breakaway! I have a lot of trauma & depression, I've started to hear voices, such as ""get a job"" ""get a life"" how ironic. It sounds like a neighbour is harrassing me though, and it's happened at two different apartments. All of my doctors want me on a medication, which can cause nightmares and fatigue etc. So I'd rather not take it! I've been researching jobs, however i'm worried that if i leave my mum will have a worse quality of life, and be sleeping in the car. Due to lack of housing and money etc. When we are living together, we can afford a nice/decent apartment to rent. But i'm kind of bored with my life and being isolated.",24yearoldgirl,Community Member,10-11-2021,PTSD and trauma,9,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/bored-depressed/td-p/29670
PTSD-524,CPTSD hits like a  freight train. -Popping my head up to say hi-,"Its hard writing this 3 years ago, it was approaching xmass and I didnt feel right. I have fought and survived major depression. This was something else. My mind was constantly preparing for doom. I felt emotionally numb. For weeks I was unable to feel,.. anything. I brought my partner a gift I couldnt afford, in a frantic attempt to try to enjoy the day. I had to hold myself back from crying as he opened it. Something was very, very wrong. I went to my doctors and asked to speak to somone. He recommended a small private psyc hospital that had programs for stress. While I was talking with there doctor, he made a Freudian slip after I revealed something and for a moment, he showed me who he was inside. That destroyed our professional relationship instantly and I asked to have him replaced. I was told that I would have to go back into the room, alone with him to talk about it. He had amnesia of that part of our talk. I felt trapped. Like noone was listening to me. The staff just ignored me. I regressed back to when I was 7 and a ward of the state, by mistake. and for a week noone noticed I was doing stuff like looking at the locks on doors, or working out which windows I could break, even though the place was completely open. after that I went straight to the local emergency room, a nurse treated me like I was drug seeking. Even though I was just trying to get help. After fighting with 2 psyc teams, I was admitted to the cardiac unit because they were concerned I was about to have a heartattack. I found a really good councler and she started throwing tests at me. She diagnosed me with CPTSD The last few years of my life have brought up childhood traumas to front & centre. its all flooding back. my earliest one is an assault. recently ive been having trouble finding anything positive spontaneously crying constantly feeling that i was robbed of a life. of basic things others have like beign happy Im 38, for the first time in my life, ive felt jealous of others in happy relationships and I hate that feeling Ive thought of self harm since i was 7. recently, those kinds of thoughs are bad. when my friend hurt me just before xmass, i considered breakign my arm, just to externalize the pain. i hate those thoughts. im autistic, a 3% deviation from neurotypical and along with other things, that gives me photographic memory which right now is not fun. all my memories at the moment are bad looking to chat wt others, share my experiences, heal maybe Nick",rippleffect,Community Member,07-02-2022,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/cptsd-hits-like-a-freight-train-popping-my-head-up-to-say-hi/td-p/2461

PTSD-526,PTSD recovery and medication,"Hi there I’m new to this. I have had PTSD from a work incident for nearly 5 years now. I’ve been in inpatient Psych facilities on and off during that time. For months each time. It’s been really hard. I finally gave in and had ECT treatment, I had this weekly for 12 months and with a combination of ECT and medication, psychology and psychiatrist support, I now find myself in functional recovery. I’ve moved away with my husband and our youngest daughter and I’ve been able to commence work and sustain it for 3 months now. Im a social worker. my husband and daughter hate medication. Im ashamed to say that I’ve overdosed a few times in the past so my husband controls all of my meds. Still. My husband continues to question the amount that I’m taking because he considers I’m ‘better now’. I have discussed this with my Psychiatrist and Psychologist who have both said that PTSD and medication are both here to stay. Of course my medication will fluctuate but I will be on it for a long time and the reason I am where I am today is medication and support. The biggest issue for me is that my husband and daughters opinions affect me deeply and I feel shame, guilt and humiliation about taking medication on top of the shame and guilt that is generally a part of PTSD. I found this group in the hope that someone else has experienced something similar and may have some advice. It’s making life very difficult.

He expresses how sorry he is for ever saying it and I don’t hold it against him because he didn’t mean it the way it came out, but unfortunately it’s playing on my mind today and after going to the shops to get him socks and deodorant, I then took myself to the bottle shop and purchased 2 bottles of Wine. I’ve cried a few times so far today and only eaten porridge at breakfast and just had some watermelon. I feel myself slipping away here and I don’t know what to do.

PTSD-528,"I'm not coping with my medical trauma TW: Blood, Surgery","Hi everyone I recently had multiple surgeries for my throat and nose in December. They were pretty regular procedures and relatively low risk. But on NYE I suddenly got a big nosebleed for the first time in my life and had to be rushed to the Emergency Department. The doctors gave me padding to stop the bleed and I was sent home by 11:30pm. I thought it was the end but it wasn't and I ended up having more bleeding episodes, in total 5 (2 minor and 3 major that required me to be hospitalised) in the past month. The most recent episode on the 20th led me to have a surgery to stop the bleeding. The doctors said that I should be ok now and that the worst is over...But I have been feeling anxious at the thought that I'm going to have another major bleeding episode. It's been 9 days since the surgery but I still can't shake off the anxiety or fear I keep feeling. I try not to think about it for too long but it gets extremely heightened when I'm by myself at home. I get worried about everything I do, thinking that any action would trigger a nosebleed. Even though the doctors say they think the bleed wasn't triggered by anything I did, I still can't bring myself to believe them.

PTSD-530,Trauma and alcoholic impulses triggered by friend,"Hello. I am a 25 year-old man who very recently stopped drinking alcohol. I was using it as a consequence of being raised by an alcoholic mother, and since confronting that trauma, I've realised that I need to quit. I've gone cold turkey after years of depending on alcohol, every single day. I've got an upcoming appointment with my GP, but due to COVID, seeing her is tricky. I can't move the appointment any earlier. I feel very isolated, and the support service I've been referred onto hasn't called me back. I've called a few times to try and talk to someone, but they're always busy. I'm trying really hard not to drink again. It's only been 5 days, but every passing hour feels like hell. I want a drink so badly. One of my friends contacted me, asking if I knew someone who could supply him with drugs. He sent me an emotional message saying he ""needed"" a substance to get through his own mental health issues, and this made me very angry. He knows I'm newly sober, yet he's triggering me by talking about his own substance use. I told him that I can't help him right now, and don't want to hear about substance use to handle mental health problems, but I'm still angry. I feel like nobody's taking my struggle seriously. I'm feel that I'm all on my own. Now that I'm not drinking, my emotions are heightened, and I'm experiencing everything so intensely. I'm having dreams about my mother's alcohol use. I thought I was over my PTSD, but I'm obviously not. I'd just like to know I'm not alone, and whether you have any advice for a newly-sober man. I'd appreciate support.",thorneinmyside,Community Member,27-01-2022,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trauma-and-alcoholic-impulses-triggered-by-friend/td-p/14277

PTSD-533,Why do I need someone to be with me?,"Hi all, I was looking to see if someone has some insights on my current situation and how it relates to past experiences. I'm looking to see if others have had similar experiences and can maybe point me in the right direction. I’m not looking for medication as I have been down that road before. I know I have Complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder because I experienced various types of trauma as a child. I had anxiety about going to school. Because of this anxiety, my parents decided to take me to school one day and talk with the principal. Long story short, I was abandoned and left in the hands of the principal who was verbally and physically abusive as he dragged me to the classroom. This was his attempt to stop me from being anxious. A few years later at a different school my Dad had to wait outside the classroom for me while I was inside being taught due to my anxiety. There was less anxiety knowing that Dad was outside. I was homeschooled after this and managed to work and study. I have seen countless mental health professionals and have been on various antidepressants due to several setbacks. Fast forward to the present day and it appears that I am facing the ""needing someone with me due to overwhelming anxiety"" situation again. In late 2019, I experienced my first major panic attack following a run. I took myself to hospital due to a continued fast heart rate post-run. I was later released from hospital with everything checking out as ok with diagnosis being a panic attack. Since then, life has been extremely difficult. Since the panic attack I have not been able to be by myself (except for the rare occasion where I challenged myself). The fear around my heart rate has limited by ability to have a verbal conversation with a mental health professional. Basically, any type of stress triggers panic which triggers the heart rate fear. I believe the fear is a cover for what happened to me as a child. I am still working with a psychologist via email. What I really want to ask is what is the reason for me needing someone to be with me at the moment? Why did I need my Dad to stay outside the classroom that day? What am I afraid of? What I know for sure is that anxiety feelings scare me greatly. Why do I struggle to be ok with intense anxiety feelings? The overriding message when I am in an anxiety provoking situation is that I am going die. I feel like the panic attack has exposed the child traumas hence why I need someone with me.

PTSD-535,Severe trauma ruining my life and the only therapist I can afford said she’s not qualified to help me. i’m scared and losing hope,"I’m 26 years old. Last year I recovered repressed memories of being raped as a child and it made so many things click into place for me. i have vaginismus, general fear of intimacy, severe social anxiety and depression. I neglected my health for years and didn’t take care of my body, I didn’t open up about the problems I was having in school and ended up dropping out. I’m certain I have an undiagnosed learning disability, I’m guessing ADHD but of course I don’t know for sure because I haven’t gotten a diagnosis. I have no job and still live with my parents, and no friends. I’m afraid of meeting new people because I’ll always be the ‘ugly friend’ and I just don’t have any social skills either. I got a referral for my local walk-in clinics therapist who only charged $50 per session. I had my first session with her by phone and I told her everything and she told me that she wasn’t qualified to help me with the trauma related to being molested. She didn’t even know what vaginismus is and I had to explain it to her. She emailed me the names of four places that actually specialise in that area and said that if I explain my situation then they might give me a reduced fee. So far I’ve only contacted one and haven’t received a response yet. Im running out of hope. I need therapy and medication, I need treatment for my vaginismus, but I don’t have a job. My Dad will be paying for everything but our family isn’t wealthy, $300 for each session on top of any medication I’ll be prescribed will be too much. I’m not suicidal right now but I know if I let this go on, I’m going to become suicidal in the future.

I’ve read that you can get a pelvic exam done with anaesthesia but I don’t know how to go about asking for that and I don’t have money to pay for anaesthesia. I don’t know what to do. I just want help, why isn’t this stuff affordable? What am I suppose to do if I can’t live my life? Because that’s the thing. I’m not living my life and also happen to have trauma and mental illness. I’m not living at all. I can barely function. I rely on my parents for everything but I don’t want to put that pressure on them, I want to take care of them as they get older, not have to be taken care of by them.

PTSD-536,What is wrong with me?,"A few years ago I reconciled with my husband after he physically and sexually assaulted me. We had been married over a decade and had children and he spent some time in custody and did his community service and swore to me this had changed him. And it has changed him. He hasn’t been abusive since that day, almost 4 years ago. Prior to the assault he had been for 3 years addicted to synthetic marijuana. I had no idea for the first year as he did nothing but lie to me. I discovered in the third year of his addiction that he was also on dating websites and this absolutely broke my heart. More than being brutalised by him. I can’t get over it. I can’t move on from it. I still get triggered. My question is, why can I forgive all the other things he’s done, but not this? What is wrong with me that I choose this to be upset about? It seems so trivial by comparison to all the horrible things he’s done over the course of the relationship. I feel defective.

PTSD-539,Porn and video game addiction in men to mask trauma,"Hello. about 5 years ago I underwent some trauma where i was in a failed relationship-and all alone in a big city!. I was 31 at the time about to get engaged. The relationship ended without a reason, and it activated severe anxiety and depression in me. I needed to self medicate and i was never a drinker or took drugs, so what did i do to sooth my pain!- porn and gaming! This then resulted in an addiction which i beleive is prevelent in youg men! I beleive it is the new epidemic!. after 5 years of attempts to remove my porn addiction, i had been successful on and off but always came back to this crux, no matter how hard i tried! i would crave a relationship with a woman but my mind would always give in to this devil which is porn. I have tried to start many many relationships with women, where i would date a woman for a few months, then end it. This cycle was a result of my addiciton. For me its got nothing to do with the actual porn, but the dopamine rush my mind gets to sooth my mental health issues. What has worked for me was an accountability partner and also device app restricitions. I am not means healed from this as porn has been something i have used to sooth my pain a least a couple of time a week for a decade. I dont know a young man that does not look at porn! I am worried for the youth and the effect this has on a generation and the side effects it will bring to society. Because in most mens mind, its not about the women in porn, its about the dopamine rush that cannot be found elsewhere! This dopamine rush is so strong that the mind craves it and will do anything to get it. The website: 'your brain on porn' has helped me a lot to deal with this devil! The real struggle is when i dont have access to porn my mind tries to find anyway possible to get it! Also, im worried that when it is removed entirely will my mental health issues calm down? how can i deal with these anxiety and depression symptoms? How do i approach a woman to ask her out? How will i build a serious relationship? Will i be able to crave my woman or will this porn desire be in the back of my mind?

PTSD-540,Introducing myself,"Hi, I'm a middle age man who was diagnosed with complex PTSD some years ago due to working for over 2 decades in the security industry. There are not specific event that gave me PTSD, just an accumulation of things: being threatened with beating / stabbing / shooting, having to talk down jumpers, having to physically restrain guys trying to bash their girlfriend / wife, the odd hostage taking and just too many number of times having to deal with aggressive drunks, junkies and generally unpleasant people. Because of the PTSD, I tend to have what the therapist called ""Hypervigilance"" and what my wife calls ""Guard Mode"". I find it nearly impossible to just relax, unless I'm quite drunk, and when going out with my wife, I will tend to just keep ""vigilant"" around us in case of troubles, something which is heightened if someone is being loud or disruptive. Following my diagnostic, I tried to get therapy including 2 years ago seeing an Anger Management therapist. I haven't really found any of it helpful and am now trying to find way I can get better by myself so I don't start crying or raging out of nowhere. I've also tried various medecine and dosage but either they don't have any effect or else they make me so drowsy the next day that I can't do anything useful for half of the day. I also tried yoga but honestly, the whole gentle talking / supernatural talk made me more annoyed than anything. I'm mainly looking for things I could do by myself to try to get myself to not crying or raging so easily so that I can fix other parts of my life.",Mononc,Community Member,03-01-2022,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/introducing-myself/td-p/18930

After being referred to a counselor my Dr retired. I changed practices and during a check up I made mention of a couple of things that was a concern, inability to complete tasks, lack of attention to detail, cyclic thoughts. It felt like my brain was buzzing most of the time. Then I said that I never felt better than when I was on a weight loss drug, then wham! Psychology appointment and now take another medication, the brain is calm and I'm able to function normally, now the thing that I want to ask, now a lot of other issues that I never realized are starting to surface, separation anxiety being the one that stands out. Has anyone else experienced this, once one thing comes under control, something else will come up that needs attention?

PTSD-542,Want to take leave from uni to get better but am conflicted,"Am 19 and last few years I've not been mentally well (dealing with childhood trauma, major depressive disorder, anxiety, maybe c-PTSD + constant re-triggering because my parents marriage blew up for real - infidelity, probable incest, domestic violence, psychological and verbal abuse, court orders, police getting called on the regular]. By some miracle got into medical school in the mess of it all which has been my only reason for persisting through everything but am really questioning it all now. During this year, I spent majority of the time stressing, binge eating, having breakdowns and suicidal thoughts, mentally beating myself up and wanting to quit medicine (but honestly it might just have been COVID/lockdown?). At some point during one of the terms, I couldn’t even stand showing up to classes and half-listening (I had to excuse myself in the middle of a tutorial once, just could not cope). During that term, I was so close to just throwing in the towel but managed to hold on only because of the encouragement of some of my lecturers, family/friends. People say that it’s normal to have periods of being extremely unmotivated but I feel that the things that have been happening to me I just can’t put up with anymore. I keep wondering that maybe if I just had a more balanced life it'd all be okay - despite of it all, still getting good grades, I have a few good friends in med school, so it hasn't objectively been all bad. Because of my program layout if I take leave now I have to take leave for two years. I'm scared that I'll come back to medicine and find that nothing has changed and it's just as bad as it was when I left it and I just wasted two years for nothing while all of my friends are 2 years in front of me. I'm scared that we'll go back into lockdown or smth and won't be able to do anything. If I were to take leave I think I’d move out of home, get more independence, work on my health and get better, find a part-time job in perhaps something completely unrelated to medicine/education/studying for experience, travel, have a break from all the stress + pursue some of my hobbies.",MT3286,Community Member,30-12-2021,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/want-to-take-leave-from-uni-to-get-better-but-am-conflicted/td-p/15659
PTSD-543,Still affected by high school trauma,"Hi everyone, I have been seeing a psychologist for a year now and have finally made some progress in addressing my deep-set anxiety and depression. I wasn’t overtly bullied at school, but I wasn’t resilient enough to deal with constant horrible gossip and peers sneakily trying to bring me down, which resulted in me retreating into myself and really not having any self-confidence, which has stayed with me well into my thirties. Because there wasn’t any “overt” evidence of bullying I never classed it as such, but am learning to recognise that it actually comes in many forms. This deep-set trauma isn’t helped by the fact that I still have a couple of close friends from school who, in turn, are close friends with people who made my high school life hell. I don’t see these other people often, but when I do in occasional group settings I am triggered by panic attacks and am really rendered incapable of being able to move on and enjoy myself. After those encounters I spend days ruminating and feeling awful about myself even though I am well aware that there isn’t anything I can do to change days gone by, only the days ahead. Another such group event is on this weekend and - sure enough - the panic and embarrassment and depressive thoughts are back, and they are frustrating as all hell. I would love to seek the advice of others who are going/have gone through similar experiences. I like to think that one day I can move on from those awful high school days properly and I do feel really weak in that I haven’t been able to yet.

PTSD-544,I feel lost and broken.,Today I saw my therapist. She has helped me feel safe and connected with her over time. After seeing her in session today I felt really guilty for having sad emotions and expressing them to her. Even though it’s her job to help me. I don’t want to be a burden of a client. I struggle to end our sessions because I’m afraid to feel this feelings on my own. I’m carrying all this weight and pain and it makes me feel like this is all that I am. I am made up of sadness and trauma. And I feel like at the moment I can’t be around anyone without weighing them down too. I don’t think that who I am is good enough for anything. My confidence feels shattered and I feel really lost. I feel like I should be doing better. I can’t sleep at night because my mind is repeating the abuse I experienced from my dad growing up.

PTSD-545,I'm in trouble.  I could do with help and support.,"I am a 65 year old male. I was subject to childhood abuse and trauma. I ran from 'home'. Lived rough. Seen it tough. I have been many things. Had many relationships. Two marriages. Helped raise to great kids. I have been in a relationship for over four and a half years. I moved a long way to be in the relationship after being invited by my female partner to stay with her. I made a decision with her reassurance to leave my last professional job. It was a huge move based on trust. I was painted a beautiful picture. I committed to fulfilling my part in what was to be a good and loving relationship. In the time till now I have given my absolute all. I have supported her through her many personal traumas including sever chronic illness, anxiety, and depression. Only a few months into my living with her she began criticizing me for every thing I did. She worked while I did housework, cooked, and did a great deal of home maintenance and renovation for her. I paid my way and also worked on her home. I did tens of thousands of dollars of work on her property. Close friends of hers died. Then her parents died. I supported her and comforted her through her grief. There were many other problems she had to face including a very stressful job. Her criticism of me was very constant and often very harsh. I became nervous and felt my confidence and self-esteem was suffering. I am not the one to be a 'doormat' so I consistently spoke up for myself. This would just make things worse. She would accuse me of doing things or saying things that were either complete fabrications or distortions of reality. I was to blame for anything that went wrong or any conflict we may have. She told me what I said, what I thought, she corrected me constantly on word usage ( and I am a very well educated man), and rarely if ever complimented me on things. I was beginning to establish a small business from home as had been planned when after one of our frequent fights, she tried to kick me out. I stood my ground but left as soon as I was able. Over the years she has ended our relationship several times. She has always blamed me and rarely acknowledged any fault on her part.She has just ended our relationship again. I am blamed. When trying to problem solve she constantly blames me, accuses me, distorts things. She will not let me finish sentences when I try speaking up. She insists her version of facts is true.

PTSD-549,Feeling incapable of solo parenting,"Has anyone experienced huge fear you’re not capable of looking after your kids on your own if you leave your abusive partner? We left my two daughters’ dad in January after my psych finally convinced me to make contact with a domestic violence service. I didn’t know he was abusive. He’d been physical in the past but it was only a few times so I brushed it off. It’s mainly been sexual and emotional abuse. He used to yell and swear at the kids, which is why I left in the end! I knew it wasn’t right and I didn’t want them to think it was ok. Once we left, we were put in crisis accommodation and I had a risk assessment done which resulted in child protection being involved. They put restrictions in place which meant he was only allowed supervised visits and during those few months I barely spoke to him. I realised later I didn’t have a panic attack in that time. Fast forward a few months and we were on the verge of becoming homeless (the girls and I) so I let him buy a house under his name (when we went to buy a house I found out all of our accounts were under his name only, even my inheritance) my professional supports tried to talk me out of going back to/ live with him so they put us in crisis accommodation again while we waited for a unit and get our name on a list for a refuge. We were in a dark and dingy motel 40 minutes from home and I didn’t cope well! I couldn’t fight anymore. I felt so weak and so scared but was trying to be strong for my girls but I just couldn’t so we went back to my mums which was also toxic and now we’re here in our new house and he has been pretty good, still not great but I am so turned off by my previous experiences of getting out and going into the system. I feel completely incapable of looking after our daughters on my own, even though I did it for months. I just feel like now he’s back in our life I can’t do it on my own anymore. I feel like I need him for everything. I need someone else to be responsible for our daughters even if that doesn’t involve actually doing anything for them, just knowing I’m not solely responsible takes enough presssure off me to cope. I don’t feel like my mental health will survive me being on my own again. Has anyone else had a similar experience? And did you manage to overcome those fears? I cut off all of my professional supports because they kept voicing concern about our safety with him and it was stopping me from comfortably living with him, but I’ve re-engaged with my psychologist.",Anzee,Community Member,26-07-2021,PTSD and trauma,45,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/feeling-incapable-of-solo-parenting/td-p/19061

It has the same feelings, the fear, etc. The body sensations. But I am struggling so much. Fighting so hard against it.

I lived there for the first 7 weeks by myself (he was in jail for a few months). I looked after the place like nothing else. Within the space of 2 months of him getting out of jail the place looks like a bomb hit it. Holes and gashes out of walls, bedroom door destroyed, main door, screen door, bathroom door all damaged, oven door damaged. Big screen TV destroyed + the small TV & playstation and other smaller items. I am only on the DSP, and i have also accumulated $5000 debt trying to make up for his lack of financial contributions due to his alcohol/drug use. We have been in a temporary 2 bedroom house for the past few weeks due to storm damage on the other property. He has already had several violent outbursts here and done even more damage. He is asleep now but today has been the worst in a while. I just know that more damage will happen. I am the only one on the lease. I just feel like running. But no where to go.

I need to find a new, regular doctor and psycholgist and I just can't man. Having to do the spiel and breaking down in front of them... far out. Me not really being able to convey myself. I'm so disconnected from my body. I regularly catch myself realising I'm not breathing or breathing really quickly and shallow. I haven't slipped in a hole this deep in a long time. I really thought I was past this. I just quit my job even after cutting down to 2 days. It took so much mental time to recover and the anxiety I felt outside of work constantly about going back. Having to pretend, put on face, be professional, giving, loving, patient, quick and on the ball. I couldnt. I just spent hours daydreaming and feeling pain when I have to 'come back'.

My bf and Mum (the only people I really have) just say go to the doctor, any doctor. 'Go on meds, eat well & excercise' sure doc. I'm tired of being gaslit into being recommended 'what's best for me'. I just need some support in practicing healthy people skills. In a safe space. Constant flashbacks and painful memories violate my mind. I've gotten myself out of slumps before but this is different. The longer is goes on the harder it is to remember why bother at all.

I had too call emergency services, I had too call him Mum and explain. ever since then I’ve been completely lost. I ruined my career, jumping between jobs at various mine sites and basically burning every bridge I had. I lost my relationship, I pushed good friends away and I completely lost who I am as a person. every bit of interest in anything I had has been lost. I’m coming here today because I want advice. I want the nightmares too stop, I want too have a normal life, I want the thoughts of what happened too stop because they completely ruin my day.

I have limited family near me and only one true friend. They ask how I am and its easiest just to say I'm fine, everything's okay.

PTSD-558,ANOTHER FRIEND IS NOW DYING FROM CANCER - WHAT SHOULD I SAY?,"Hi everyone As we get older and certainly wiser, it becomes easier I think, to deal with what life throws at you as life's priorities become much clearer. You learn to walk away from what's just not important, stop worrying so much about trivialities and think more about what it really means to life a good life - 'A life well lived' in other words. Well last year the best friend of my wife and myself got cancer, and now has about three months to live. She in in New Zealand and we speak every couple of weeks on Face Time. Yesterday I got shocking news that the wife of one of my best friends also has cancer. Not sure what the prognosis is but she is on her second round of chemo and losing her amazing hair already. So - what are the best words to use when speaking or writing to a cancer sufferer? The friend due to die shortly has confided that she is really tired of people telling her how strong she is, you have got this, be strong, you are a fighter etc etc. Last week I said to her that she must feel really awful and sometimes angry about what has happened to her, and she burst into tears saying all she wants is friends to understand make an effort to listen. In other words, show a little true empathy and not just empty words of encouragement that can sound so false. Now a second friend has cancer - we learn about in on Facebook only yesterday. Her husband is a really good mate and told me they just weren't up to ringing people so please forgive them for posting on Facebook a couple of weeks after the diagnosis. Nearly all the posts on Facebook are all about how strong she is, what a fighter, give it a big kick in the bum etc etc. I sent a post and a personal message as well, reminding them about the holiday we had early last year (before Covid) and how much we should all look forward the the opportunity to do that again! Not that I look for this at all, but did notice my post got heaps of likes. So the big question is - what does the cancer sufferer really want to hear? I know everyone is different and so are friendships. It's just that this double lot of rotten news has been really hard to take and made an impact on me that I wasn't expecting. And it's going to get worse as the end nears for both of them. Any comments from forum users who have battled through close friends deaths would be appreciated. Especially concerning what is was that the dying friend found most comforting to hear. Thanks very much, I hope to hear from you.

PTSD-559,*Trigger warning - Sexual Assault* Scared lost and alone what do I do?,"From the age of 12 till I was 13 I was S/A and abused by my mother's BF until he was deported back to the USA because his visa ran out. I was so happy he was still in contact for while after he left, I hated pretending everything was fine and pretend that the things he would say over the phone was not horrible, but there was still the threat that he was coming back, but he stopped calling so I thought I was free & no one had to know what he did to me. Until I was 15 & my mother had found him on social media she told me she was thinking about getting in contact with him again told her NO but I had to tell her why. She told me that she believed me we cried, I had felt like I wasn't alone any more. the next day I went the police station to make a report. After this day the police collected evidence & statements the relationship between my self & my mother declined. I couldn't understand why but she seemed to be mad at me one day a thought popped into my head ""I don't think she believes me, but she is my mother she knows I would never lie about this. Right?"" For about the next 3 years every few months I would get a phone call from the police checking if I wanted to continue with the case I would always say ""YES"" they would say ok then end of the call. It's would destroy my mental health every time but I wanted justice so I kept saying yes. But eventually the polices stopped calling. Years go by I found out my mother was telling people what happened to me & that she didn't believe me. Then last year an officer had come across my case & so the officer called me, told me that if it was OK with me he wanted to continue with the case & that he had already contact with the FBI they had enough evidence and information to extradite 'HIM' back to Aus & charge 'HIM'. This was ment with a lot of feelings but I said yes. But we are still in the middle of a pandemic so it keeps getting pushed back and now I'm stuck in limbo waiting for international travel to open so I can go to court now I'm stuck here feeling like it's never going to happen, if/when It does what will happen what will court be like?

PTSD-560,How to get my life back on track?,"Hi everyone. I had a lot of bad experiences, mostly throughout my 20's experimenting with different kinds of drugs and overall just a host of bad decisions like dropping out of university, I have also not been able to keep a stable job. I lost all of my friends throughout my twenties and now spend most of my time alone. I feel pretty alone most times and have trouble socializing, keeping a job, making friends and functioning in the world. I would really like to get myself back on track and live a ""normal"" life if possible. I think I developed trauma from some negative drug experiences. How can I get my life back on track?

PTSD-562,How to move on,"Hi All, I've not been around for a while. It has been quite an interesting year since May last year. I've struggled quite a bit with Complex PTSD, BPD Depression, suicidal thoughts, panic attacks and grief. Where to from here? I have been stuck for a while with little energy to move on and not much of an idea how to move on anyway. It is hard when my mind decides it wants to disconnect as that feels safer and then I wander through each day like a person in a movie set, just pretending. Empty. Distant. Anyone else have trouble getting from one day to the next, waking up in the morning and wondering what on earth you are going to do with that day? At least at work I know I need to be there and have a rough idea what I am supposed to be doing! I wrote more here and deleted it. I have reached out for help in so many places. Maybe I am just too broken to be fixed. Maybe this is as good as it gets. Maybe I just need to be more grateful for all I do have and continue to stuff my issues down inside of me hoping they don't find a way to the surface anymore. The last psychologist I saw told me I need to buy new curtains for the house, a comfortable chair to sit in and new pictures for the walls! Oh yes, that will certainly help with the CPTSD, BPD, Suicidal thoughts, past traumas and unresolved grief that all come uninvited to attack my mind. Why didn't I think of doing that earlier! I don't need a psychologist I need thousands of dollars and an interior designer! How to move on?

PTSD-564,Nasty people and unsupportive partner,"I have lived in a nice little area for the last few years with my young children. Lately neighbouring properties have been turned into moto X tracks (I am not against the bikes) I am being targeted as soon as my partner goes away for work. Kids riding motorbikes,constant loud revving, starting at 7am and not finishing until 6pm on the weekends.(only supposed to be a 2hour limit for dirtbikes in the area) I have already spoken to one of the parents asking them to not rev excessively near my house with a response of I don't care attitude. I have gotten used to the noise however my young kids wanted to go and play outside but were unable to due to the terrible dust created. I had to ask my kids to stay inside due to one of them having a chronic health issue. I felt unsafe to ask them to stop riding near my house. I called my partner who basically told me to""get over it"" Now I just want to take my kids and leave as I can't stand living here and don't want to be with someone who can't help stand up for me . The only trouble is that having a chronicly ill child makes it hard to do that.

PTSD-565,Working through my trauma to find myself again,"Hi all I just needed a place to express how grateful I am to have reached this point in my life. I have been to many dark places and it's nice to recognise the light again. I can now understand how I was unable to move through my own trauma. I was feeling stuck for decades until I decided to park relationship troubles and life to focus solely on myself. It was hard, I felt selfish and unworthy. I realised I was skirting my issues and taking on my partner's crap that was being projected onto me. I was unable to untangle me and my mess from her mess. After a short stint in a Trauma Recovery Unit, I feel strong all of a sudden, all those attempts at boundary setting have paid off. Twenty years of working on myself with Psychologists, Psychiatrists, hospitalisations, EMDR, ACT, DBT, misdiagnosis, anxiety and depression have certainly paid off. I now have a definate sense of who I am and what my values are. Years of denying I was born into the wrong body has been pushed down for too long. Recently I outed myself to my immediate family and a few close friends. My anxiety levels rose but not to unmanageable levels. The excitement I feel at having options to explore now that I have accepted I am trans trumps the anxiety I feel poking my head out of the shadows. My partner has her own self growth journey and we are at very different stages. It saddens me and I know I am doing the right thing separating her stuff from mine. It may see us heading in different directions and that is okay. Incredibly sad and okay. I need to and will continue to put me first. I feel worthy now. I no longer feel selfish. I feel proud of the hole I have crawled out of. I feel excited by the future. Self compassion, self validation and sharing with others is such a beautiful place to be finding myself.

Next thing I remember is they're both having sex with me (dp) which I've never done before and still feel gross about. Next morning I wake up naked, sore and with my bf telling me I need to go home now, they have things to do. Had to get it off my chest.

PTSD-567,Moving on from a traumatic past,"Hi Everyone! Just want to start off by saying thank you for reading this if you are. I know this is a safe space for me to vent and put all my emotions out in the open so thank you. I was adopted at the age of 2 weeks old by my aunt who was unable to have a child, she was currently married at the time she adopted me. At a very young age of 4 years old, i was abused by a family friend whom I never disclosed to the family at that time. At such a young age, I was told to keep my mouth shut and not say anything as the old asian culture saying was ""Children should be seen but not heard"". My aunt's husband at the time was very abusive and I have seen a lot of things that a young child should never see. Luckily, she was able to escape him by leaving the country altogether and the way we left the country was very rushed and secretive. We moved to Australia as she married an Australian and we moved our simple life to a city where we had to start all over again - a new start they say! But sadly at the age of 13 - 19 years old, I was sexually abused every weekend by this stepfather. My aunt at the time worked a lot so she was not around to protect me but even then, she knew the abuse was happening as I would always be angry and sad all the time. She never questioned me or asked if i was okay when the abuse was happening. She too was being emotionally and financially abused by this man who had controlled every aspect of our lives. I was unable to stay connected with friends or passed high school as the abuse became more horrific and violent. I'm now 27 years old and started a new job at a law firm 5 months ago, but I'm hitting another low depression state where I'm unable to find the motivation to get up every day at work. I'm worried and stressed that I will be potentially losing my job.",Mgold23,Community Member,08-11-2021,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/moving-on-from-a-traumatic-past/td-p/22956

PTSD-569,Gaslighted.,"I am a young female who has been sexually and romantically attracted to a single, older male since 2017. It was love at first sight for him (in 2016) although I did not become attracted to him until a year later. I did not realise at the time that he was a package deal - and I am not just talking about his young daughter - I am talking about his crazy and clingy ex-wife (who refuses to let go of him as she is afraid of being alone) as well as everybody else in her family (including his ex's sons, daughters, nieces, nephews and grandchildren - none of which obtain any biological relation this this man.) The ex wife determines who is good enough for everyone in her family to date, and who isn't. The man I am attracted to co-parents with his ex-wife and I believe they continuously give their daughter false hope that they are getting back together. This obviously bothers me, as I am clearly attracted to him and wan to get to know him more/get into a relationship with him without his ex and her family involved. I ideally want nothing to do with the ex and her family. They are the kind of people who are ""liked"" by everyone. They need to understand that I do NOT like them and their family. They need to leave the man I am interested in ALONE. However, I cannot praise this man at all. He has lied compulsively about me to his lawyer and to my lawyer and to his entire family and to me as well. He has made me go crazy and has made me question my sanity, which has resulted in three trips to the psychiatric ward of a hospital in one year. He has also been verbally abusive towards me. He has said things to me like: 'whatever medication you're taking clearly isn't working', 'you have more issues than perviously thought', 'you're not very clever' and, he then stood to his feet and curled his hands into fists and screamed in my face that I am a 'retard.' But, get this - he thinks about me, but isn't sure about what he wants. I also did hear from a third party that his ex is psychotically jealous of me. She needs to grow up, really. I am currently seeing a psychotherapist privately and I usually talk to her about this and she has been excellent. I have also spoken with a BeyondBlue counsellor about this and they have stated that I am experiencing intimate violence from this man. I love this man very much, but I also think that I am too good for him, and I think that he knows this was well, hence the abuse I experienced from him.",nib,Community Member,14-09-2021,PTSD and trauma,14,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/gaslighted/td-p/33890
PTSD-570,Should I engage a lawyer to finally get out of limbo?,"Hi Everyone, I have been separated from my Narc ex for a bit over a year now. We have two kids together and during mediation he refused to really make any parenting plan until we sold our house. The little we have come to an agreement on are just basic human decency such as communicating to me instead of our children about plans. He can't even follow that. I am sick of him controlling every aspect of the situation and ignoring what many professionals have told him in not putting the kids in the middle which he does when he makes plans by making them with the kids and not through me. He, of course, sees our children when it is convenient for him and suits his social life leaving it difficult for me to make any plans for myself or with our children. I think I am going to forgo a second mediation and get a lawyer. He will not be happy but I feel like it is the only way to regain some control and do what is best for our children. I have heard horror stories of Narcs stretching this stuff out as they do not want to comply or agree...the cost of it all scares me....but my children and I can't do this anymore. I want a safe, predictable and secure plan for them and what we have currently isn't it. Is this the right move? I am nervous about ""poking the bear"" but I also don't care. The last straw for me was planning an event for our youngest's birthday without consulting me at all or informing me. I work full time and therefore won't be able to see my youngest on his birthday until he comes back home late that night. I had plans for us but then had to change them and now will celebrate with him Saturday. I think I'm expecting to be able to coparent with him and eventually he will come to the party but after this I realise that is never going to happen. Any advise anyone?

PTSD-573,Toxic Family,"Hi, In my early childhood 5-7 years old I would be first hand witness to my mother & father arguing which led to my father leaving the house & seeing other women, & also witnessed my father being violent towards my mum. I witnessed my mum & her side of the family always throwing shade at my dad & bagging him to his kids. My 2 older sister's would get psychically violent with one another if they didn't agree on something. My family never had a healthy way of communicating, everything just resulted and ended with violence. Due to financial reasons, my family decided that it was best off they leave me with my grandmother till they could get back on their feet as they were struggling to find somewhere to live & we would never have stable accomodation. My grandmother treated me very poorly & would always favour my 1st cousin which was my age over me. If my cousin would do something wrong, I would get the blame for it, no questions asked. I think I heard her say once that she Neva liked me because I looked like my father. My father passed away when I was 7 years old due to having a liver failure from too much alcohol consumption, even though he knew he was going to die that didn't stop him from drinking & leaving us financially broke. At the age of 10 I witnessed my mother suffer her first heart attack when we got an emergency call to make our way to the hospital, and witnessed her eyes roll back as she was suffering a heart attack right in front of me. A few years later she suffered another 2 heart attacks and I was first hand witness and called the ambulance. Due to financial difficulties that my father left us in, my mum had to continue to work to pay for the food, rent, clothes etc, and I was left in the care of my 2 older sisters. They had their own demons they were facing & started consuming heavy drugs and I was around 9-10 years old when it first started. The drug habit of my 2 sisters went on for years, and I would always be there to support them being the youngest sibling I felt like the eldest. My school life wasn't the best, it wasn't very organised and I would hardy ever attend because of my family issues & I felt ashamed because I thought my friends knew about what was happening at home. My middle sister had a toxic ex that was on heavy drugs, that would stalk & harass her, try to control her & that's something that I took onto my shoulders and would try my best to help her with also.

PTSD-576,Just a vent,Where do i start. i lost my mother when i was 8 to breast cancer. She was the glue that held everything together. She did everthing for me and my siblings and every other child in our extended family. I miss her. But at the end she started to ignore me. She thought that it was better i get used to her not being there. It didnt help though it made me so angry and sad. Still does. 2 weeks after she died my father got a new girlfriend. They shared a love of drinking together that always ended up in full blown fist fighting and police being called. He only ever did the bare minimum. I had nits from the time i was 8 until 14. He never even tried to get them out. New GF was number 1 priority. I remember being so sick once i could barely walk and just needed my father. He told me i was a hypochondriac and left me home alone so he could go to the pub and gamble/drink his pay away with her. She had older kids who were into drugs and crime. I was left with them alot so saw so much stuff i should not have. So i started using with them when i was quite young. I stopped going to school and moved out when i was 14. They were pretty abusive too. When my birthday would come around i would get 50 from my dad to buy myself something. When i came home i got punched in the face by one of them for not buying clothes that fitted them. Dad didnt care and would never say anything to GF as it would just cause a fight. There are so many other things that happened i could go on for days. Im now 35 and have 2 young kids. Thier dads are absent. My oldest blames me for his father not being here. He has never met him and he still likes him better than me. I love them so much but parenting is hard. Especially alone with no support. Life is so expensive so im always barley scrapping by every week. Just another woe. I feel numb to everything. Im in a big black hole and i dont know if there will ever be light at the end. I would never do anything silly as i could never leave them. I just want some respite.

PTSD-577,Childhood Emotional Neglect,"I was emotionally neglected throughout my childhood. It's a recent revelation for me too. I'm middle aged, and am only now able to piece together the 'how' of why I am the way I am. It's an enlightening process, like I'm seeing things for the first time. Though I'm having trouble dealing with all these connections I'm making between my past and how it has shaped me. There's a lot of amazement, which is why I used the word 'enlightenment' to describe what I'm finding. But as well there's sadness over the loss of what I missed out on. I think back to the child I was, and it makes me cry for him. I wish I could hug him and just listen to what was on his mind. I have a Son now, and I couldn't imagine treating him the way I was treated. So when I ask myself why I was treated the way I was, the emotional reaction I get is resentment towards my parents. I can't understand why I was treated like furniture that could be packed up and moved from city to city, school to school, and told that it would toughen me up. I know that my parents had their own demons, so much so that I'm surprised they stayed married throughout all the upheaval and fighting. But even so, I still can't understand why they thought that I could simply deal with things on my own, rather than viewing me as a vulnerable child who needed to be cared for. I'm a very withdrawn personality now, and I think that I must have withdrawn at a very young age, because I don't remember ever acting out or protesting their behaviour. I think that I simply accepted that I was an expendable part of their plans. Regardless, the resentment I'm feeling troubles me because it's unresolved. My parents are elderly now, and I want to confront them about my childhood, because I want answers. But I know that it would hurt them. My Father would react with scepticism and deflect it somehow, likely assuming CEN isn't a serious issue and that other people had far worse childhoods (which the latter is true). Or he'd just get angry and blow his top like he always does. My Mother would be hurt. She wouldn't know what to say other than that they tried their best. These predictions make it seem like a hopeless conversation that wouldn't have any positive outcomes.

PTSD-578,Questioning some things,"Those of you who know me know I have been bouncing from one rough life event to another for years, without really any time to take a breath in between. I can state well enough the things that have happened to me, but haven't had much energy to delve deeply into what those things have done to me. In the time off work since my partner had major surgery (yup, another fun crisis), I had time to start pulling at threads, to get a Mental Health Care Plan, see a psych and talk to a counsellor. As much as I always knew my life has been a steaming pile of crap, the threads I am pulling are connecting dots and giving rise to possible clarifications of events and what has arisen in their wake. My childhood was severely neglectful. Mostly emotionally, but also in some physical ways. We kids didn't sleep in the (perfectly good) house, we slept in a caravan nearby - Mum cleaned up her and Dad's bedroom and the kitchen after the mouse plagues, but apparently our rooms weren't worth the effort. He carries on about her ""unfit"" parenting, but it's not like Dad did anything about it either. We were fed and clothed well enough. Never a lot of attention from either of them. I don't remember a single hug from either one during my childhood. Mum would immediately disinfect her hands if by some chance she came to touch one of us. Some years later, post parental divorce, Mum's settlement money ran out and we endured a brief stint without a home, a much longer (years) stint of inadequate food and no hot water. I actually became pretty functional after moving out. Worked, studied, maintained a place on my own. Went through a couple of less than healthy relationships and endured with surprising resilience. Then came the last relationship. First two years, no major problems. Then bam, he's unfaithful. Enter ol' Blue's depression, that's the straw that breaks the camel's back. Damn fool remained in contact with him and we tried again at the relationship. To be fair, he didn't repeat that particular mistake. He tried hard to redeem himself and be a better partner. Until the ring was on the finger. Engagement in place, all effort fell away little by little. Dear gods did the neglect become overwhelmingly severe. I kind of got that there was a theme, but it's literally only now, years after breaking up with him, that I see why it was that straw that began my depression - just how closely what he did mirrored my parents' behaviour.",Clues_Of_Blue,Community Member,23-12-2020,PTSD and trauma,305,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/questioning-some-things/td-p/509600

PTSD-580,"Suffering from BPD, Trauma and PTSD","I haven’t posted on here in a very long time. Basically, I’ve moved interstate which has been very challenging but refreshing at the same time. I understand how bad my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) is. That’s very clear to me and it’s something that I want to work on. Before I got here, I had been talking to this guy and when I got here we started dating, similar to my previous boyfriend, he cheated on me (but over the phone with another girl interstate) and aside from that was just mean to me and all in all didn’t really treat me the best… I’ve broken up with him about 3 times based on his actions and he keeps telling me he wants to make it work which he has proven and has sort of been working on it, but all in all it’s a lot to handle. He’s quite controlling and I guess in a way, possessive. Which I don’t mind but I do have boundaries. I just don’t know if there’s someone better out there or not and it’s freaking me out. On top of that, he keeps saying that he wants to see me open up and be free spirited and happy etc which I hear a lot from my parents as well, in fact I’ve heard that from a lot of people and it really hurts. I suffer from BPD/trauma as a result of really brutal bullying and a lot of emotional neglect, so understandably, I’m really not the easiest person to be friends with or have a relationship with. So amongst all of this “we miss the happy girl” it makes me feel really depressed because I didn’t even realise I had changed that much and then I realised, maybe I am just really sad? And maybe I just don’t care about myself? That’s why I don’t really care about how I’m treated and honestly it’s just making me feel suicidal like I just don’t have the energy to be here anymore. I have a white picket fence dream to have a family and a golden retriever because of how family oriented I am but I just don’t know if it will happen and I’m just scared about everything and also can’t be bothered with anything.

PTSD-581,I am not able to get myself back together again,"On the 6 August I left a very violent and evil person. I was in a relationship with them. I am in a court process at the moment. I cannot seem to get me or my life together again. I've stopped reaching out for help because further damage has been done by me doing that. I know I am a victim of evil cruelty. The thing is this evil cruelty has done permanent damage to my life. This evil cruelty has done damage to my brain. I feel it is not fixable, my brain that is. Its damaged skills that I had that do not feel possible anymore. I struggle to do them now. I am not only traumatised, I am horrified. I go blank as a form of protection to my mind. I'm scared of my lawyer, I am scared of court, I am scared that I am just going to sit and cry from the frustration that my mind will not work or that I have been so traumatised that I cannot talk. I do not even know what to do. I do not know who to see that can tell me what has happened to me nor what to do about it. I am in a therapy program but my therapist isn't helping. My last session I just sat and stared out the window, not there. Just stared out the window. I'm pushing everyone away from me. I want to say horrible things that enter my head but I do not say them because I talk very little now. It is like words don't come to my head or even make their way out of my mouth but inside I am screaming. I feel like I am beyond help. I am aware of things around me but they just don't mean anything or matter. I want to disappear and I do not want anyone to find me at all. Nobody wants to hear about what is going on for me. They just bring their own agenda in or there opinion of what I need to do or should be doing. Everyone including therapists treat me and the things I am going through like the elephant in the room. At that point I just want to tell everyone to get out and not ever come back. I've learnt that people are selfish when what someone else is going through creates issues for them whatever they may be, then it becomes about them and not the victim. This is what has further caused me to shut down. I have lost faith and hope in the world, in society, and I do not want to be around people anymore. I don't even want support or help because that has always come at a cost for me. I think it is fair I do not need to explain my decisions and choices to anyone anymore.",2tired,Community Member,19-10-2021,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-am-not-able-to-get-myself-back-together-again/td-p/1425
PTSD-582,Dealing with my PTSD & trauma,"Hello all, I suffer from PTSD, depression and anxiety. Even just typing this out is making me anxious but I feel like I just need someone to know how I feel. I was sexually assaulted by someone that I trusted. I felt disgusted with myself and was put in the mindset that it was all my fault. It took so long for me to open up to anyone due to my shame. It has been months now.. there are good days and today feels particularly bad. Noises still scare me so much and with lockdown and restrictions easing I feel even more scared that people will be able to be anywhere. I always feel paranoid and hyper vigilant with my surroundings. I can't deal with sounds late at night and I feel like I can still hear and see so much more compared to others. Every time someone shouts or yells outside, every time a car loudly passes by I hold my breath and feel like I am in danger. Every time a person comes up from behind me I feel very uneasy still. I'm glad my friends who know are very supportive but I just feel since this traumatic experience has only happened to me no one really understands what I've been dealing with. I've seen a therapist and a counsellor regarding this but I don't really feel like they fit for me, I don't feel like I was really heard or that they were really listening to my issues - I know you need to go to a few to find the one that suits you but just the thought of opening up again to someone new seems exhausting at the moment. I suppose I just feel so robbed? And angry? And upset? - I feel like I'm not even the person I used to be anymore. I fear social gatherings, I can't go and make new friends, I can't see myself going on dates, I have major issues trusting anyone and even when I'm hanging out with my friends I always am hyper aware of everything I say, their reactions and what I expect them to react in order to feel safe. I feel terrible every time I hang out with friends and would either have a panic or anxiety attack due to small triggers around me. Not really sure where this is going... I think I just needed to vent.

PTSD-583,Mixed emotions after mTop,"2 months ago I had a medical termination (you have pills and that causes the pregnancy to end just like a miscarriage) and I know it was the right decision for my family (2 beautiful girls already but can't afford another child right now, we live with my parents, there's 7 people in our house and the baby just wouldn't have a good life. It just wasn't the right time) um, but now I'm finding I can't be following people on social media who are pregnant and I find myself scrolling past posts about miscarriages or scrolling past pregnancy announcements. This month is infant and pregnancy loss awareness and so there's been alot of posts about it and I'm finding myself sad and full of guilt that so many people lost babies who were wanted and loved and here I am going on with my life knowing I chose to give up the baby. I suppose it doesn't help that after the termination I just moved on with my life, I didn't allow myself to grieve or even feel like I should. It wasn't until I had a dream where I broke down crying for some reason while talking to someone then said to them ""I'm sorry, it all happened so quickly and I haven't had time to grieve.""

PTSD-585,'What If ...' Questions,"Yesterday evening, I saw on the news. about how in some states in US?A are repealing laws, & making abortion illegal again, with no provision for women raped or (they said incest), but for me, that means rape, too. All the ‘what if...’ scenarios swirl, & I am tossed about like Dorothy in the tornado. If my brother had been younger, & if it had been mutual, maybe then...but it was rape. He could have impregnated me, & I might have had a baby when I was13yrs old. Abortion was illegal then, in Qld. Decades later, I went to those rallies, chanting “free abortion on demand”, years before my own history had begun to re-emerge & solidify in my head. Later still, I faced what might have been if I had become pregnant & that is so bleeping scary. From some communications with my father, I know my father thought I had been a willing participant. He did not understand. He put it down to youthful experimenting & discovery. Would he have been able to have accepted a child? Would I have been able to accept & love my, & his, child? My (ex-stepmother) would have been mortified. I doubt there could be anything more shameful to her, no blacker mark against her reputation. I would have had to go. At the least, I would have been gagged, maybe hidden away when I got big? & that's just about him... * I know, ‘what if...’ questions, like these, when I am imagining the worst scenarios is not helpful. This just drags me down. I don’t know how to play ‘What If ...’ in an uplifting way. I would like to hear from anyone with some ideas. mmMekitty",mmMekitty,Valued Contributor,12-10-2021,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/what-if-questions/td-p/15974
PTSD-586,I want to stop being angry at the bullies,"Hi all, I'm new here... I'm JJ, 36yo queer man. I need to get something off my chest and just maybe see if any of you nice people can help me with a fresh perspective. I was bullied as a child. A lot. From preschool to the end of high school. And more at university. Sometimes physically, and constantly emotionally and socially. I was ridiculed for my accent, for the way I spoke, for being bad at sports, for being intelligent and bookish, for being sensitive, for being gay (even though there's no way I was coming out while I was there. I didn't come out until well after moving away from home, I was so scared of the bullies having anything else to through at me). I would be set up to fail to provide entertainment for the group. For a long time I was the guy even the other unpopular kids would have a go at. Things slowly got better, but the damage was done. My ability to read social cues - especially around sex and relationships - was stunted and that led to a lot of anguish continuing, on and off, until now. I made some spectacularly bad relationship choices in my early 20s including a fling with a closeted man who ended up assaulting me. I have generalized anxiety disorder, depression and have worked through a lot of issues in counselling and through medication. But I still feel socially awkward and have low self esteem a lot of the time. I've learnt to accept that this is a result of the terrible way I experienced social interactions when I was just learning. I know that this isn't my fault. But it makes me angry still. I feel that I was treated so badly for so long by so many of my peers that I'm permanently damaged. And I hate that these bullies and the things they said and did still have so much power over me. I believe that through forgiveness, empathy and understanding I can move on and let go of the anger. I was even able to do this with the boyfriend who assaulted me, eventually, when he gave me a heartfelt apology. But I can't seem to do this with the high school bullies. They picked on me as a weak target, never showed remorse. They also aren't a part of my life any more, I moved to Australia from the UK after uni, my life is totally different now. But I still hate that what they did to me then still has so much power to make me feel so bad. What do you think, patient people? Can I find a way to forgive so I can try to stop living with this hanging over me? Or must we always have to carry the weight ofmour trauma?

PTSD-587,Unable to wear face mask due to PTSD and Panic reaction,"In late March 2020, I tried & could not wear a face mask. I panicked. I’m unable to wear one since. Traumatic memories and feelings came up, & now, just thinking of putting on a mask brings up those memories & feelings. Not being sociable, I thought I‘m OK with being home more. Physical limitations + psychological reactions & I want to be by myself, but I had been trying to get out, joined groups, even thought I had made a few friends. So much has changed. Now COVID-19 and restrictions, even the ‘eased’ restrictions in SE Qld still mean that masks are required indoors, in other people’s cars, public transport and crowded outdoor places. I can’t drive. I can’t be sure how far apart I am from others. I am living pretty much as if in strict lockdown. It is one thing to choose how to live, another to have this isolation forced upon me. I want to be careful; not put myself at avoidable risk. Finally got 2nd vax dose. But, that does not fully protect me from being infected & infecting others. It’s better (not 100%) at preventing severe illness, and I would be glad to never have to be in ICU, on ventilation. I wonder if I would need to be tranquilised to tolerate that? I am so angry at that abuser, (I want to swear here), because, after all these years since, I now have this! It puzzles me. I was able to go to a dentist (eventually), & I learned to deal with the panic and wanting to flee. & I had some surgery, a colonoscopy too, and I managed those, including having a mask give anaesthetic to me. But was I given something to help me relax beforehand? I can’t remember. As much as I have done to deal with past abuses and now this; unexpected. When I panicked it was perhaps even more of an impact than the original abuse, because I could withdraw into my head & feel cut off from what was happening. Impossible to do now. If I could, I would do it again to wear a mask & get on & do what I need. Yeah, I would save up my distress; feel & deal later. I have been dealing with this for year+½, yet, just thinking of putting on a face mask brings up those memories and feelings. The way things are going, I think I will live a ‘COVID-19 restricted’ life from here on until there is barely any COVID-19 around & masks no longer have to be worn. When? My community worker is away, Dr will have a break after that, & I’m feeling abandoned, not part of life, ignored & forgotten. I’m sure that’s untrue, & wonder, how many others are not able to wear masks, & feeling side-lined too?",mmMekitty,Valued Contributor,15-09-2021,PTSD and trauma,19,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/unable-to-wear-face-mask-due-to-ptsd-and-panic-reaction/td-p/33380
PTSD-588,The trauma and remedy of insulting remarks,"As a child I had no better father. My mother also however due to what I believe is undiagnosed BPD or NPD later on she became toxic so I had to remove her from my life. Back to dad. He was such a good caring and considerate man that those around him in our community held him in great regard. He was even asked to be a justice of the peace, a role he turned down. So, with my then undiagnosed bipolar, dysthymia, anxiety and depression I joined the Air Force at 17yo and went off the rails. Even though further careers included prison officer and PI I had a personal life that was chequered to say the least plus relationship issues. I reflected this morning what comments were made by others in my past that made the most negative impact. ""You'll never be a shadow of your father"" carries the deepest scar, a scar made by- yes, my mother. ""when are you going to act more like your father""...""your father never got drunk""...and ""your father would roll over in his grave if he knew how you are treating your mother"". Some comments made by my mothers friends that had ear full after ear full from her to the extent they just had to defend her. So 11 years ago, my sister and I tossed our mother out of our lives. Today we still bare the mental scars of her treachery. However, we both must have been very strong to carry out that action and stronger still to not ever regret our decision. How? Well we were provided with the ability to judge good and bad by our father and that ability to judge came to roost when we knew in our hearts that such deplorable comments were designed to cause great harm and that was - wrong! For several decades she got away with such comments because she was powerful, manipulating and wore the mask of a matriarch. At some point my sister and I knew we would never stop her havoc and we also knew that by severing ties we would lose family members also which happened. The philosophy of standing your ground when in your mind you know wrong has been thrown at you is a difficult one to accomplish. If you find yourself emotionally trapped and you do not have the inner strength to defend yourself and to implement measures to protect yourself in your future going forward, then you might well need professional assistance to do that. Far better to place shields and distance in front of an enemy that to accept the wrath of their onslaught alone. You only have one life and its too short to waste a moment on one more insulting remark. Your thoughts?

PTSD-590,Im losing the love of my life..,"I have made many mistakes over the past 12 months the biggest one being I did the worst thing possible in a relationship - being unfaithful. Something I will never forgive myself for. I have had to hold on to the guilt and the decision I made not to come forward and now I'm paying the consequences. There has been 2 occasions and one I hoped I never had to relive. January this year I was taken advantage of by someone that I classed as a mate and although I'm his eyes I may have given him the wrong impression he forced himself on me and I had no control. Gut wrenching! I never did anything about it as I was so scared and while I have had break downs over it I just wanted to forget. I dealt with this mostly in silence. Second time I made the wrong decision (my head cloudy with lots of alcohol and drugs) and I made a completely life changing decision and not in a good way. We were friends and agreed it wasn't to happen again. I have been holding onto this for nearly 6 months and I poured my heart out to my closest friends. But now it's come out and my partner has been told of my mistakes. I have hurt him so bad, he is so angry at me - swearing at me, saying I basically asked to be taken advantage of, telling me he hopes my girls never turn out like me etc. Iv lost him, and I have lost myself. I'm trying to fight for him and I'm making changes to prove I can be that girl again he loved so much. My partying ways distroyed our relationship but he was hanging on but now he can't anymore. He deserves to be angry and I deserve to cop what ever comes my way - I'm trying so hard to keep my head above water for my two beautiful girls and each day is a battle.

PTSD-591,Coping with PTSD after open heart surgery at 23,"Almost 2 years ago I had open heart surgery to replace my aortic valve with a cows valve. I was 23 at the time. I was born with a bad valve and had surgery at 5 days old to repair it but I can’t remember that one obviously. I always knew I would need the valve replaced when I was older but it didn’t make it any easier. When I went in for surgery something went wrong and I nearly died, they tried to get my heart started again 2 times and then eventually got it going with a balloon pump. Later down the track I found out that they almost put me on an artificial heart machine which means a heart transplant. after the surgery I was put in an induced coma for 24 hours and then recovery began. I have never been in so much pain, my chest had been sawed open and my ribs broken. Everyone around me in the ICU was 70 or older and looked to be dying. I have always suffered with anxiety from a father with anger issues and being bullied at school and other heart problems but in ICU at one stage I felt so strongly that I couldn’t breathe that I almost considered trying to walk out of the hospital just to make them see how panicked I was. Come say 5 I started to get some relief but then for a month at home I slept sitting up and was in 10/10 pain all the time. eventually my body healed and I think everyone was really surprised at how quickly I was out and about. I then fell into really self destructive behaviour. My boyfriend at the time had cheated on me about a week before surgery so I didn’t really care about my actions at the time and would drink and party I guess without knowing suppressing my feelings. my sister is also an ice addict and went back to it while I was in hospital and then verbally abused me and left the week I got out and didn’t come back for 8 months (at the time I felt like she would never come back and would OD so was processing that too) about 4 months after the surgery I would have break downs and visions of being in ICU and also my sister leaving and would just cry alone and think how could anyone understand. Later down the track I discovered it was ptsd and went to see someone which really helped about 4 months ago I found out I will need open heart surgery again in June this year because the valve isn’t working right. I’m so scared I won’t be so lucky this time. It’s on my mind all the time especially before I sleep. Has anyone experienced this?

He is trying to say it will change and he will not let me go. Throughout this 12 years there has been a lot of pain and stressful times. I was 22 when I was pregnant he was 19 then turned 20. I have always been sorry for things in our rs and felt as though I have destroyed what could’ve always been for him. He said that also being so young he has lost a lot over the years. I wanted to get married straight away. He was against marriage as his father is a pastor and his mum and dad seperate all the time!! We’ve practically counselled their rs through about 10 years of ups and downs. I have been through domestic violence through shouting, financial abuse, no friends, grabbing, emotional abuse and no mental support. Then the ptsd is there as he flips and goes really well for a while but we end up back in the same spot. There has been various times I have said I’m going to leave and he convinces me otherwise or shuts me down and says no your not leaving. This has now broken me.I have had a few mental depression episodes and feel like I have completely given up. I have seen our children get in between our arguments, our children scared, our daughters anger and sadness has completely taken over her too. But if I leave, I’m hurting my children and breaking up my family. 3 weeks ago I decided that was it and applied for a house through a friend and actually got it! I felt relieved and that fate had finally appeared for me. That I can finally feel free and try be myself and not depressed. I told him and now he has absolutely love bombed me with flowers, crying, promises of change and that he loves me like no other. I have been through this so many times. He says it’s different this time but it’s so hard to believe. He gets explosive anger because my reasonings aren’t enough and I’m just giving up on our rs and our children. While I think this is the best thing for everyone he is so so stuck on that it’s not the best. He has also said because of my mental illness that I am not going to make it on my own, that the children will be worse off. How do I leave when I don’t get my keys until 4 weeks!!??

After about an hour of riding I found myself on a nice isolated stretch of windy road when my rear breaks failed and I was forced to make a decision of extremes, lay my bike down and crash on the road or continue off the road and into a bushy ravine off the side of the road I chose to lay my bike down and crash. after sliding along the road for a short while myself and the bike came to a halt it was at this stage I became aware I’d caused myself some major damage destroying my knee and breaking my shoulder, however it quickly became apparent that I was still In a dangerous predicament laying in the middle of the road on a blind corner. Running purely on adrenaline, panic and fear I managed to drag myself to the edge of the road and after laying there crying for a minute or 2 I found my phone and called 000, it was 15-20 terrifying and hopelessly lonely minutes before a passer by found me and helped the ambulance locate me but not before another 15-20 minutes had passed. now since the accident physically I have been repaired and my body is slowly on the mend with patience, hard work and a lot of physio I should get back to almost 100%. however mentally and emotionally I have been struggling when talking to acquaintances I give the broad strokes and try not to go into to much detail to avoid bringing up the emotions that i’m struggling with so much, I have tried talking about it with those close to me reflecting on the fear and the hopelessness I faced as I laid there on the side of the road crying out for help knowing nobody could hear me. But it hasn’t helped and I’m regularly brought to tears when I randomly think about it or something jolts it back into my mind and I just don’t know what to do or who to seek help from as I’ve never dealt with something like this before. any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",TheCustomer,Community Member,29-09-2021,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/dealing-with-motorcycle-accident/td-p/17727
PTSD-594,Difficulty pin-pointing a trigger,"Hi Haven't been here for a while. Generally I am doing OK. Healing. I started the journey about a year ago thinking my issues were just due a 'simple' social anxiety. But with digging around, reading, talking to psychologist, then psychiatrist, I got diagnosed with PTSD (and CPTSD) and referenced to clinical psychologist for therapy - some things I didn't realise affected me so much, some things I thought I forgot but now sometimes they pop up in my head out of the blue. And it appears there was much more, complex and harmful stuff. But generally now I am able to recognize some of my triggers. Sometimes it is immediate realisation, that I fell in the whirlpool of flashback. Sometimes it takes couple of days. In many cases I understand where they come from, sometimes I know exactly what was the event back then. I know what caused me often feeling betrayed and distrustful, or why I fear rejection, or why dissociating panic kicks in at slightest sign of being physically overpowered. And in most cases I know my reaction is disproportionate to what is really happening, and making sure consciously that I am actually safe, and knowing that this and that happened in the past helps me a lot to 'return' to present. Sometimes it just this 'Yup, it was trigger, I'm in flashback' is enough. Sometimes it takes couple of days to normalise. But the only thing that 'haunts' me is overbearing fear of loss. I know people come and go. Everyone has a choice after all. But anything that relates to someone's death, e.g. parent losing a child, or child losing parent, loss of loved ones due to accident, disaster, war, act of terrorism. It triggers physical pain, I feel disconnecting (lightheaded), helpless and hopeless, and want to completely avoid the thought. I have similar reaction when it comes to women discrimination. But here I know where it comes from, and I am actively working on my own empowerment. But about the loss, I am unable to grasp it. I can't remember experiencing anything that made me feel this way, though I have reacted always like this way since I was a kid. Somehow not being able to pin-point it to a specific event feels like a barrier in healing, because it typically moves an avalanche of unwelcomed thoughts and memories, and pretty much triggers a whole spectrum of pain, shame, guilt, anger and resentment. Sorry for a bit of a rant. I just needed to get it out of my chest. G.",gucia6,Community Member,22-09-2021,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/difficulty-pin-pointing-a-trigger/td-p/33968

He has always had extreme lows, where he becomes very quiet & this can last for days. He tells me that nothing is wrong, and that he’s just “being quiet”. During those frequent “quiet” episodes, he would not engage in even general conversation& this was confusing for me. However, out of the blue last week, he is being extremely verbally abusive towards me ~ his behaviour is totally uncharacteristic. His voice changes and his eyes glaze over. He is saying some very nasty things and making things up. Believes I have hacked into his accounts, I’m having an affair & stealing his belongings. He has gone from a quiet, loving, gentle & kind person to this absolute monster. He’s saying things he wouldn’t ever dream of. I can only marry up the timing with a visit with his mother, who is currently very ill , dysfunctional family & never really grieving over the death of his father, 4 years ago. im beside myself with worry - he won’t talk to me unless he’s abusing me, so I am now keeping out of his way, which is torture in my own home. He tells me I’m the reason he is how he is. I’ve tiptoed around the suggestion for him to go & talk to someone, but I’m told that I’m the crazy one. im so sad - it feels like I’ve lost my partner! He really is unwell & im scared that he won’t get help and I’ll lose him forever.",Judy H,Community Member,25-09-2021,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/partner-won-t-get-help/td-p/8582
PTSD-596,Is closure necessary?,"A few years ago a friend of mine raped me. There was a lot of alcohol and drugs involved, and shorty after the incident he went to rehab for several months. I broke ties with him, his friend and family who I was really close to. He contacted me when he got back from rehab as if nothing had happened. I had been going through so much trauma, and still am amongst many other mental health difficulties and wonder if he really knows what happened? There is a fine line between consent, it took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that it was rape. How can he think pushing himself on me when I was throwing up, crying and saying no over and over... I told him I just wanted to go home. His family is extremely wealthy and well known in our community, perhaps a part of me wanted to protect him and them... I dont know why, because years later I still hold so much pain with me and have flash backs weekly. It feels unfair! So my question is, should I reach out to him? his family? Is it even worth it... He ignores me on facebook when I have tried in the past...

PTSD-597,incapable of moving on?,"Hi all, Not quite sure what I’m hoping to achieve by posting here. Recently I’ve found that I have been constantly thinking about past traumas. I thought I was beginning to move on with my life and become happier, but lately every spare moment is spent thinking about my past. I have had three bouts of therapy throughout my life to no real avail and I don’t particularly find it helpful. I’ve meditated, picked up hobbies, talked with family/friends, confronted some issues, tried to resolve others… yet nothing seems to help me heal. I’m unsure where to go from here. Will I ever be able to move on? Have I just not had a good therapist? Am I doomed to be miserable my entire life? Maybe hearing from others similar experiences would help. Has anyone else felt like they would never be able to move on? thanks",ajm2570,Community Member,21-09-2021,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/incapable-of-moving-on/td-p/48337

My mother is extremely manipulative and has a postion of power where she works she has fired so many people and does not care about there well being. Now with what is going on in Sydney I really feel absolutely panicked because most people do NOT know what it is to live with a person without conscience. I cannot take this anymore.

PTSD-600,Confronting emotionally abusive ex-husband,"Hello, I would like some advice on why I might be feeling as I am feeling. I left my marriage 3 years ago and see it as 'finally getting out'. It was never an easy relationship and over 10 years, there were regular destructive patterns. Every year, my husband would spiral down into a deep depression-like mode of being and usually it would end up with me taking the brunt of it. I believe that we had an unhealthy anxious-avoidant relationship with him tending towards dismissive avoidance and me being anxiously attached. Every year, he threatened me with abandonment, either by telling me to get out or saying that he had the divorce papers ready, even only months after our wedding. He threatened to cut me off from our bank account, told me he would rip me apart in counselling, called me a little girl who wouldn't be able to look after herself, gaslit me when he started an emotional affair with a co-worker, threatened suicide and told me that I was the cause for his trauma. When I moved out, I felt incredible relief and never looked back. It was very hard to get to that point where I had enough pain to leave, especially because I thought I loved him and the good times were deceiving. I have since seen a psychologist who assisted me in understanding that a lot of this behaviour could be considered emotional abuse / coercive control through emotional control. I am currently not having a great time due to other reasons and I have, over the past months, realised how much this marriage aggravated my attachment concerns, especially my tendency to put others' needs forward and suppress mine, be hyper-vigilant to read the room for negative emotional responses and strongly fear abandonment and rejection. So today, I chose to confront my ex-husband by sending him an email letting him know that I want all subtle contact to end (he still gave me cards and occasionally messaged, which I did not really care for). I also told him the reason and gave him several examples which I started with ""it is not ok to..."" and then the example of what he did. I blocked him on all avenues because he tried to spam me with a response via FB, text, Whatsapp..I am safe. Initially, I felt great and like I finally released this. But right now, I feel as if I did something wrong. I do not understand that feeling because I think I had the right to say what was not ok for me and I have the right to block a person from my life. Can someone please help me understand? Is this learned behaviour?",ReeCar123,Community Member,08-09-2021,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/confronting-emotionally-abusive-ex-husband/td-p/25315

I did alot of reckless shit in the aftermath of this destroyed my schooling fell out with my siblings and parents even friends.

Currently under treatment of Psychologist and Psychiatrist but have found that there is only so much talking I can do and take on board. Being in the hole and trying to climb out is bloody hard and with everyone giving advice its all just overwhelming. So far I've lost a marriage, a new relationship and I'm close to losing the bond with my children. The kids can see me falling apart and they can sense its a struggle for me to show them the affection they deserve - I know its wrong, but it all feels like a chore trying to put on that brave face and pretend I'm ok. My parents have an understanding, but as much as they are trying to help, once again its the feeling of being overwhelmed with advice and concern. As stated earlier, I do appreciate everyone in my circle trying to help, but there is only so much talking a person can do before it gets too much. As much as its not good, I've found myself disconnected from everyone. On one hand its needed but also I know its not the better thing to do. Its been six weeks now and I still have no real way forward - its almost a sense of comfort being away.

PTSD-606,My new anti-depressant makes me less anxious but I have to rest more,"Hi, My new anti-depressant is working better. I no longer feel anxious and like i HAVE to do something or people will think i am weird for being inside too much. I feel better so I am grateful. I also feel less angry. I was taking another antidepressant and it was making me anxious and more angry. THere is something that I do though and i am doing it more. It is not self harm it is part of my ocd. I have body dysmorphic disorder and part of that is grooming or skin picking the other part is distortion of my physical appearance so with this new antidepressant i am free of the physcial appearance distorion and that bothers me SO MUCH MORE it is torture. If i have dead skin on my feet I pick it. And I try to only remove the dead skin but sometimes i go too far*not often) but it's like with a hangnail and then i feel sad because it hurts. I have told someone about this and read about it and I was doing it with the last antidepressant but i am more aware now than i was when I was taking my previous medication. I am on another medication and I feel bad that I have the urge to fix the dead skin on my feet but i know this is ocd. I have never bled or anything from removing the dead skin but last night I took off a piece that was too close to the good skin. It is the same as when you bite your cuticles and you think you ae taking a hangnail off but then you take too much off. ANyway. At least I don't feel anxious-well obviously if i have ocd I still feel a little anxious but nothing like when i was on the other antidepressant. I feel calm and not caring so much what other people think. And my body dysmorphic disorder is much better. THat was really torturing me if you look at my other posts. I was really distorting my appearance on my medications together. I read an email to my friend that was so bizarre i thought i looked like someone who I have nothing in common with-but that is becaus eof something my mother said to me when i was little and my mind distorted it. I am very creative LOL! ANyway this is good news even though some of you are probably thinking that removing dead skin from my feet is gross. I remember when I was little my mother did that and i thought it was the most disgusting thing i had seen. And now I am doing it. Also my father bites his cuticles so I guess it runs in the family. But i did not do it when I was five. And i only do it when I get callouses.

PTSD-607,Toxic behaviours and wanting to fix them,"Hi everyone, I have recognised some toxic behaviours in myself that I’d really like to try and stop as it harms my relationships with others. Ive been with my current boyfriend about a month, we haven’t been able to see eachother due to lockdown. I realised that frequently I will put my problems on him and expect him to know how to respond and help, and get angry if he doesn’t. I really dislike that I do this. For example, I was telling him that I don’t want to eat breakfast or lunch since I had McDonald’s last night and he wasn’t sure how to respond. I got mad at him for how he responded even though he wasn’t trying to harm me and I shouldn’t have put that problem on him in the first place. I also notice that I sometimes do things just to get attention from others. I think my biggest problem is getting mad at people for small things, I lost my best friend because we hadn’t talked for a few weeks and she replaced me with another girl. I got angry at her instead of talking it out. I feel as if I don’t really care for others as much as I do myself, and I don’t like that. I have been diagnosed with Autism, complex PTSD & anxiety.

PTSD-609,PTSD behaviours,"About 6 months ago, a really toxic person moved out of my house. He wasn't paying rent on time which was the main reason he was asked to leave, but the other reason was that he was emotionally manipulative. He didn't hit anyone, but he would blow up if something small wasn't done his way. It got to the point where we weren't allowed to drink water from a tap if he was asleep. He literally turned off the water because we had woken him up with it. If there were dishes in the sink he would slam doors, or storm off. On more than one occasion he ran off and threatened to harm himself. It honestly feels like such a long time ago, but still it feels like I'm still scared by him. I still jump if a door is closed a little too hard. Today, one of my housemates left the house and my first thought was ""oh god, what did I forget to do?"", and the first thing I wanted to do was text that housemate to check what I did wrong. I thought I was past all of these behaviours. I still get a little weird about turning on taps too late. My psychologist basically told me to practice exposure therapy. Turn on some taps, or leave dishes in the sink. But doors closing, particularly the front door (which is especially loud most of the time), is really hard for me. I don't know if I'm really looking for advice, but I just wanted to tell my story and not feel completely crazy for being scared of things like doors closing. Am I alone?

PTSD-613,Can you have PTSD twice in your lifetime.,"First, PTSD was when I was 5 years old from my mothers' brother, and my grandmother's next-door neighbour kept my silence until I was 22 had seen a psychologist from the age of 6 because my mother thought I was having pal mal seizures. But they were nothing of the sort. So I did not tell her, just I was frightened of what might happen to her. The abuse went on until I was 8. I could not complete state school because of a nervous breakdown, so in grade 6 was transferred to a special school, so my lack of education cost me a great deal in self-esteem. The second PTSD was when I was 42 years old.

PTSD-617,Will seeing someone ACTUALLY help?,"Hi everyone, it has taken me many years to realise that my childhood was filled with daily sexual abuse from my older siblings. From when I started kindergarten to when I left home, it was normal behaviour and just what I was meant to do. My parents found out about it when I still in primary school, because i got very sick. I was told that I wasn’t old enough for that yet. So a year later when I was older it started again. It has affected me everyday, I still blame myself, even though logically I know it is not my fault. I have never shared my story, I guess I think people would agree it is my fault. There is a free service near me that provides counseling to survivors of sexual abuse. I keep hesitating to reach out to them though. Would it actually help me to stop thinking about the abuse and blaming myself? Most days I hate myself and what has happened, I keep blaming myself. I have extremely severe depression and extremely severe anxiety and I see a counsellor for that but I don’t know if I am going to get better unless I deal with my childhood.

PTSD-618,Different reactions to different traumas,"Hi all I’ve recently discovered that perhaps some things I dealt with as a child and how I was raised have had a massive impact on how I behave in relationships. How close or open or intimate I can allow myself to be before withdrawing and isolating myself because I’m scared, I’m not good at being vulnerable. As I read through some of these posts and learn about trauma and PTSD my dealings seem somewhat insignificant in comparison to what others have dealt with. Do you think that people out there can have such different reactions and feel things so differently based on the event? And some people recover easily and move on and others find it harder?

PTSD-620,Making a change for someone who's miles away,"Hi all, I need some advice. I've been in a long-distance relationship with a girl living in the US for about 3 months now. We both love each other very much and can depend on each other. However, as of late things have become much more concerning for me. This girl lives in an abusive family, physically and mentally, and it's beginning to have an extreme toll on her mental health. The main offender is her mother, who's had three children including her (that I know of) with a fourth on the way. For so long this woman has done so much to harm her. She's neglected her, played favourites with her younger brother and, in the worst cases, physically assaulted her for almost no reason. I can elaborate on some things if need be, but that's about the gist of it. I've done so much to try and help her, living in Australia, yet it's beginning to fall flat. My ultimate goal is to get her to a place where she's able to live without having to worry about not being treated right, where she doesn't have to hole herself up in her room in order to avoid being yelled at for nothing. I've urged her to call the police and yet her family lies in order to save their own skin. I've given her hotlines to call and I'm not sure if she's contacted any of them. I genuinely don't know what to do anymore, but I don't want to leave her to fend for herself. She's very unstable mentally and I'm worried something bad will happen if I don't do something soon.

PTSD-621,"4 years of PTSD, Depression and Chronic Pain after being attacked at work","So this stage of my life is a new experience for me. Used to take care of others, never asked for help for myself. Find this difficult to be open & vulnerable. Everybody's rock. Single mum 3 kids & extras. Primary carer both parents. Disability worker. Attacked at work by client (after going to help coworker); caused soft tissue injuries, broken bones, detached retina, spinal nerve damage, massive weight gain... Literally had to learn to walk again. Now suffer chronic pain, nerve pain, falls due to balance issues, muscle spasms & tremors, cervicogenic headaches (migraine on steroids - stimulation eg light, noise, clothes... all painful), ocular migraines (temp loss of vision), nightmares, depression, grief & ptsd. ANGRY. There's more but thats enough negative. I lived to dance, paint, garden, read and cook. I loved & lived life to the fullest, always busy. Now I can barely walk. Chances of making it back to the dance floor - not. I chair dance on my rare good days. Although I can't stand the noise from the music. I'll never cook again. - blending flavours, creating visual appeal and taste; totally lost knife skills; painting fairyland or dolphin/undersea murals was my release from life's stress. gardening is another lost skill - can't do bonsai safely anymore, nor can I cope with the demands of maintaining a decent garden. Reading is slowly coming back - I can read short stories again sometimes. I keep notes of characters & plot line, so I don't I forget and lose understanding. There is so much of my life I have lost. Pet peeve - general public's belief that they have the ""right"" to know my life story. I'm not some freaking reality TV show for their entertainment. Yes there is a horrifying story about intrusion beyond social acceptability behind this issue. I was actually chased into the toilets by someone who felt that it was their right to know my story. I have changed from a very social person to complete self-isolation. I talk to my medical team & 1 friend who wouldn't let me cut them out of my life, no matter how hard I tried. So do I have a life? NO! I exist. But I am slowly (4 years now) coming to terms with this new ""life"". Have I considered ending it all? Several times, but couldn't do that to my kids - the life-sentence of grief and guilt they would feel stops me every time. So now its time to learn how to start living again - maybe not how I had planned, but that's life.

PTSD-622,Too repressed to ever have a relationship? (TW),"Over the course of my life, either as a result of what I was exposed to, or what I exposed my self to in coping with it, I've locked away all notion of sex/sexuality in a box labeled ""do not touch."" It kept me safe when my only sexual/romantic relationships were detrimental. But now I'm 18. I'm an adult that hasn't kissed since 13 - if we're even counting that. I heard a peer talk about crushes and dating, and it reminded me that other people still feel that. A special type of joy, nervous butterflies, holding someone's hand. THings that feel childish and unsafe simultaneously. Things that feel like they will never be mine again. I'm at a place that is still too afraid to even conceptualise myself being viewed in a sexual/romantic way, but this small voice, the young romantic I once was, yearns for it. And it sucks because I should have spent my teen years experimenting with ""love"" and crushes and sexuality.

PTSD-623,Living with abusive alcoholic father,"Hi all, I have a previous thread I wrote a thread in relation to my deep hatred for my father. I am here again in the midst of lockdowns, I am not coping with living with my father who is abusive and alcoholic. Throughout my entire life he has led an extremely toxic lifestyle. One of alcoholism, gambling addiction, smoking, physically abusive towards his children, emotional affairs on my mother. I have been a victim of violent and physical abuse which ended when I was an early adult. Nonetheless, to this day he posses all other toxic traits I listed above. I believe his excessive drinking is causing increasing damage to his brain. He is distant, does not care to engage in conversation with myself or my mother, sleeps throughout the day and only wakes up to eat or sit around with his lone company. He is not interested in anything else. I cannot tolerate living with this man who has abused me my entire life and now during lockdown, I face him every day. He is like living with a filthy animal. He drinks so much that it causes him to make these burp/groans all throughout the day. It sounds like a yell, it is so loud that neighbours can hear and it is clockwork. I know it sounds ridiculous but I am so ashamed. He literally spits his spit around the garden and leaves his pile of dirty dishes in the sink. He is a filthy person. The house is old and run down and he won't fix anything as he is lazy and spends his money on abusive substances. I have started to notice signs of PTSD. I startled when I see him unexpectedly around the house and I anticipate his verbal abuse or his burps/groans and spits at any given time. He is such a physical stressor for me and my body responds with heighten blood pressure, anxiety, increased heart rate and implosion of anger. In the most extreme response, I begin thinking about how I wished he was dead. I know that's extreme but that's level of hatred I have. He cannot be spoken to or he will respond with verbal abuse. I have a plan to move out eventually, but during lockdowns I cannot cope. I already lock myself in my room all day and its not enough to tame mental health.

I had the word Penis sign put back of my hoodie. I have been subjected severe gaslighting where I was treated like a puppet by everyone and questioned my sanity and I couldn't ask for help or assistance in a Corporate environment. Sadly, I brought home that toxicity and it has destroyed my relationship with my family. I saw all of the EAPs and Psychologist but nothing was done and I tried to compromise with them through mediation as in my employer but they would not agree to it as I was trying to put in a complaint against the sex discrimination act but nothing was done and a settlement was not reached.

I am at a loss and comcare rejected my claim despite showing some evidence and most of the evidence is with the Department sadly, they got away with it and HR and HSRs and Harassment Contact officers were all useless nothing more tittles.

PTSD-626,DO WE CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO CARE FOR US?,"Hi everyone The most recent time I was in a situation requiring medical care, I thought a lot about the excellent people looking after me. The along comes Covid, which appears to have established a whole new set of pressures on many care professionals - from health workers, police, teachers and so on. We hear daily about the pressures they face. These care groups now often have to demonstrate flexibility and resilience far beyond what they ever thought would be required of them when they choose their profession. Like Police manning Covid traffic check points, breaking up banned Covid parties, hospital staff doing double shifts and dealing with relatives who cannot talk with infected family, and now teachers who have to deal with parents and students about Covid prevention measures. Its a real handful and difficult to solve, when you stop and think about it. Some of us have already required long term care or one type or another, we love our carers and highly value what they do for us. I'm not sure if I am allowed to say this on our forum, but some carers are facing new pressures that are almost 'bullying' from patients. Wouldn't a 'Care for the carers' campaign be a great idea! They are absolutely amazing people and have our interests front and centre! What do you think forum community - do you think carers get the love and respect they deserve? Do you have examples of amazing carers going the extra mile for you? Thanks so much for reading - I look forward to your views.

I said ok (I have a double bed there's plenty of room) but after a bit he started touching me so I moved his hand away a number of times and then he just kept going. I kept moving his hands and shifting away - I even got up to check my phone and came back to sleep well away from him (I almost fell off the side) but eventually I had to get up and leave. He eventually got up and went to his own room after he noticed I was on the couch. In the morning he said he didn't remember anything and thanked me for being there for him. I still haven't told him what he did and it's been like 6 months.

PTSD-628,I don't understand my trauma.,"Hello, I was diagnosed with PTSD a little over a year ago with comorbid MDD. One of the ways I deal with my trauma is through writing. I try writing down what I think happened. Despite being a ""victim of CSA"" I don't think my trauma was around that but because of an extremely neglectful and abusive home life. When I try to process what happened over years, and compare it to present reality, none of it seems real, as though it is just a story full of plot holes. Things that I think made sense don't, events don't line up. I remember it all like it was yesterday, but it feels like a movie. Obviously reality is not a movie, which calls into question the legitimacy of my trauma. Did things happen as I think they did? Is it just a series of events that I exaggerated in my head? Was any of it real? If it wasn't real, why do I feel this way? How can I determine what did happen, if what I think happened doesn't make sense? When two conflicting, contradicting memories exist, which one is real? If my existence is defined by this trauma, and the trauma isn't real, then what does that mean for me? How have others verified their abuse when no one else saw it?",Echtis,Community Member,12-08-2021,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-don-t-understand-my-trauma/td-p/30653

I don't know why but now I keep checking my emails constantly fearing that they would email me because they still have my email address. Ive been having panic attacks recently because my previous job just cant exit my mind, just seeing someone totally random that has the same name as my manager scares me so much.

PTSD-630,Supporting a PTSD sufferer and partner who is violent,"I will try keep this short. My long term boyfriend is a good person, with good values but is frequently violent. I know he has been diagnosed with PTSD (and possible borderline personality disorder). He has severe anxiety at times, as well as a range of other physical health conditions (cardiac, diabetes). He does NOT drink or take (illegal) drugs. The violence could be worse, but it is very frequent. Usually punching me hard in the arms or shoulders (not face or torso) or some times in the back of the head (but not with the same full swing force he would use on my arms). Sometimes there is other stuff, such as kicking my legs or pulling my hair. It usually comes in short bursts but daily. He is rarely remorseful because he believes he is retaliating for my disrespectful behaviour. However he is very sensitive to rejection, and so if he is not feeling well sometimes ""disrespectful behaviour"" is not immediately stopping whatever I am doing when he speaks. He has seen psychologists from time to time, but certainly does not ever allude to having ""anger issues"". He is absolutely opposed to us seeking help together, and sees any suggestion of us (or me) seeing a psychologist as a threat. When things get really bad, I have threatened to leave, which just increases his anxiety and makes things worse. I have never told a single person in my real life about any of this. A stranger once made a report to Police (via number plate) after he lost his cool whilst in the car (traffic jams also trigger his anxiety) but he just denied anything had happened and that was the end of the matter. He is not working and is not in a strong financial position, and this adds to his stress. He is trying to pursue some artistic endeavours and feels I do not spend enough time helping him with his work. The other night, he punched me in the shoulder/back from behind, but I was facing a cupboard door, so now have bruising around my eye and eyebrow and pain as my face hit the door. This was not because he hit me any harder than usual (so was an accident in some respects) but I have been having nightmares about other ""accidents"" happening. I want to try and get him help so we can have a healthier relationship. I expect some people will say ""leave"", but hoping someone who has come out the other side of something like this could assist.

I'm terrified that if I go to a doctor, I would be deemed to not have 'capacity' to refuse treatments/exams requiring me to be unclothed.

In January 2020 I witnessed a man commit suicide. Only my father knew about what I saw, I have tried to forget that sight, but recently I have been having nightmares about it, and the worst one was last night, because his body became that of my dad. My dad passed in September 2020, and I found him in his bed, it was unexpected, and has destroyed me, but one thing I remember is that his eyes were closed, and his face did not look in any pain, but in the nightmares dad's eyes are open and he looks so sad and hurt. I cannot take seeing these images of him that way, I will tell her about these nightmares in my next session.

But I think these nightmares are dad trying to tell me, see, I have been staying in hotels recently to avoid dad's home, and on Friday night I sat in the cold dark outside on the balcony for about half an hour, thinking of everything. I know dad would be so sad to know how much pain I am in, I feel guilty, as if I am still a burden to him now, and he cannot find his peace, in one dream I was hiding something from dad, and he was angry and stopped talking to me, maybe he is angry at my thoughts.

I feel like I need to share whats happened to me and ask for help. Trigger warning: I talk about a man who has sexually assaulted me I was sexually assaulted a couple of times by the same person, someone I used to work with.

He no longer works at the same place, my bosses asked him to leave. I feel like I need convincing that he assaulted me.

I have been seeing a psychologist and told her and my GP. I have been approved for VS counselling. But I feel like I need more support. I am feeling so depressed and anxious. I have started SH too. Which I haven't told anyone yet. I am feeling so angry at him, at the impact its having on my life and mental health. I am angry that none of what happened has to affect him. I often see him at his new work or his girlfriend around the area as we live in is close. Its so hard to see and know that his girlfriend probably has no idea. I am too scared at this stage to report to police because I am scared that he will lie, turn it on me, or say things like I wanted it to happen. Please help, any advice is appreciated.

PTSD-640,T.W. Sexual Assault - seeking advice 💞,"Hi everyone, I was sexually assaulted in 2019 by someone that I was really close friends with. Nobody in my group really liked him but I was always really nice to him because he would tell me that he was upset about not having friends and that he was feeling really left out. I had a free house and I invited him and some of my other mates over for drinks. I got really drunk and one of my friends put me to bed. I woke up to him opening the door to my room and I remember he came and laid next to me and then proceeded to get on top of me. I was so drunk I couldn’t move and I kept asking him to stop, telling him I was too drunk and saying no and that I didn’t want to have sex with him. I was so drunk that I was in and out of consciousness the whole time and barely remember anything. After that he continued to message me saying that I said yes and that I consented and saying that it was okay because he was drunk too. He convinced me that it was my fault and that I just didn’t properly remember saying yes because I was too drunk. I’m having difficulty getting through it and it was almost 2 years ago. I haven’t been able to be in a relationship with anyone since and it effects my sex life. I’ve tried contacting SARC but they can’t get me in for 6 months. I want to go to the police but I’m scared. Had anyone had a good experience with going to the police and reporting it? Just looking for some advice on how to move on because I’m so scared and depressed. He also goes to my school so i have to see him everyday and his younger brother is really close with mine. Any advice is appreciated 🥰",destlomby,Community Member,17-05-2021,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/t-w-sexual-assault-seeking-advice/td-p/21279
PTSD-641,Poetry to deal with PTSD triggers,"Hi, First time poster here. It's the eve of my birthday, I'm in lockdown, live alone and have had a week of being triggered for a multitude of reasons. Having been in therapy on and off for years, I am picking up more and more tools to help deal with the dark moments and more often than not (these days) cope well and manage triggers as opposed to acting out on them. I don't consider my writing good, have no idea where the words came from, but it feels better verbally dribbling them on a page. Can anyone relate? HIDE The pain is there, beneath the surface; You blink and a crack shows; Quick! Hide it, make a joke, Don't falter! ""You look sad"" they'll say; Laugh it off, deflect, dismiss; Just don't let it show! You'll go home, alone. You'll cry, you'll break; The wound will bleed, the pain is there; You'll sob until you're numb; Then you'll sleep. Morning comes. You look in the mirror, the pain is there; It's in your eyes, on your face and in your general demeanor; Hide it! Make-up, humor, anything. Don't let them see! They won't understand. No-one does. They never have. They never will. You'll smile and crack a joke as you arrive at work; ""You look happy"" they'll say; You'll wink, crack another joke and get to work. You'll go home, alone. You'll cry, you'll break; The wound will bleed, the pain is there; You'll sob until you're numb; Then you'll sleep.

PTSD-643,Trauma from an abusive relationship & I think I have PTSD?,"Hi, 6 weeks ago, my ex walked out on me. We've been having some arguments and internal pressures in the lead up to it. The reason why I believe I have PTSD is from the way he left me, as he left me with a packed car and said to me ""I don't want this anymore, I want to go and find someone new and something new. Please let me go"". I didn't see the way he was going to leave me coming, as I wanted us to sit down and talk about it. Come to the conclusion together it wasn't working out anymore. That night has reoccured in nightmares and flashbacks for me which has made me feel anxious even at work. Our relationship was abusive in a way where he: -Financialy Abused Me -Emotionally Abused Me -Domestic Violence - Manipulation - Gaslighting Since he left me, I keep asking if we can be friends but he has rejected this multiple times and even says he doesn't think we can be friends. I still care about him, even though he makes me feel unworthy, even as a friend.

PTSD-645,Impossible to Forgive?,"Hello fellow members, Writing here today as I feel I'm unable to forgive what's been done to me in the past. This may get rambly, I apologize in advance. Firstly, a little background. While growing up I was abused by both of my parents, mainly through verbal abuse and emotional manipulation. My siblings also began to exhibit the same behaviour, I was heading the same way, until I realised it wasn't normal. I'm sure I still exhibit some poor behaviours. About seven years ago I cut all contact with them. I now have no contact with any biological family members. My family on one parents side were cut out of my life when I was a child. The other side of the family was cut out of my life as a teen, after two deaths in that side of the family. While it shocks some people when I tell them about it, I feel having no contact with my family is best for my mental health. As a side note, I don't feel trying to contact extended family is a good idea, as any correspondence will get back to my parents. After my parents separated, they went back to their siblings and parents, bridging that gap that was put in place. At that point I was already starting to cut out my parents, leading me to ignore their attempts to connect me with extended family. After everything that's happened to me, I don't feel like I can forgive my immediate family for their actions. I can still clearly remember some of the things that were said to me, and how they treated me. For example, I was left alone in the house all day on my sixth birthday. I don't have any memories earlier than that point, which scares me. At around eight, I was told that I was viewed as the family slave. My mother even said ""why else do you think we had you?"" when I got upset about it. After that I was outright treated as the family slave, with my siblings hurling expletive's at me if I didn't do the dishes when they wanted me to. There's a lot of other things that happened that I won't cover here, as it'll take me over the character limit for starters. Additionally, I wanted to provide some background to help give anyone reading this a better idea of my situation. I would feel more inclined to forgive them if they proved they'd changed, which hasn't happened. People are frequently told to forgive others, but in this case I don't think I can do it. Am I trying to force this too early, or are there just some things can't can't be forgiven? Thank you to anyone who read through this post.

PTSD-646,In laws issues,"Have had 14 yrs problems with my in laws. Notably mil and fil. I have no parents as mine died a long time ago when I was younger. I am essentially alone. Having met husband and dated for a while, he moved into my flat and we lived there for a while. I sold my flat and we headed to his home town. There I bought a house which I put into both our names. Fast forward four years. I was drug raped. No one believed me. Especially mil. Mil informed me that I must go back to where I came from and husband will be ""fine in the house without you"" (That I paid for). I go back to my home town. Husband follows me. We sell house. We rent. Eventually husband finds problems with his jobs. A regular occurrence and a lot of job hopping he does. We decide to move to a coastal town. We rent. Mil and fil decide to visit for Christmas. All our belongings were in storage. Visit was ok. Husband and I paid for everything. Then husband's job going badly so we have to move again. This time we stay in the place for a few years. Mil and fil visit again for Christmas. Mil rings Prior to visit. She asks if I have all my belongings with me. They stay with us in our home. Husband goes back to work after Christmas. All ok until then. They got me on my own, fil said ""where are your valuables!"" Very aggressively. I said I had given them to my cousin for safekeeping. A lie. I had hidden them away. They stayed for 5 weeks. During which time they made many trips with laden bags to the local op shop that I volunteered in. I was so busy cleaning and cooking for them that I had to cancel my volunteer Work whilst they were there. i did not realise that it was strange that they were donating things to the op shop when they were guests in our home. What could they be taking there? Before they left they shouted at me and told me I was useless as I did not have a job, they said their other Dil was so much better than me and had a career, they tried to Bait me but I did not react. My husband sat through their entire rant without standing up for me. After they left I discovered my family heirlooms were gone including my mother's jewelry, rosary, christening dress, her needlework, my stamp albums, ornaments and my great grandmother's collection of silk and lace. Mil rang and told me I must go to the op shop. I could not understand why. I found remnants at op shop, realised that is where they had donated my belongings, but could not trace them.

PTSD-647,I am a model and because of mean things my mother said to me I worry constantly about my appearance,I think I have body dysmorphia because I spend a lot of time thinking abolut the appearance of my nose. Even though I have modeled for years I still think it is not right and my mother and older sister were jealous of me when I was little and said things about my appearance because my adult sibling came to the agency (modelling) and they did not accept her. Ever since then she has criticized everything about me and i was just wondering if anyone else here has experienced constant criticism and emotional abuse. I feel it is like stalking-watchung until I make a mistake then piouncing on me. It is really hard because i still have 2 years of school to finish before I can be rid of these abusers. I love my father but he was not strong enough to get away form my mother's constant abuse. She emotionally abuses him too. She manipulates him into thinking he could not do anything without her but his success is based solely on his intelligence. He doesn;t see that but I do. There are things i don;t see like how everyone says I am pretty I am thinking about the mean things my mother and sister said. I think it is a defence mechanism so that I don;t get conceited but trust me i am far from that.

PTSD-648,PTSD caused by Narcissistic Abuse,"Hi, I am a survivor of Narcissistic Abuse in my family of origin. I have both narcissistic parents, and their golden child daughter. I am the family scapegoat and since I left home and maintain minimal contact with my narcissistic family, I believe my intellectually disabled brother might now be the scapegoat, especially by my mother, which is why I think he ends up getting violent whenever she is close by. From 2009-2010, my sister made my family's (husband, myself and 2 sons) life hell. My NM fully supported her and I was subject to a smear campaign, along with my brother-in-law whom we eventually lost to suicide a few years ago. Since moving back home from NZ, I have not kept in contact with my parents' other daughter and have maintained minimal contact with my NM. I don't call them. They call me and I answer if I feel like it. For some reason, I was under the impression that my dad was an enabler, but after the events of yesterday and paying closer attention to events as I have had to do for my trauma work with my psychologist, I'm beginning to wonder if he was a Narc after all. I would like to share a couple of messages and hope that I could get some insight. Me: Hi Dadsy! It was good to hear your voice and to know that you had to take a break. You are working far too hard as always! Anyway, I have been doing a bit of end of life planning and I had a question to ask you. I hope that you don't think that I'm being rude or nosy. I was just wondering if there was something in your documentation for protecting (brother) and I from (NM) and (Emotional Vampire Sibling)? Background - I have spelled out the abuse to my dad in heartwrenching detail some years back and it was totally dismissed and I was told to reconcile with the sibling. Dad's Reply - Dear (name). I am sad that you feel the need for protection from your mum who has given birth to u and raised u up. She is not a demon to devour you. Neither your blood sister. The reason I need to work at 72 is because the 2 able kids I have cannot take care of us in any way. Both of u shed your responsibility leaving [brother] with us at an old age. We have given you both the best compared to the rest in my family with no returns. If I don't work who is going to feed us?

PTSD-649,"Leaving place of Trauma, feeling guilt for doing so.","I am feeling so lost right now. It has been several months since my father passed away unexpectedly at home. I have continued to live here with great difficulty, unable to access room beyond the living room as the trauma, shock, and memory of finding dad in his room is too much for me. I have been living in the front room only and at certain points even had to leave to use the bathroom of nearby restaurant as the bathroom is down the hall, past my parents room. All of this has taken a massive toll on me, and finally after so much bureaucracy and hassle, I now have the opportunity to move, yet rather than finally feeling free, or even relief, I find myself feeling empty and lost. Moving is difficult at the best of times, now everything I wanted has sent me into a panic of feeling regret, remorse and guilt, guilt that I am somehow abandoning dad, thinking that since he passed in his sleep, maybe his spirit is here, and if I leave, he will be alone. I don't know, my mind is thinking so much now, rewinding back to all of the love and joy here, then to the sorrow and loss I am in, I don't know why I am feeling like this, I do know that dad was planning to move soon, he had talked about it for the past few years, readying to retire then move. And I know from speaking to his friends, he would not want me to be this way, afraid of my own home, yet afraid to move. I know he wants me to live a happy life, and be who I was before, the son he was so proud of. I guess what I am asking is, has anyone else experienced guilt and fear when deciding to move from a home that holds so many memories? Right now I feel stuck, can't stay here, afraid to move, I thought after such a long issue to solve, this would have given me some relief, yet it has only seemed to spur more sorrow, and somehow make his loss feel more real. I wrote two thing tonight, one was a for and against for moving, staying here has 8 things I could note, moving holds 12 or more positive things, yet I am contemplating rejecting the offer, even though I know I may not get another chance.

Leading up to the therapy I was functioning quite normally but I wasn’t happy. My psychologist diagnosed me with mild depression. About six weeks ago I started getting very anxious before each session. I would drink too much alcohol in the days leading up to therapy and it was occupying all my thoughts. I feel like my depression has increased and I’ve had to double the dose of my medication which has horrible side effects. I cancelled this weeks session because I was simply too worked up and distressed to go ahead with it. My psychologist wants me to continue as she thinks we are making progress but the more I think about it the more anxious and depressed I become. I’ve been thinking suicidal thoughts and I am not really sure of the difference between thinking and acting on suicide.

PTSD-657,Completely unable to talk about trauma,"Hi, first post on these forums! Basically, something happened in my family life when I was about 8. Technically it's still ongoing. I don't know if it would be considered trauma... I feel stupid calling it that as I myself was never hurt or in danger of being hurt. The thing is, I completely and utterly cannot talk about it. I never have been able to with anyone except for my family. Every time I try I completely shut down -- whenever the surrounding topic comes up I freeze. I have been going to therapy since after this event happened for general anxiety/ depression stuff but I feel like I wasted it all since this huge thing has never been hinted to. My mum sat in the room with every therapist I had until I was 15 and directly changed the narrative. I know I can only get better if I investigate this, but I don't know how. I feel like I've wasted so much money on pointless therapy sessions. I don't know what to do anymore. A while back I was supposed to have an appointment with a psychiatrist but I broke down when he asked me to recount my childhood and I just couldn't speak. I apologised for wasting his time. I've promised myself and my psychologists that one day I would open up, but I can't. I even wrote it down in a word document, but I can't bring myself to send it. I've been sitting on this secret for over a decade... I just feel so completely damaged. I wonder how much of my difficulties with my mental health have actually been caused by this. I really don't know how I can recover from this, or how my life would look if I told someone (I think I'd feel guilty), or if I'm just being dramatic... I know I'm at the point right now that all I need is the right support and help, but I'm aware that means talking about it and I'm so so scared.

And they all say the same thing, extreme / high risk of PTSD. i am wondering, please, any PTSD sufferers, can you explain what its like, and how it ""feels"" and how it impacts your daily life. i have high functioning asperger syndrome, and other diagnosis' and i have learned most recently, i cannot trust my own thoughts, i dont know how i feel on a day to day basis. only time i know what i am ""feeling"" is when i cry, because their are tears, and my heart hurts and goes cold, and when i am angry. because i get very jittery and end up having a seizure if i get to upset. i basically sit here, flat and emotionless. i am capable of laughing. it seems people dont like it though. they say i am childish, and my friend said i have the mental age of 13. which actually makes sense. as i have always gotten along better with people much younger than me, and seem to be on the same wavelength, and just ""click"". especially if they are autistic to. even girls, as young as 15 have tried to date / get with me. i know this is totally inappropriate so i turn them down respectfully. i cop an earful for it, but i know its the right thing to do. i just wish i knew why someone that young could possibly have a ""crush"" on someone like me, and my age. which i disclose well and truly early on. like when i am introduced to a girl, or if she talks to me. i tell her my name and age. its very confusing. i realised i have gone a bit off topic here. sorry. i do that. just looking for advice.",n2k12,Community Member,01-07-2021,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/wondering-i-also-have-ptsd/td-p/10587
PTSD-661,Coping with the distress from the collective of traumatic events,"I was just on Facebook and noticed someone posted a picture of some people on their way to be executed in the Holocaust. I find images like that extremely distressing. I avoid the news because it really upsets me. How are we supposed to cope when we are bombarded with distressing images and information of traumatic events that don't even directly affect us? I worry that it is intentional! I'm still so haunted by 9/11, by the planes crashing or going missing over the years, the world wars and the Holocaust, the building collapse recently.. Basically all the horrible stuff blasted at us by the media. I literally imagine how all the people must have felt, their suffering and fear and sadness, their last moments, their family's grief. How are humans supposed to cope with this much pain?

PTSD-663,I think I have PTSD,"Hi guys, Firstly, I've never spoken about this to anyone really and currently struggling with life quite badly. I haven't been diagnosed with PTSD but I do feel like that it is my underlying issue in terms of my mental health. I once smoked some pot when I was about 16 which made me trip out quite hard and left me in that state of ""tripping"" for several days/weeks. I eventually got out of it and away from it and never touched drugs again but at the time I was so beyond scared and hated every second of it. It's clear it was laced with something else but unsure what yet. I was good for a few years and didn't feel any anxiety or worries about anything really but when I did I felt like I was sort of tripping a little bit, takes me back to that night and I've always been scared about feeling that way again as it was the worst day of my life. I didn't really think about it like that before but it does definitely seem like PTSD is the thing I have and struggle with. My anxiety has been HORRIBLE as of recent and feeling like I am ""tripping"" when my anxiety is high again but not to the full extent but other symptoms I get is my memory becomes foggy, I come to an instant panic and need to leave where I am or what I'm doing and get home asap, I feel like life is pointless and seems ""fake"" sometimes. Hard to explain but just wanted to share. I hope I can get a proper diagnosis soon and get the help I finally deserve because I can NOT live like this anymore. It affects my every day life, jobs, relationships and everything in between. I am petrified I will never feel normal again.",SkiitZ,Community Member,30-06-2021,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-think-i-have-ptsd/td-p/17963
PTSD-664,"Trauma relived over and over, how long can a person go on this way?","These past several months have been a blur, I have been treading water so long, I wish I had some solid ground upon which to stand. Losing my dad, finding my brother, losing my mother, finding my uncle, losing my aunt... I cannot believe all of this has happened, yet it has. For a variety of reasons I still have to live in the family home where I found my dad, all of these months later I still exist only in the front room, the other rooms past his bedroom are merely memories to me now. Memories are what haunt me, I have packed everything in readiness to move, a move I have had to put on hold, and this terrifies me. Everywhere I look reminds me of dad, of mum, the faded marks of pictures that once hung on the wall, the faint smell of all of those wonderful meals we ate together, the echoes of laughter we all shared, now drowned out by the deafening silence of an empty place I once called home. I don't know how much longer it will take until everything is settled and I can move, I don't know how much longer I can last. How can one come to terms with a trauma, if one is constantly exposed to it each and every day? I feel myself deteriorating, having to wake up here, remembering that initial day when I woke up and called out to him all over again... I am so scared right now, I am scared that the damage has been done. I am scared that everything I have tried to achieve, with the support of my counsellors, will all fall away. I had slowly began to renter life over the past few months, reconnecting with my friends, enrolling into courses, attend further sessions, and even a grief support group, which was a daunting prospect but one I wished to push myself to do. But now with lockdown everything has halted, back to telehealth, back to here, back to nothing. These next two weeks I face inside this place scare me more than anything I have ever experienced. Just when I swam to shore, the wave takes me out again, I don't know if I have it in me to keep afloat. I have written so much, so many words, from poetry to music, I even created a book and video for dad for his f...... but words are I don't know how much damage has been caused by staying here so long...I hope everything is sorted soon, and I can move somewhere without this darkness hanging over everything, I miss dad so much, I miss mum, I miss my aunt, I wish my brother would connect with me, I wish I could go to sleep and wake up and things would be back to the way they were....",pl515p1,Community Member,28-06-2021,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trauma-relived-over-and-over-how-long-can-a-person-go-on-this/td-p/7860
PTSD-665,We were sexually abused by our grandfather,"I can't remember the exact age I was when the abuse happened, but I do remember that I was still in pull-ups, so I was so young that I was still toilet training (I'm guessing between the age of 5-6). My younger half sister is 2 years younger than me, so she would have been 3 or 4. My brother is 2 years older than me. So he would have been either 7 or 8 years old. I have extremely clear and vivid memories of all of the abuse that occurred. I still remember what each room in the house looked like, the colour of the bed frames, the carpet, I remember everything like it happened yesterday. I am currently 23 years old, so this happened around 18 years ago. Throughout my teenage/adult years of life, I have struggled with intimate relationships. I have been cheated on multiple times, physically and mentally abused by previous partners, as I am an easy target for abuse. I struggle with abandonment issues. I have never had a relationship or friendship that has lasted. My main reason for this post is to talk about my older brother. He was living at home with me, my mum and our two younger half brothers since just over 4 years ago now. One day he decided to move out of home to go and live with grandparents (on my mum's side). My brother and I were super close before he left, and we were like best friends. Anyways, he moved into my grandparents house with them, and after a few months went by, I found out my grandma confronted my brother, asking if he was taking drugs, as she had noticed he was constantly sniffing. This seemed to distress my brother, and shortly after, he ended up moving out with some of his friends. A few months went by, I had tried to contact him, but would never get a response. My brother ignored me for months, then finally responded to me asking why he was ignoring me. He sent me a long message explaining that he felt guilty about what had happened with our grandfather, and briefly came out saying he had also been sexually abused. (At this point, I was unaware that he had also been sexually abused... I knew that he had watched me be sexually abused, as he had told our mum years after the abuse happened, but he had never told anyone that he too was abused.) Reading the message he sent me was very upsetting, and I felt extremely confused as to why my brother would not want to speak to me or see me. Another 3 years have passed. I still haven't been able to speak to or see my brother, as he has cut all contact with me. I feel I am being blamed.",Bee1998,Community Member,25-06-2021,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/we-were-sexually-abused-by-our-grandfather/td-p/26836
PTSD-666,Should I share trauma with my family,"Hi all, I am a long time reader and first time poster here. I have been working through a trauma I experienced sone years ago with cognitive processing therapy and this has brought some things up for me. At the time, there was a complicated court case and a lot of media that perpetuated what happened. I have never told my family (who are generally supportive) about what happened, but have been thinking about this for some time, especially now I am actively working on processing it. I am worried they won't react in a helpful way, and once they know there are things online where they would be able to see details of what happened and once I tell them it can't be un-told if that makes sense? I was wondering what people's experiences have been around this and if anyone has any advice.

PTSD-667,I found my deceased pet and can’t stop rethinking it,"My pet cat went missing for 5 days the other day and I wasn’t sure what to think. Was he alive was he gone like I had no many thought rushing through my mind, I had a gut feeling something was terribly wrong and that he would be over my neighbours fence where nobody lives. For the past few days he was missing I’d check over the fence regularly but the grass was too tall to see anything, come Monday night I couldn’t take it anymore I jump the fence and start searching for my poor darling. After searching high and low I find him laying in the position he would lay in when we would sleep and that broke my heart, it looked like he had been attacked and he just didn’t look like him but I could tell it was him because that’s my baby. I stood there for a bit trying to breathe and stop my heart from racing because I didn’t know what I was going to do and felt like I was having a heart attack, I picked him up and took him home I couldn’t stop crying and my heart wouldn’t stop racing. For the past couple of night when I’ve tried to sleep as soon as I close my eyes it just goes straight back to the moment I found him, my heart starts beating faster and faster my eyes start watering and in that moment again I can’t breathe I have to sit up and try to breathe but it won’t help. I wake up in the middle of the night having flashbacks to when I found his lifeless body on the floor and I don’t know what to do because it hurts so much trying to breathe. I just hope the pain and hurt stops because I can’t deal with this anymore it hurts to even close my eyes, I don’t know what it is everytime I close my eyes my heart just starts racing and racing and I can’t stop it I have to sit up in my bed for me to feel semi ok again.

PTSD-668,My new Boyfriend and his old problems,"So I have started dating someone and I recognise the signs of PTSD as I too have suffered with it. I have tried to be supportive, I have remained calmed and listened to all the stories that he has never told anyone else before. Sometimes I feel like he is telling me these things and only seeing them for the first time himself because he spent so long trying to pretend they didn’t happen or push them aside to be able to keep going on. There has been times when I’ve felt hurt because he seems to still have so much emotions about the situation all which involves his ex and the trauma she inflicted on him over years. He has assured me that he no longer has any feelings for her at all. Is he just processing things? Dealing with them for the first time? There has even been intimate times that we have shared together where he ends up crying and saying that he can’t believe that he spent so many years feeling unloved and now he knows what love feels like. I want to be able to support him in the best possible way, and I think I could do that better if I understood what he is feeling. Any advice would be appreciated.",Moving forward happy,Community Member,30-05-2021,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-new-boyfriend-and-his-old-problems/td-p/22638
PTSD-669,Losing a Mother,"My story (extracts) goes back many decades ago ... I did not grow up with my mother and father. They divorced when I was almost 3 and we went to live with my father. I only saw my mother during school holidays. The two were constantly at loggerheads over us and all I wanted to do was be with my mother. Due to my father's work, my brother and I were moved from one brother/sister of my father, depending on how things developed. Growing up I had very little interaction with my mom. As a teenager I 'demanded' to go and live with my mother who, in the meantime, had remarried and had two children. I spent my last two years of senior school living with them. I got married shortly after leaving school and then had even less interaction with my mother. After my second husband commited suicide , I invited her to come and live with me and my two younger kids (she had divorced by then) so that I could help take care of her. My two eldest kids were with my first husband. My mother refused, accusing me that I just wanted her to come and live with me so that she can become my babysitter. I was extremely hurt but said nothing. She ended up becoming the baby sitter to my younger sister and her husband. Despite this, I still loved and cared deeply for her. I never held this against my sister as she was unaware of what had transpired between me and my mother. When I eventually remarried for the third time, I left South Africa with my new husband to work in the Middle-East. We eventually settled in Australia and I brough my mom out for her 80th birthday. Despite everything that had transpired in our past, I still loved and cared for her. As she got older, I arranged with my siblings to take care of her and a year ago we got a live-in carer. In the past 6-months her health really deteriorated fast. As I did not want my sister and niece to be the two to discover my mom should she pass during the night, I, again, arranged with my siblings to have her rehomed into a frail care facility. She moved in on Monday and passed on Tuesday. I am really struggling to accept this and come to terms with her passing. I cannot understand why as she wasn't ever there for me when I needed her. I, in turn, tried to be there for her. I'm also concerned for the mental wellbeing of my siser and niece - they are both bipolar. I am already on anti-depression and anxiety tablets yet have this anxious, dead, dull feeling inside me.

PTSD-670,Using Poetry as a form of communication during therapy,"I know this sounds weird but when I first started therapy with a psychologist for severe nightmares and panic attacks, his 1st question was had I ever been the victim of abuse. I immediately said no because he had a student with him. A few sessions later I admitted that I had been at school. I couldn't look my psychologist in the eyes. And I couldn't really verbalise how my life had snowballed into being the victim of abuse several times. It took me over a year to say the word r**e. So I would write what I needed to say. Eventually it became a form of writing it through poetry. This is one such poem. You left me wounded A flicker of candle flame Burnt down to the nub Wax melted White like my spirit Red as thick as blood Your devious actions Burns too long In my memory Ash as hot as hades You moved on Unconcerned Of the hurt you inflicted I stayed here Languishing In the uncomfortable Pain of it The harder I try to heal The deeper the burn Your image implanted Deep in my soul",Knuckleberry_Poe,Community Member,17-04-2021,PTSD and trauma,12,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/using-poetry-as-a-form-of-communication-during-therapy/td-p/32284
PTSD-671,Advice for moving forward -,"I guess you are the right people to ask. I separated from a 16yr relationship with my girlfriend. We have two children. We both had breakdowns. Hers was caused by a death at work. Mine was caused by my family suddenly dumping my kids when they had there own biological grandchildren. They were growing up knowing my parents as nan and pop and the rejection definitely hurt my eldest the most. My partner gave birth to our babies as I had lost my younger brother at 5 and really could not. Previous to meeting my partner I had probably dated 20 women. After the separation the war started. I started getting terrible threats on my social media channels and all of my tech was hacked - often. I asked a friend whom I had had since the age of 6 to help me out. She suggested a friend of her husbands whom worked in tech security. So I agreed to meet him at a pub from there my drink was spiked, I was hypnotised and taken advantage of. Apparently it was filmed as ""revenge porn"". I reported it as rape to the local police as my consent was taken away from me and it was laughed off, they asked ""what were you wearing?"" After I went to the local pub and my drink was spiked, there were no cameras as it had just opened back up and I passed out unconscious for 30mins. I spent the night at RPA hospital. (where my ex and her sister used to work). My brother was involved in the ""rape"". I again reported to to police as my blood alcohol reading was 15 drinks - which was not at all the case. I had 2 drinks. I sourced the info from my blood alcochol and gave it to the police - nothing was done. I moved away after the abuse for protection and it affected my kids. I moved back to Sydney to try and be there for them. They would call me crying as my ex partner is sometimes ferocious and I was their ""mum"" at home whom they relied on. I would have to tell them to hide under their beds and it tore me apart. I moved back to sydney and received an invite to a bogus lesbian night which I attended, a woman gave me her number. I called her afterwards to meet up for a drink which she did. She asked to go to my place which we did and again I was taken advantage of. I am completely traumatised, cannot love someone without anxiety attacks and each time I try to book a psych with a GP or try and get help it is diverted.

PTSD-672,Domestic violence & Male survivors,"Hi All, here's my story. Three years ago I was attacked by my wife. It wasn't the first time I was abused by her, but it was certainly the most violent. I stayed in the 9 year marriage because very early in we had a daughter and I stayed because of her. I was diagnosed with PTSD. I finished with therapy in February because we came to the decision that I have got the tools to cope and I was doing OK. Some days I am OK, but some days I'm not. I cope ugly. I just wish that when people talk about DV, even experts, they could mention Male survivors. I feel that I don't have a voice and because domestic violence comes up in the media often it cuts deep into me. No one talks about male survivors, I feel like I am treated as nothing. Over the years I never hit my wife, but she hit me. Funnily enough it was my Psychologist who told me I was a survivor of DV, I thought it was something that men did to women. I just wish that people would speak the truth about it.

PTSD-673,Miscarriage Struggle,"ok so this is harder then I thought it would be.. Hoping to get some advice. So last year in August I had a missed miscarriage. I was not in a serious relationship so no support from a partner. When I found out I was pregnant I started seeing a GP weekly as I have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember, I'm 34 yrs old. My GP specialises in mental health, so after my missed miscarriage which has destroyed me, I continued to see my GP weekly. But instead of talking about the miscarriage he wanted to do EMDR therapy, so starting from the beginning of my depression/life. Which I found very difficult to put aside what had just happened and try to focus on the past. I stuck with it until recently and we still had not reached the topic of the miscarriage. I am wondering if this was the right approach? I'm feeling let down and like I had no support with what happened. I no longer talk to any of my friends who have kids, I still haven't gone to visit my sister and meet her 2nd child who will be 1 year old next month. I just cant bring myself to do any of it. But I also feel like its been nearly a year since it happened and that I should just be over it now.

PTSD-674,Still recovering from an abusive relationship,"It's been a year and half now since I finally left, when it finally became too much. Which you might realise was about the same time the pandemic hit. The problems began well before then of course, what I didn't realise at the time was that his failure to get the medical and mental health help he needed was because he was in hiding. The guy I spent six years with, that I spent a good portion of that time trusting, loving, caring for, was actually on the run from the police and had been doing so for a good ten years. I am still in the slow process of understanding just how he slowly manipulated me and healing from that, learning from it so I know and aviod the signs if it ever happens again and also undoing the damage he has done to me on a mental and emotional level. It's hard because I had built up such a picture in my mind of how things should have gone. I feel like I am grieving and I am greiving the dream, if that makes any sense and I am dealing with the depression that is a result of the fact my life at 40 doesn't look remotely like the one I envisioned.",Mar8ie,Community Member,17-06-2021,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/still-recovering-from-an-abusive-relationship/td-p/22628
PTSD-675,Struggling to cope after multiple traumas and child loss,"I'm not even sure where to start. The I've survived so many traumas yet now.... I'm at breaking point. I survived childhood physical abuse, a 2 year relationship where I experienced emotional, mental and physical abuse as well as repeated sexual assaults which resulted in my 2 daughter's. I reached a point where I was so low I tried to kill myself, and that was how I escaped my ex. Yet I didn't really escape... I had to fight like hell to keep custody of my daughters while my ex kept dragging my name through the mud. A few years after I got out of that ""relationship"" Imet my husband. We had a son born with 1/2 a heart. I survived 6 months in hospital watching him go through multiple surgeries and procedures. Seeing him die and be brought back more times than I can count, then the terror of bringing him home where there was no nurses and doctors on hand..... Watching him get sick over and over again and rushing him to hospital fearing the worst every time.... While dealing with that our 2nd son was stillborn. My eldest daughter was diagnosed with autism and needed lots of therapy, my son needed therapy...I suffered through 5 miscarriages and when I was pregnant again our first born 3 year old ended up back in hospital and dieing in front of me. I kept going despite wanting to crawl into his casket with him. I had to think about my baby on the way. But now almost a year after my son's death.... I'm not sure how long I can keep pushing through and pretending I'm alright. I've endured so much stress and grief continuously over the last 8 years that I'm always in a heightened state of anxiety. I get panic attacks daily, I can't sleep because every time I do I relive the moment when my 2nd son was stillborn or the day my first sons life support was switched off and I felt his life leave his body. Food tastes like ash in my mouth.I jump at every noise. I can't let other people watch my kids anymore because I always freak out thinking of all the bad things that can happen to them. Every time my daughter has behaviour issues at school and I get called, I feel like I'm failing as a mum.... Because I can't seem to help her do better. And secretly I want to just crawl into bed and give up. Every single problem even the small ones seem like too much to handle. At this point I don't know how I can clime back out of the darkness. I love my kids too much to end my life I can't put them through that pain. But I don't want to keep going either.",Tearainy,Community Member,12-06-2021,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-to-cope-after-multiple-traumas-and-child-loss/td-p/6349
PTSD-676,I don't know if I actually have PTSD,"Last year I had sex with this boy I'd been talking to for months. (we were both 13) I really liked him and trusted him and he'd said he loved me and I believed him. At the time it happened, he told me he liked another girl and I thought that was ok. After it, he kept ignoring me and blocked me a couple of times, syaing I was ""too clingy"", ""attention seeking"" and ""annoying"". I completely believed it all. I then got really depressed becuase of what he said to me and considered suicide. I told the boy and he said that I should and it's a good idea. One night after he'd blocked me again I tried to end my life. But it's a year later and I'm alive. I think I forgive the boy but i'm not sure because I still can't do some things or think about certain things because of what he did to me. For example, he used to play basketball, and up until 2 weeks ago, I still couldn't sit at a basketball game without havign a panic attack. I'm not sure if this is PTSD or what but I know it was traumatic for myself. Also, I have autism so I'm already not good at relationships so I'm not great at seeing red flags and things and now i'm worried that because my first romantic/sexual relationship was literally only sex and then isolation that's what I expect from the rest of my relationships which is bad because I'm almost 15 and I still don't know how to have a healthy relationship. But idk if it really is PTSD or not.

I find that my husband appears to have become a dictator in how I live - he controls who I can see, insisting on a word by word account of every conversation I have. previous requests by me to get marriage counselling result in more arguments and him belittling me. Maybe I do have some mental health issues but I believe that many of them are caused be his behaviour. we live in a small community and every time I try to become involved in any thing he takes over or belittles me in front of the community and I walk away. I would like to sell up a go our separate ways but he refuses to acknowledge the death of our marriage and we don’t have the finances for me to establish myself somewhere separate to him. he has caused a rift between me and anybody that I tried to reach out to. I wasn’t allowed to take HRT because he believed that it was bad for his health if we had sex while I was on it.

PTSD-679,AFTER the psychologist/psychiatrist appointment,"Just curious. I always feel so drained & emotionally overwhelmed after my appointments, that all want to do is curl up in bed & cry. At the very least, I’ll nap on the lounge. I know I’m using sleep as an avoidance, but I can’t seem to break this cycle. I just had a Telehealth session with my psychologist & as soon as the video call ended I just wanted to burst into tears. And now all I want to do is sleep for hours & hopefully the emotional pain will be less when I wake up. Does anyone else experience something like this? Has anyone managed to break the cycle? I know I should get up & do something to distract me from these thoughts but I can’t quite bring myself to take the first step. As soon as this is posted I am going to roll over & go to sleep",TheBigBlue,Community Member,01-06-2021,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/after-the-psychologist-psychiatrist-appointment/td-p/19862
PTSD-680,witnessed mother in laws death. distressing content,"Distressing content I'm not even sure what I am trying to get out of this, but I've been really struggling. Back in 2016 I found out I was about 6 weeks pregnant. I was on a medication at the time, that meant, IF my child even survived he or she would most likely have severe disability and physical deformations. We were advised to terminate. The day before my appointment I miscarried in the shower, at home, completely alone. The pain was unbearable, both mental and physical. This was pretty much hidden from everyone except my partner and mother, because mum thought it would be to hard for people to know. About 1 month later my partner had to unexpectedly fly over to another state to be with his mum, who was diagnosed with lung cancer and only given weeks to live. About a week after he fly over, I got a call to say get here now. At short notice I left work and got on a plane. I spent 1 day there. The next night, while we were at hospital and I was watching my partners nephew, while they had some family conversations. His nephew had an asthma attack and had to be taken to the hospital about 10 minutes away, but my partners, sister in law. My partners childhood friends also travelled over to say there goodbyes and we were staying at his brothers house. I was asked to stay with there mum that night (As she didn't want to be alone) Most of the night she just slept, her last son left the hospital at 7pm. I sat next to her all night and about an hour later I grabbed a pack of biscuits that was out. The rustling made her wake up and she started coughing and choking. I instantly hit the big emergency button and nurses came rushing in. I stayed there the whole time with her as she passed. Afterwards the nurses told me to go and get cleaned up before her family arrived. And for some reason once they all left the room, I rang her sons to let them know. I layed there next to her for about half an hour, (family was at least an hour away) before a nurse came in to start cleaning her up before her family got there. They covered her body upto her shoulders, so her family couldnt see the mess that had happened during her death. I am still struggling to deal with what I seen and the fact that I couldnt do anything to help her. Ive tried getting family and friend support, but they dont want to hear it, and obviously I cant talk to my partner or his family about it",Starrysky1,Community Member,08-06-2021,PTSD and trauma,11,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/witnessed-mother-in-laws-death-distressing-content/td-p/2617
PTSD-681,I wish my loved ones understood that you can't just 'get over' something traumatic.,"Hi everyone I hope you are doing well today. First off, I am so thankful that this forum exists and all you wonderful people are part of it. I feel like this is a place I can always go to and I can get things off my chest. As per the title, my loved ones often tell me to 'get over it' if I am struggling about a traumatic time I had in the past. I understand why they take this stance, they are stoic and believe in just keeping on keeping on. I wish they would listen to me if I wanted to talk about it. But I have had to manage on my own with it a lot. I feel that some people may not realise that something traumatic does not just 'go away' once the event itself finishes. Sometimes something will trigger it again and the trauma resurfaces. I have got a friend I can talk to, but they have having some struggles so I might talk to them about it in a day or two. I have also been to therapy for this issue which helped a lot. My ex partner stalked me after we ended the relationship mutually. This kept going for about two years after. I had to tell the police. I saw him today. I just can't believe it. I was planning to enjoy catching up on some shopping and browsing the aisles for what I fancied. He was there. I could not escape. I was forced to be near him and interact with him as he works at that store. I still did my shopping, I do not let this beat me. There were other people around, I felt safe. He had to check my shopping bags before I left as their store policy. I hope he did not see my hands shaking. I do not want him to know how much what happened has impacted me, and still does. I did some more shopping. But I felt like I could not go home right away. I wanted to just drive, get away. I almost decided to drive to another town but stopped myself. I just felt this need to be distanced. I was still shaking. I hate I was so close to him, it was less than a metre. When I got home I showered. I scrubbed my arms because they were close to him. I threw away the bag he touched. I have felt very numb and odd for the rest of today. I am upset. I told my family it was 'a lot' seeing him again. I tried to see if I could have a hug from one of my loved ones and they said no. We do not hug much generally and joke a lot. But that hurt a lot. They make me feel as if I am weak for what I am feeling. So, I stopped talking and went to bed to lay down. I am trying to manage it. I am still feeling upset. I know I will be okay.

PTSD-682,Family Sexual Abuse,As an 8 yr old I was sexually abused by my Dad once. This was the one & only time this happened. I told my sister once when we were in our teens & she didn’t believe me & I have never spoken of it since. The impact has not been a problem for me or so I thought til recently. My Dad is a good Dad & everyone loves him & if I spoke of this it would devastate so many who I love so much. I can’t do that to them. This is my choice as he is actually a very good person & I feel like I’m the only person he’s ever tried this shit on. It changed me from that moment on. It’s so unfair as the implications for me from that moment have been life changing. I am a very highly functional person with a successful business & I’m talking decades later. It’s my choice to protect al those I love so much & he only did it once. It still actually happened & I can’t talk to anyone about it.

PTSD-685,Diary: Venting,"A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with ocd and ptsd then at the start of last year with complex trauma, bpd and depression, recently I have had next to no outside support. I had so much happen to me growing up and had some bad cards dealt. I've recently lost someone unexpectedly close to me. I feel stuck, I don't know who to talk to and just need to vent and let some stuff off my chest. My partner knows I'm not well, but I feel like if I talk to him (he has bipolar) and that's just makes things harder not better. He says I can but I feel like it does more bad than good. I'm the one who helps everyone else and I know I always put myself last Sometimes I look at the people around me and wonder what it feels like to shut off and just let go, even just for a little while The bright star in my life is my son, he is the best thing to happen to me. I want to get better for him, I have my good and bad days, but the last couple of months I've felt so numb. I tried to reach out to a counsellor in regards to a close family member I lost 2 months ago but so far I've heard nothing back. With everything going on with the pandemic and constant in and out of lockdown the mental health system is so backed up I don't know where to turn. Last year I was was sent on my way very quickly, it was the most raw experience, the nurse was crying to what I had to say, at the time I was paying for outside therapy so they advised to continue that but it didn't work out, I lost my job due to having a mental breakdown last year and struggled to afford it and had to stop going.",ImTired,Community Member,08-06-2021,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/diary-venting/td-p/23715
PTSD-686,Nudity - Seriously concerned and seeking advice - Is this ok?,"Hi, I have PTSD. I have had several traumatic events happen in my life, both sexual and physical. I have a loving husband who has walked this with me and helped me each step of the way. However, last night he dropped, what felt like a bomb shell on me. Some background. Last year I had suicidal thoughts and was in hospital for two weeks - my mental health got very bad at the time and I reached out via Beyond Blue who helped me at the time. In recent months my mental health has been a lot better - better than it has in a long time - or so I thought. Last night my husband tells me, tells me not asks me, he is going to a nudist board game night where nudists get together and play board games, quite casually. We are monogamous but neither of us have ever had any issue with the other socialising with friends outside the marriage - as friends. Like social events with other people that the other partner may not know - we have always trusted each other in this and I have never felt distrust or discomfort of my husband going to other things - Like a book club he was a member of. I do not consider myself a possessive person in any way. But when he landed this on me all my mental health issues came flooding back, everything, the visions, the intense anger.. I felt betrayed. He didn’t understand what my issue with nudity is. He has always liked to be nude around the house - generally, as long as it isn’t in front of the kids, I don’t have an issue with this.. But something just feels so off with him being nude in front of strangers who I guess will become friends over time, as this is a regular meet up group. I feel wrong that he is going without me as his partner, but with my past trauma there is no way I could get nude in front of people I don’t know. He respects that but wants to go alone. So what do I do? I have tried twice now talking to him about my discomfort and how serious it is making my mental health - he doesn’t seem to care. He has this innate need to go to something like this. To be fair he is being respectful and not going to the one he said he would this weekend - but intends to in future and is trying to turn me. He doesn’t understand why I see nudity as sexual - but to me it feels that way, like nudity should be between us. It doesn’t feel right to me that he walks nude in front of others regularly - I don’t know why, but it is tripping my mental health big time. How can I help him see my view? And am I wrong in having these thoughts?",Ammee,Community Member,04-06-2021,PTSD and trauma,9,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/nudity-seriously-concerned-and-seeking-advice-is-this-ok/td-p/26866
PTSD-687,Gender Identity/Expression and Sexuality After Trauma - Feeling revictimised by people invalidating mine,"Hey all, I'm a straight woman but I've regularly had people make comments or question my orientation, even from childhood. It never really bothered me that people often assume I'm gay, it's not a big deal to me. However, I've had people make some really horrible comments. My sisters exhusband called me a ""man hating dyke"" and said I was probably raped by our dad. This was because I didn't accept a lift home from him when he was first dating my sister. I wasn't abused by my dad, he left when I was a very young child and I have no memories of him. I had a counsellor in highschool who would make comments implying I was closeted and that's what my problems stemmed from, I've had conversations with friends where sexuality has come up and had people tell me I'm asexual, demisexual, ace, all kinds of things and it's starting to upset me. I assume they're well meaning but it feels like sexual orientation should be about how you identify yourself and not something other people prescribe you. I recently had two male friends describe themselves as asexual and say they think it's related to bullying and trauma they experienced during school. I think it's entirely reasonable that someone could have their sexuality impacted by these things, just that mine hasn't been. It's getting to the point where I almost feel revictimised, having people treat me like I'm broken by things people have done to me. It feels like my agency is being taken away. My old manager where I worked in my late teens, a woman who was a friend of my mothers and was a solid 30 years older than me, got on top of me while I was blackout drunk at a party and kissed me. She also made a comment about how she was bisexual and knew I was too. One weird or maybe ironic thing is no one would think that made me straight. On the other hand, I know my gender expression changed because of being raped. I started wearing very oversized clothing, gained a lot of weight, stopped dressing as femininely as I used to. To some extent I (sadly) equate femininity with victimhood. I'm trying to move past this because, (and I think this is what all of this is about for me), I hate feeling like what happened has to change me in such a large way. I also really don't like the idea that people who are gay and have been abused are assumed to be gay *because* of the abuse.

But he had a problem, which I eventually found out about and yes it scared the hell out of me but I wanted to help him, I loved him. His problem destroyed lots of lives and caused a death. I couldn't sleep I couldn't eat I have the worse nightmares and no I couldn't support him anymore, we argued so much before the accident, I repeatedly told him he would hurt someone. Eventually I told the truth, which meant I would destroy his life, how do you know what's the right thing and what's the wrong thing.

PTSD-689,How to support male partner CSA victim/PTSD,"My partner and I have been together for 10 months. Early in our relationship he confided in me childhood sexual abuse perpetrated by two separate adult female caregivers (not related to him) when he was a young and mid teen. I believed him and want to support him as best I can. He believes he has put this in the past, but I beg to differ. Although he doesn’t have a diagnosis, he fits all the symptoms of cPTSD. Intimacy has been very difficult for us, his moods can change very quickly, and with them his reaction to me. He is prone to avoidant and withdrawal behaviour. He can be erratic, struggle to go to sleep and has impulse control issues around weed, binge eating, alcohol and porn, none of which really cause a major impact on his life but it’s enough for me to notice. Talking about any of this only seems to make it worse. The only thing he’s been diagnosed with is anxiety and he feels he manages well with meditation, yoga and exercise (which he does to some degree). He says that any issues are me projecting my anxiety onto him. I do have generalised anxiety but it’s really well managed - my psychologist is very pleased with how far I’ve come and I no longer need meds. It’s just hard not to be triggered when his attitude towards me changes so abruptly, from loving and sweet to distant and cold. I really want to help him too - I can see that he is hurting when these things happen, but I just can’t seem to reach him and he doesn’t want to acknowledge that anything is off. Does anyone have any tips (either as partner/carer) of the person with PTSD?I’d be really grateful.",Reen2050,Community Member,20-05-2021,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-to-support-male-partner-csa-victim-ptsd/td-p/265
PTSD-690,Living with emotional abuse - What to do??,"Hello my name is V, I’m divorce with 2 kids who I care for full time. I left my ex 8 years due to domestic violence. I left with my boys and changed my life and together with my kids we live a very happy and peaceful life. I never had much money but we were happy. 5 years later I met someone and fell in love. We move in a year into the relationship. Soon I started to notice some concerning behaviours only to realise my new partner was abusive emotionally. He would shout at me, call me name, belittle me, bully me and mock me. Sometimes he would drink and become abusive in front of my kids. we were scared, but eventually he would apologise and say he was going to change. things would good for a while until the next time, even the slightest comments would make him angry. now almost 4 years on I’m struggle to continue on in the relationship. he has 2 young kids who come one night a week and his 6 year old son demonstrates similar behaviours, he rude and very angry if disciplined. overall I feel my mental health diminishing. I feel stressed, anxious and nervous all the time. I don’t eat and I feel sick in the stomach and have so much tension in my body. I feel as though I’m going to have a breakdown. a week ago I made a comment about his sons eating habits and he responded rudely to me. I asked he not to talk to that way and he became very aggressive and hurtful. We haven’t spoken since last night when he suggested we should talk buy that turned into him attacking me, telling me it’s all my fault, yelling and raising his voice and being very over powering. Not allowing to speak or finish a sentence and shutting me down the moment I tried to say how I felt. after that conversation I told him I wanted to break up. I felt the relationship just isn’t working and causing me so much stress. He didn’t respond. I slept in my sons room and that where I’ll stay from now in. I want out of the relationship but because we own the house together and I can’t afford to just leave I will need to stay until the house is sold and I have some money to find my own place. I don’t know how to deal with the tension in the house and share a roof with someone once you’ve ended the relationship. It’s affects my children too as he and I aren’t talking and avoiding each other. He’s very angry and it’s feel so uncomfortable.

PTSD-691,My father died and I am not sure how to feel about it,"My father was an abusive drunk. My mother divorced him in 1983 when I was 18.

The gold digger and her children moved in and she married my father. He died recently and the gold digger did not tell us. I found out from a local hairdresser. I requested a copy of his will. It was dated 1991 and he left my brother and I $5 each because we never went to see him even though he violently drove us out of our home. my brother did visit him 3 years ago to make contact again. What bothers me the most is the lawyers who wrote his will think that we are arseholes for not seeing our father but he drove us away. I can't sleep, I am drinking way too much and I am swinging from deep rage to absolute depression over this and I deal with it. My father was sacked from his job for drinking when mum divorced him and he and the gold digger have never worked a day in their lives since. My mother worked her arse off in that house, even keeping debt collectors at bay. She did all the maintenance and ended up with nothing. She passed away from pancreatic cancer 9 years ago.

PTSD-692,"School yard sexual assaults, Almost blind, High Functioning Autusm and PTSD","Single mail in early 50s, was born almost blind and diagnosed with Autism during pre-school years, though this improved over my life, after 38 years have come out about my sexual assaults at high school. While in year 7 during 1983, pack of a few dozen kids sexually assaulted me. From this point, I started showering immediately after school, and though I felt physically clean, I washed, and washed, and washed, as I felt mentally dirty. This overtime grew into a OCD of cleaning which I'm still dealing with today. There was a brief period in the twenty naughties when it went way down, and I had a relatively normal lower stress life. With my autism and visual impairment, I'm trying to get the things that heavily suppressed the OCD in the 00s, but though family was initially sympathetic about me coming out about the high school sexual assaults, I'm detecting a phase change. Wile staying with mother during last few days, I'm detecting a sense of psychological pushback from both family (well, they have to help many, and they don't have the funds). Uncle makes callous comment about me working in coal mine when washing hands. And as far as NDIS, Officers hanging up mid call when making enquiries regarding my application. After about a year of mucking around, I'd finally been granted access to the scheme in late March. Planning meeting with LAC, was helpful and friendly, but staff at 1800 number were obnoxious. I didn't notice at first, but my mother overheard the conversation, and noticed before she hung up that she was playing the ""go slow"" attitude, as the deadlines for approval became longer and longer during the call (this was personal). Toward the end, I may have said something like, ""I'm not sure how those who make the decisions, having no idea what it's like to be sexually assaulted are responsible) I didn't explicitly say it, but I was getting frustrated with the ""we're playing god"" with you life attitude. I'm needing someone to advocate for me to the NDIS about my PTSD and Autism. PWD's got a lady in the local area, but (respectfully) she's not familiar with my issues and can't assist me much.

PTSD-693,*Trigger warning - Domestic violence* Lost,"I was married to my wife for 15 years. She has always been hot tempered, I accepted it. She always had a bad temper e.g. she would shout and scream at shop assistants, or her parents and occasionally this would be directed at me. I feel a coward for not standing up to her. About 2 years ago, we purchased a house and renovated it extensively - it went badly. Her aggression got progressively worse, calling me a variety of abusive names every day for small things going wrong. I was walking on egg shells and scared of her reactions, thinking I was the cause of all her pain. We eventually completed the renovation and moved in and the bad behavior continued. I meekly told her to stop and find each other again, but everything continued and got worse. The verbal abuse turned into physical at some points. I had very dark thoughts at the time, and contemplated ending it. I believe these feelings came from her upbringing where her dad gambled away all their money and created huge trauma. I talked to a female friend who helped me recognise this wasn't normal. I told the friend I would leave my wife, but my wife went through my phone and found out before I told her and attempted to commit suicide 2x. I was mentally broken, and my parents packed a bag for me and I left that evening, requesting peace. She called me over 1,000 times and texted double that in panic. Next day she came to work and assaulted a friend. I went to the police to try and get her help, but backed out. I had to move back into the house because of financial reasons. My anger grew towards her. She cried every night, blaming me wailing why did he cheat on me - I didn't. After at least 8 weeks of accusations, wailing, sleep deprivation (e.g. I'd move to a different rooms and she would barge in). I moved out of the house shortly after for my own safety and hers and tried to live by myself. I started dating as I saw no future with her. I dated others, but I miss my wife's company, but don't think its healthy. I submitted divorce papers. I feel guilty, ashamed things failed. I feel responsible for everything and I couldn't hold it together. I sleep 3-4 hours a night, self medicate with alcohol to sleep. I'm no longer interested in life.

PTSD-694,Leaving after domestic and family violence,"Hi all, 3.5 weeks ago a domestic violence service convinced me to go into emergency accommodation for a couple of weeks to have a break from my abusive partner (also the father to our two daughters, 8 and 4) they said even if it’s just the wake up call he needed to engage in the help and support he needed to start making some changes. He started talking to a psychologist via Telehealth, and told me he is just waiting for confirmation for him to start a men’s behaviour change program. I did a risk assessment and from that protective services got involved and put restrictions in place about only having supervised visits with us. They also told me if I didn’t take an IVO out against him they would because he was calling, texting and trying to visit me constantly and leaning on me for support and I was feeling so guilty and falling for the responsibility of his emotional needs because I’ve always carried that responsibility and it’s really hard to let that go. The IVO isn’t due to go to court until Friday so he is still contacting me a lot for support and I just feel to guilty and responsible to cut him off so I try to be brief and blunt but will usually give him an answer but he is really trying to get me back and I am struggling not to give in (obviously that is not possible until the protective services have taken away restrictions). How do you stop going back into that trap of the familiar cycle of abuse? It just feels so much easier than doing it in my own. My family have been quite unsupportive and have taken his side for a lot of it because I haven’t given them details and insight to the abuse we have suffered from him. I have told two of my sisters some details but they just think it’s fine and normal behaviour in a relationship. My mum was the first female for generations in her family to not be an extremely, life threatening physically violent relationship and has told us stories of rescuing family members from guns been held to them etc so I think to them unless it’s extreme physical violence it’s not family violence. I thought I could do it on my own without their support but I’m really struggling now and don’t think I can and when he sends me these messages begging for me back I just want to reassure him once restrictions are lifted I’ll take him back but I really want to show my daughters what’s right too but I really don’t know how long I can keep doing it alone.

PTSD-696,Freaked out about anything that can cause me harm,"Hi, I'm 41. I have PTSD from witnessing a suicide at work 18 months ago and generalised anxiety disorder, currently exacerbated by the PTSD. I am scared of anything and everything that cause myself or loved ones harm. EG my brothers puppy scratched me on my lip, now I'm convinced I have tetanus, to the point my jaw is sore and I have headaches. If I smell something 'unusal'i believe there's a gas leak or carbon monoxide in my house/car. If I hit my head I worry I could have a brain injury and so on. This thinking and worrying also applys to my children, my dog and my partner. I am in therapy fortnightly, I have recently settled my workers compensation claim and will be referred to a new psychiatrist and hopefully start schema therapy. Im stuck, I am sick of feeling and worrying like this all the time, but feel if I dont, something bad will happen. I dont know what else to do or how I would like people to help me. So I guess ill take what comes. My background is working in a psychiatric ward at a local hospital, up until the suicide I witnessed. I have had anxiety and depressive symptoms since I was 15, probably much younger, but we will go with 15 for arguments sake. Not currently working have 2 children, 3 cats, a dog and a puppy I am looking after almost full time for a few weeks. anyway, that's me in a nutshell. cheers for taking the time Xx",Middle_aged_and_anxious,Community Member,19-05-2021,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/freaked-out-about-anything-that-can-cause-me-harm/td-p/19870
PTSD-697,Manipulation,"I am completely lost. It is dawning on me that my husband has used manipulation to control me. We have been married for 21 years and this started before we were married. Over time he has isolated me from family and friends so I no longer have any friends. We have two children 19 and16. My daughter 16 has had ongoing issues that have involved her having a ‘secret life’, lying very convincingly, making up stories, attention seeking and manipulating me and segregating me from my husband and son. She can be extremely vile towards me too. It has been a rollercoaster and she has also struggled with suicide tendencies, self harm anxiety low self esteem depression and an eating disorder. In my plight to get her help, I ‘offloaded’ to her psychologist and mentioned how I had noticed the manipulating, secret life and lying traits in my husband. It was like opening a can of worms that I have kept the lid firmly shut on for 21 years+ The more I spoke about it the more I realised that I have been controlled and manipulated big style! My husband lies to me and I have strong suspicions that he may be involved in porn and maybe gets his sexual pleasures from other sources too. I think he has coerced me into sexual activities that I have not wanted to do including naked photo shoots. If i try to say no he still continues so I just go along. He wears me down and makes me feel guilty if I dont. I think he has filled my head with lies and rubbish that have confused my perceptions. He has a temper and makes me and the kids feel scared. He tried to hit me a long time ago but didnt and he has rough handled my daughter to the extent i had to intervene. I am so confused and messed up. dont know whats real and what isnt in our relationship. I love him and have given myself completely to him but he has held back. My kids see the same behaviours I see. My daughter has no clue that she has the same traits and my husband seems to have no clue that he has them. I am lost, broken, gutted, betrayed but feel incredibly guilty and like I am betraying him by talking about this. He has no idea I have figured this out and I am too scared to broach any of it with him as he will get angry and tell me Im imagining it. I have no idea what to do next. I have no friends here but I have talked to my sister in the uk who is not surprised as they have seen his behaviour. My kids are now fully aware of the situation. I have no idea what to do next because I dont want to leave him either!",Jen-Jo,Community Member,04-05-2021,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/manipulation/td-p/33423

PTSD-699,New C-PTSD Diagnosis,"My boyfriend broke up with me messily and over the course of two weeks. Because of that break up I have discovered and started exploring the fact that I have complex PTSD (has been diagnosed). As I am researching trauma to understand my brain and my coping behaviours, I am often reminded of my ex and the reasons for our breakup (because of those trauma coping mechanisms). Should I be refraining from starting my recovery (e.g. researching) until I see my psychologist in a fortnight, or should I continue but monitor how my mind and body feels? I’m also struggling with so much sadness at this loss because it was such a beautiful connection. I am accepting of the situation and at peace with it yet still get waves of grief.

PTSD-701,*Trigger warning - Domestic Violence* Separating from husband but scared,"I don’t know where to start my life with. I am married to this man for 6 years and we have a healthy and wonderful 3 year old son. But my husband had always been very controlling he only wants things to happen in his way and he says he loves his family but when there is an argument he says very bad things that a women can’t take. But Later when I ask he says that just to make me feel bad and make my mouth shut he spoke those words but do not mean it. How am I supposed to take those? he do not respect elders he doesn’t have much friends either. If he have any issues with any fiends he will not allow me to talk to them. He controls me of my clothing. He did not treat my family well. Still I loved him thinking that he will change. Still I think that he needs help. I myself know how much I cried for his behaviour. He got anger issues and he can’t control his mouth during anger. He says anything which comes out of his mouth during that time. He sees everything in a negative way sometimes I feel there is no positive ambience around him. He tries to control me by raising his voice or punching the door. All he did these in front of my son. But my son loves him so much and he loves our son too. That is the only thing which is making me think that I need to stay. Last year when we were arguing he hit the plate I am eating and it actually cut my chin. I still forgave him. I took intervention order but when he apologised that he didn’t treat me well and that he would take counseling sessions and he cried so much. I believed him and came back to him. He only took couple of sessions and he stopped. He behaved well for 2 months and later I can see that he has not changed much but thinks that I put him in that position. How am I supposed to tell this person that it is not working. I am broken, but I still tried for my son. I told him few times that we will separate but he wouldn’t listen and say things like I am only trying to separate from him. now I took a decision to not tell him instead go out renting a place with my son. I got a house approved and paid bond. But the feeling of pitiness on him and thinking how much my son loved him making me sick. I am mentally stressed at the moment. I have a full time job but still something in my heart is troubling me if I am doing the right thing. The feeling of separating a son and a father is killing me inside. I hope some thoughts would help me understand if I am taking a right path.",Shil,Community Member,13-05-2021,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trigger-warning-domestic-violence-separating-from-husband-but/td-p/2824

PTSD-703,PTSD and trauma,"So in September 2020, I normally get up and go to the bathroom then the kitchen but i also say hello to my dog willow. But as i walked into the kitchen, i saw blood everywhere and it was just me and my dad because the rest of my family was in the mountains and so i walked in my dads bedroom and said to him “whatgoing on in the kitchen” he didn't respond so i said it again and he finally responded saying “don’t worry about it”. I was terrified but confused at the same time. So i grabbed my phone and called triple zero for an ambulance. The thing is that, my dad drinks a lot but he has a mood that somehow only i can see. As in when he is in his ‘mood’, everybody else thinks that he is normal and that explains what i mean by i can only see it and he also tends to fall over a lot when he is in his mood. Dad and i was going to have a fun night together but it turned out to be the worst. As i talked to the dispatcher, my dad got up and asked me who I’m talking to but i ignored him and talked to the person instead. When the paramedics arrived, I still didn’t know where all the blood came from assuming from when i said that he falls over a lot. But then the paramedics said “ do you want me to clean that up for you?"" because there was a cut, and at that moment i realised that he tried to commit suicide. They took him away is the ambulance and i was to not see him for long period of time. I was sent to live with my mum and i got diagnosed with depression anxiety and stress and for ptsd too.

PTSD-705,PTSD and Sexual Assult- I need advice,"Hello peoples! I'm 13 and lived quite a normal teenage life. But in January 2021, I got sexually assaulted.

I constantly have flashbacks during the day of the event (at very random moments) and also get triggered/have bad thoughts when kids at school talk about rape and sexual assault. I also feel a lot more stressed and am worried/afraid to walk/go anywhere by myself and am generally afraid of men. Whenever i walk to school alone and pass a man, I get anxiety and freak out. My heart starts beating and i breathe faster. Even thought they aren't doing anything. Just walking past. It happens every day, and my parents are starting to become worried. I also am a little bit stressed/guilty since because of the event, my family is split up and i can't see my cousins/aunt/uncles again since its traumatic to see my cousin who caused everything. My parents know what happened and want to help but i need advice on what to do. Where do i go from here? How do i get help? Do i go see someone like a therapist or doctor or psychologist?

PTSD-706,How do we forgive ourselves?,"Married far too young, felt isolated by his family, he was their “baby”. My family had split so no support from them either, He drank far too much, I thought I could change him,, went from bad to worse, had a child trying to gain acceptance from him, his family, anyone, emotionally abused by him when drunk,(every night), no way out, no idea how to escape, nowhere to get help. Had a horrific birth experience and nearly bled to death, needed a transfusion but it was at the start of HIV, so hospital wouldn’t give transfusions because of the risks. I was existing on practically no sleep, no strength due to such low blood counts, no help at home with new baby, he was as demanding as ever. When bub was 3 months old had to start back at work, night shift because he worked days, so was surviving on maybe an hour of sleep between working night shift, looking after bub and him, I found myself in a horrific situation with absolutely no idea of a future, I just knew this was impossible. A workmate made me laugh while at work, made me feel like a human, and for reasons I have decided were probably a sub conscious attempt to end my situation, I slept with him one day while my hubby was at work. I went out to the workmate’s home and destroyed my life. My sister in law who I was close with, knew and she told my hubby, so one night while i was at work, hubby rang my work, told me he was taking our child away and they’d be gone before I could get home. Sure enough by the time I got home from my shift, he had gone and taken our child with him, she was 5 months old, and he had (while drunk) taken her and drove interstate to his family. Since then my life spiralled from one problem to another, bad relationships, drug dependence,(which I have since beaten completely) until I finally found a partner who I married and only lost when he died from cancer, 12 years ago now. Sorry for the long back story, there is so much more there, but my initial question stands...I have never forgiven myself for cheating on my hubby, he never remarried, although he still has his alcohol problem. After all my soul searching and some therapy, I still consider my self a bad person for what I did, and dont know if I can ever “let myself off”. It has coloured my entire life, I am sooo very hard on myself in every way, what do others think....I dont feel like a bad person.......Ive spent the rest of my life volunteering and and trying to make up for my youth....",Sadsec,Community Member,29-04-2021,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-do-we-forgive-ourselves/td-p/20017
PTSD-707,Changes in life and living with PTSD,"Hi all, I'm new to the forums, I joined for lots of reasons but one is because I hope discussing my PTSD and sharing my experience might be helpful for myself and others. I've lived with PTSD for a decade or so now, as a result of an abusive relationship in my 20's. It took me years to seek help for the way I felt and only learned how connected my anxiety, panic attacks and other symptoms were to surviving that relationship after spending a lot of time working with a psychologist - something which changed my life for the better. In the past 4 or 5 months, I have quit my job working in quite a senior role in a corporate environment (something I worked pretty hard to get to) and have started studying with the aim of working in counselling and social work. Obviously this is a pretty big gear change and it's triggered some old feelings of questioning my self-worth and abilities. I guess I knew this was a possibility because I now know how my PTSD works, but I really wasn't expecting how much I've struggled to control my reactions to my known triggers lately. I'm doing all the things I've learned to do and I've been as open as possible with my partner on what's going on. She has been incredibly supportive and I feel safe and loved. But no matter what I do or what tools I pull out of the tool kit I've built up over the years, I am fairly consumed with these negative thoughts and the anxiety that comes along with being affected by my triggers. I'm not sure if I'm asking for help or seeking some empathy or both, but I do hope sharing my experience might start some conversations where I can be supported and supportive. I'd love to discuss how others experience their PTSD through life changes.

PTSD-708,What I wouldn’t give..,"Hi everybody, I’m in the calm before the storm. That moment where you can feel the tide pull away before the wave crashes forward. Things were going reasonably well. I’ve been free for nearly 18 months. I finally started sleeping in my bed instead of in the lounge. My tablets seemed to be doing something. I’d stopped dissociating throughout the day and my flash backs were minimal-ish. I’m working, studying and raising a superstar daughter. I thought I’d crested that hill. Success of a sort. I went out to see a band for the first time in I don’t know how long and survived the crowds. I drank a bit to do it but I made it. Then I slept with a friend. I had three seperate panic attacks. I seemed to be ok after. Went on with life. But Its been 4 days and I can feel it. That swell before the crash. I’m not sleeping great but I’m diagnosed PTSD, insomnia, depression, anxiety so what’s new? But I can feel it. My mind slipping at the edges. Where I just want to disappear inside my self. What I wouldn’t give for the world to stop. Just pause for a day or two. So I can catch my breath. Readjust my armour. I’m aware of everything and nothing and I’m exhausted. I try running but I can never seem to run far enough lol So here I am writing to the internet. How is it I can survive 13 years of hell but some days it feels like I can’t survive the freedom without struggling for breath? I knew I was slamming down hard on some pretty big triggers, but I thought I needed to face life.. some sort of home made exposure therapy lol I thought it was progress but maybe it was just maladaptive behaviours sneaking through in disguise.. Ive got tools in my kit for when I’m experiencing my flash backs and panic attacks but I’ve not felt this build up so intensely before. I think the anticipation is worse. Maybe I finally cracked? The annoying thing is there’s no stopping. Life goes on. The world keeps spinning and all I can do is keep moving with it.

PTSD-709,Broken - My father abused my daughter,"2 years ago my adult daughter revealed she had been sexually abused by my father from 8 to 15. Our world fell apart. My poor daughter! My immediate and ongoing attention has been to ensure that she is ok. I am pleased to say she is doing well with the love & support of family + trauma counselling. I feel broken - not just heartbroken, but completely broken. I was so angry, sad, guilty & grieving my daughter's trauma & the loss of a close relationship with my dad. One of the hardest conversations I ever had was to tell my Mum what had happened. I love my children dearly. They + my wife are my life. I have always tried to be the best Dad I could. But I had failed my daughter 7 had allowed the abuse to go on. It was my job to protect her - that I did not know is not the point. I failed her when she needed me & she was not able to let me know. On 4 Jan I contemplated ending my life. I will always remember that day with a sense of shame & despair. I was alone. I sat for more than an hour going through the way out. What stopped me was realising that it would have been the ultimate selfish act. I would have added that burden to the rest of the family & I could not do that. Checking in regularly with my daughter has helped as I see she is going well. But I feel like a coward as I struggle to discuss this properly with my wife and family. We get on with the day to day but we know there are other triggers coming that we are not prepared for. Now my daughter will soon have a baby of her own. Whilst this is a joyous milestone, I am again wracked with guilt & sadness. This baby will be welcomed into a loving family & will be our first Grandchild. But I can't help feeling sad that my Mum & Dad won't be able to see their first Great Grandchild. I wonder what emotions this will bring for my daughter and for my wife. I know this is always looming like a shadow cast over everything. We have a great relationship and I always check in to ensure that my daughter is doing well - which she is. I am so fortunate to have them and my other now adult children all close with my wife 7myself. We have a lot to be thankful for. I am so very lucky in many ways. But I remain broken. I remain sad - every day. I grieve what we thought we had. I am guilty for failing my family. I get through each day, week, month. But I constantly look to these milestones with dread & deep regret that the most wonderful moments are forever tainted by my failure to protect my daughter.",Mike47,Community Member,14-04-2021,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/broken-my-father-abused-my-daughter/td-p/15287

PTSD-711,I need advice,"Hello to whoever is reading this, I have been diagnosed with PTSD for a few months now. I was severely physically and verbally (usually telling me to end myself) bullied at age 13. I am 15 now, but I just can't get away from the flashbacks no matter how hard I try. The girl who gave me so much pain is coincidentally everywhere I go, and I tend to have panic attacks of fear that she would hurt me again. I have briefly explained the surface of my trauma regarding this girl to my friends, but they still seem to talk to her, even though they know how much she hurt me. I feel so alone as I find it difficult to talk to anyone. Posting anonymously seems to be the only form of communication I feel comfortable with. Everyday is so stressful that I really don't see the point of continuing. Why should I wake up everyday just to feel the same pain I felt the day before? The thought of this girl makes me so sick and sad. The harsh things she said to me really stung, especially when she would tell me I was worthless and not good enough. Everything is just... so hard. Nobody is open to listen. I am also suffering with social anxiety, depression and anorexia. They aren't giving me any help about my trauma at all. I have really considered suicide, and even thinking of so now. But, I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this. Whenever I try and talk to my mother, her response is ""just think happy thoughts"", which obviously isn't very possible at the moment. And goodness, my father doesn't even realise what's going on. I have talked to my councillors, but I find it so difficult to talk about the bullying without feeling like I am about to throw up. My friends don't understand either, but I can't blame them for that. Please, I am in desperate need of advice. I want to stop feeling so hopeless. I wish I was happy again. I want to be away from this girl but life is so cruel and putting me and her together in every possible situation. I want to escape, but I feel so stuck. Thank you to whoever is reading this.

PTSD-713,Newbie. Survivor of childhood sexual abuse,"Hello people this is my 1st time doing this-online posts. I'm in my early 50s trying to survive trauma from child sexual abuse (CSA) by the father, which started pre-verbal years & continued till I left home abruptly at 16. There were also ocassions where I was prostituted to other men (in the family home). The mother new about a few incidences, but did nothing. All my life she has been antagonistic & belittling toward me, has never been interested in wanting to understand me or how I'm coping. My early 30s was when the first wave of memories started surfacing. What an horrendous period. I won't go into it, needless to say ive been in & out of the Psych ward a few times. I thought I had recovered, then memories flared again in my 40s & again during the RC Inst.ChildAbuse & again when Grace Tame won Austr.of the year. A few days ago it all got overwhelming I didn't sleep, broke out in clammy sweat, stomach churning body constantly shaking all through the night. I called Lifeline (1st time ever) for advice/tips to cope & the lady said ""you are the expert in your life"" ""I don't have the answers for you"") and there were long uncomfortable pauses. I was shocked. I hung up. Now I'm too scared to call back in case I get her again. I decided to call Beyond Blue. The lady was kind & took the lead in the conversation which I needed. She gave me tips on how to distract whirling thoughts. On Friday I saw my GP & we started on a journey: get a Mental Health Plan; I've contacted the Sexual Assault Support Service (I'm on an 8 week waiting list for counsellor ). I've been there before in early 30s. But what I have decided people, is that this time I want to go all the way to where I can confront the perpetrator/s (& the mother but I doubt she'll be open to communication) & report to the police. CSA has really ruined my life, I've never been able to develop normal friendships or relationships with people, particularly men. I fear intimacy & as a result have been on my own. So I'm a loner. I'm over it, I'm sick & tired of being the one who has to pick up the broken pieces of my life & make something out of it, which is always deformed;sick that the perpetrators have normal healthy financially stable lives with their wives & families. I want to seek justice as far as I can (although I know the chances & the stats around that). It's going to be a long painful journey;no doubt costly in more ways than 1 but if I don't try then I haven't given myself the best chance!",Chartres,Community Member,10-04-2021,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/newbie-survivor-of-childhood-sexual-abuse/td-p/530404

PTSD-715,Advice on leaving emotionally/verbally abusive partner,"Hi all I have been with my partner for nearly 10 years and we have a 7 year old daughter. I realised some time ago that he is verbally abusive. He does not respect me. We broke up a few years ago and then i stupidly took him back. He changed for a while then things went downhill again. He lost work a year ago due to covid and I am now the only one working. I come home from work, cook dinner, clean and look after our daughter while he sits on his computer game. He will also often whinge about what i make for dinner. He gives me money for half the rent but i have to pay for everything else. He always puts me down and to him i can't do anything right. He is also teaching our daughter to disrespect me. He will call me a name and she will also say it to me. He told her to ""give me hell."" He has never hit me but has otherwise gotten physical with me. I feel like i cannot have my own opinions or stand up for myself. So I mostly stay silent and I feel like I am walking on eggshells. I tense up really bad when he comes near me or when I hear his car pull in. I do not love him anymore and I feel increasingly depressed in this relationship. We never do anything as a family anymore. I try not to be at home and my daughter and I will go out and do things on our own. I am repulsed by his touch and never want to be intimate with him. I feel like I emotionally checked out of this relationship a long time ago. I dont think he loves me anymore but he will not admit it. I always dream of a future without him where I can live in peace. I really want to break up with him but I feel so guilty. I am very worried about how my daughter will react. She really loves him and looks up to him (even though he barely pays her attention). I don't know what to do. I feel like I cannot stay living with him or I will get more depressed and I am worried about my daughters disrespect towards me getting worse. Last time we broke up he moved out to his parents house. He wouldnt be able to stay where we are on centrelink income. I just feel so much guilt and I am so scared. I dont know what to do. I am hoping people on here can give me advice or any stories of people in a similar situation.

PTSD-716,Grounding technique: what are things that make you feel safe around your home?,"Hi, I'm reading a book about trauma, and it has a technique I wanted to share with you and hopefully see what we can brainstorm together. So hopefully most of you are familiar with the 54321 technique, which is a grounding exercise: 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste. This is super handy for when you're out in public but this is an interesting one you can do from home. Find things you can see, hear, touch that connect you to the present. For example, look at a picture or poster on the wall, listen to music that you like, taste something pleasant from the kitchen, and so on. Consider making a list. The point is for you to concentrate on these objects that help you to realise that you are in the present and have available for when you need to ground and orient yourself to the present in your home. I decided to look around my house and some of the things I really like are my book collection, soft blankets, plants (fake and real) and hand cream. Is there anything you can think of that feels really grounding, calming or even just nice to look at around your house? rt",romantic_thi3f,Blue Voices Member,16-04-2021,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/grounding-technique-what-are-things-that-make-you-feel-safe/td-p/30004
PTSD-717,Cptsd and marijuana withdrawls,"Hi my name is B, i am 27 and ive suffered complex ptsd since i was a child. Stating from 4 years old i was constanly sexually assaulted, raped and abused by family members and friends of family, all while having to look after my dying grandmother and great grandmother aswell. After they died i was taken to my auntys house in another state to which sexual assult happened again over and over. I was then placed into numerous foster homes until 16 then i fell pregnant with my daughter. This is just the short version and not everything that happened to me is written here but the amount of pain and confusion these events create for an person is massive. I dont know how to handle life to be honest and i have a huge problem with marijuana disorder due to trying to mask the pain.

PTSD-718,Angry with GP & Clinician,"I recently FOI my psych records for various reasons. I’ve seen 3 Psychiatrists, all diagnoses CPTSD & Bipolar 2. Very clear Hypomania and depressive episodes and PTSD is childhood sexual abuse based and I’ve had eating disorders - fair to say most people are somewhat messed up from childhood sexual abuse? In the records my clinician contacted my GP about medication, fair enough I’ve had Suicide attempts. My GP went on about worried she was about my uni child - this was 2018, he’s left home now “he is too dependent on his mother and she him and each has no supports ” how I have “spoilt my youngest son” um would they prefer I abused them? How she believes in her opinion I have Borderline personality disorder as I change day to day. Yes that called TRAUMA. I am so dumbfounded and struck with anger that my clinician who’s always been a great advocate.

PTSD-719,Trigger: Suicide/Manipulative Room mate has abused me emotionally and caused me significant trauma,"Hi, This is my first time using a forum so.. feel like I'm in unfamiliar territory but i will do my best to explain. I met this person at my second job at the time.. we got along very well, all seemed hunky dory. I allowed this person to crash on my couch due to difficult home situation and i am very caring ( too caring ive been told) and like to help others in my professiaonl duties and personal life. I knew of some underlying anxiety and depression, however did not see the red flags initially. During this time, they attempted suicide in my prescence; and fortunately came out unscaved post ICU. I moved in with my roommate months ago despite this gut feeling telling me not to do it, i did it anyway, feeling obliged given everything that happened and they said id be doing them a huge favour by helping them out. Weeks go by, we have moved into the new place and a second suicide attempt occurs.. more brutal this time in nature.. again in my prescence and came out the other side unscaved. Multiple psychiatric admissions.. more suicide attempts.. and continually providing emotional support.. as the weeks go by. I found myself in a constant state of stress and anxiety.. avoiding her at all cost because she was constantly relying on me and everyone else around her to pick up the pieces for her, manipulating everyone to do whatever she ask because she has severe mental health. This person i found out does in fact have extremely severe mental health and manipulative behaviour is a huge trait of her disorder. I continued to allow her to manipulate me despite it affecting me deeply on a personal level. Feeling like im responsible for her problems. Ontop of everything going on with my living enviroment, i am a shift-worker, driving 40 mins each way to work everyday.. exhausted and unhappy. Despite trying to incorporate healthy boundaries and not be so involved; things have continued to escalate. The emotional abuse and manipulation has reached its peak, and i have had to remove myself entirely, and move out of the rental closer to place of employment for my own sanity and mental well-being. I now am faced with severe verbal abuse, and continued emotional abuse; telling me im delusional and everyone else knows it except you. im starting to feel like I'm well and truly losing the plot. I already have my own mental health problems and grief/loss that i have continued to work through over the years; however never experienced anything like this before.",Kate26,Community Member,04-04-2021,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trigger-suicide-manipulative-room-mate-has-abused-me-emotionally/td-p/527453

I have suffered during my adulthood with relationships, jobs and trusting other people and as time goes on I believe it is all because I was sexually abused. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

PTSD-723,Less than 680 more than 599,"Over the last few weeks I've been struggling. I've had moderately ok to even maybe good, and I've had really bad days. Then last fortnight as I sat in my therapists office I told her I'd calculated that from the age of 11 to 16 the school teacher had abused me around twice a week over a 22 week period over four years. Then in yr 11:- 2 to 4 times a week over a 38 to 40 week period. And that at college it was on a daily basis 5 days a week over a 40 week period. Plus 2 other seperate times outside of school and then at 20 being raped. I just couldn't and still can't wrap my head around that number. I'm not a genius at Maths in fact it was the subject I struggled with the most. So I asked my therapist was I over calculating. Each person was a different occassion and each person abused me multiple times. So was each day it happened a singular attack or were they counted as a whole. Over 599 times but less than 670 was the number we arrived at. Even being cautious I couldn't go lower than 500. I told her my life is a mess. And if I told people I knew what had happened and how many times they'd think I was crazy.

I cry myself to sleep most nights, my kids are always fighting and I just want to walk out on them. Their dad gave up with them a while ago, doesn't speak to them. Maybe I parent out of resentment. It wasn't a good marriage, he isolated me from friends, sexually abused me and wouldn't let me leave the house. Its been 5 years since we split, he had a partner a month after we split and the two of them have dragged me to court for the last 4 years as a way to exhaust me, I always gave them what the wanted.

PTSD-726,"New Here, Old Trauma","Hi, I don't know how to start this post. So I'll just post what I wrote late last night. Hell found me. Once more after many years. It found me but I went looking for it. The flashes of faces in my head just wouldn’t stop. I just wanted them to stop. Why won’t they stop? So on a windy night, after midnight, curled up in my blankets with the big tv still on because I can’t sleep in the dark, I stumbled into purgatory. I’m tired and anxious and shit scared. His face won’t leave me alone. Tap, tap, tap in my memory he goes. It’s so frustrating that I want to cry. His face is there. It’s always there. It’s been in my memory for thirty years. The problem is, I can’t see his features, it’s like something has taken a sheet of course sandpaper to it and wiped it clean. I get snatches of a smile, a whiff of sawdust and cologne. An impression of strong firm hands and shock of white hair. It’s a jumbled puzzle that my brain can’t piece together, because I don’t want to. I’ve been looking for Hell for thirty years and Hell has found me tonight. It found me through an old photo I found online. It found me because the memory is a scab that won’t close over. The photo was there with memories from a history of time. And it wasn’t his face I noticed first. It was his name, listed as the teacher but he wasn’t in the photo. The next time I found him it was those all too familiar clothes and his physique. The third time I found him was in a photo from 1985. Six years before my hell began. It was in a staff photo and there were no names, but I recognised some of the other teachers too. Maybe not their names but there was a familiarity about them. Til I found him, it was that shock of white hair that drew me. The photo was small and as I zoomed in it blurred the faces of every teacher there. Still that feeling of fear from thirty years ago became a living entity inside of me. I froze and stopped breathing. Scared that he would reanimate from the photo and become a holographic nightmare in front of me. Hell found me. Tonight. It found me again because thirty one years ago as I attended school Hell found me. And released a monster into my life that I’ve never been able to get rid of.",Knuckleberry_Poe,Community Member,22-03-2021,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/new-here-old-trauma/td-p/519809
PTSD-727,How do you overcome a fear of intimacy following trauma?,"I am a middle-aged lady now and I cope okay with day to day life, and can pass for a regular person. I rarely think directly of my childhood sexual experiences. But I know that it broke something inside me, and I cope through avoiding triggers, including avoiding close emotional or physical relationships. I gave up alcohol when I was in my early 20's. Since then, I have had one relationship. I really loved him, but it was difficult for both him and me. I was honest about my past and he was respectful of that, but even though we were dating for 5+ years and I made progress in being able to be touched, I still frequently had panic attacks and found I just could not be emotionally present during sex, and instead felt like lump of clay. I was attracted to him, but if I am honest, utterly disgusted by sex. It is very difficult to explain to someone that you find them physically attractive and yet you feel it is impossible for you to touch them, and if they touch you in a sexual way it is sickening. My partner at times experienced my episodes of terror, and they had a deep impact on him (and left me really hollow and exhausted). It was really hard for him to witness the raw pain I still kept in a box down deep, and it made him feel powerless and he also felt guilty for triggering me, though it was not his fault. As a result, he became very anxious and watchful whenever he touched me, which no doubt killed the mood for him too. Eventually I told him I just can't have a relationship, I do not think it possible for me. Yet it was so heartbreaking and lonely. I have not been able to bring myself to date anyone for 11 years. There have been a couple of men over the years that I have grown very fond of, and I am attracted to, but they vanish after a while when kept in the friendzone. I do so want to be able to have a close relationship like other people, but fear I will need to get through life on my own, as I always have.

PTSD-728,C-PTSD: transcending the suffering and finding meaning,"Hi all, I've been reading through the threads and I am stunned at the wisdom I'm finding in there. Tearing up often at people's stories. I hope to make some contributions to this community as I go about healing. I feel like I'm only beginning my journey overcoming the trauma. I have CPTSD (preliminary diagnosis from a psychiatrist) and am currently working on finding a trauma-informed therapist that is bulk billing (fingers crossed). Briefly, my story. I have alcoholic parents who were drunk every night for all of my childhood that I can remember. I was harassed and hounded at all hours of the night, consequently I developed a severe sleeping disorder. My bedroom was not a safe place, and I eventually learnt to block my door with furniture. I moved out to begin university, I was free temporarily, met a woman I loved but in 2013 I was diagnosed with stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma. I was 20 years old. We stayed together for 7 years, but I never fully recovered. She left me, understandably. I have chronic inflammation in my joints, despite being only 27. Vestibular migraines which cause me to be violently ill. I've been living back with my parents the past year which has been hell. So, I've been rather beaten up by life but am desperately trying to get healthy, get my independence and be free. I'm suffering existentially and trying to find a sense of meaning that can sustain me. Confusion and desperation is what I feel. Overwhelmed by complexity. I'm always in a state of chronic hyper-arousal, my sympathetic nervous system is hammering away. It's becoming harder to avoid taking anti-anxiety medication (which is addictive). I've started taking cold showers everyday, to try to switch of the trauma response. It helps. I'm reaching out for help wherever I can. Trying to chart a path that can carry me out of the hell I'm in. I crave insights. I want to know: for those of you much further down the pathway towards healing, what sustains you at your darkest moments? When you feel utterly hopeless, stuck between a rock and a hard place, suffocating? What did you use as your beacon, or your foundation? It would really nourish me to hear. I also want to know: if you could deliver a message to your younger self about what you have learnt, what you believe is most fundamental in treating complex trauma, what things would you direct yourself towards? What things do you regard as irreducibly important to know?

I froze and part of me thought it was alright cause I trusted him but that was what he wanted. I thought I deserved it cause I was so messed up from the first time. Why do I do this to myself I wonder. As much as I was so angry and hateful towards each man, the anxiety of conflict and the need of evidence and talking about it was enough to keep me silent for years. People tell my family is the most important but to me it's to an extent. How can I forgive such a person that did such things to me. I know its not my fault but sometimes I feel like it is, I feel dirty and it had affected me. The amount of times I was attempting suicide was because of it. And the fact that at a such a young age I was already looking at porn and already feeling sexual pent ups that I get anxious or stressed if I don't get rid of it. To this day I feel disgusted with myself cause I had to rely on the same thing that I am traumatised with. I don't know if it is a coping mechanism or a sick game that they left me on. The only time I ever did stand up to myself was when it was my final straw, my mum passed away from cancer and I felt like nothing can hurt as much as losing her. So long story short, my family found out on the day I stared him down and told him to get out of my house. But after that I felt it all went downhill, his sister (my cousin) wanted to 'talk' and she wanted to mediate things. It triggered me and I felt like was what I feared. They asked me what I wanted to do, and I said I dont want to see him ever again and for him to stay away from my family. But I was told I was selfish. I felt so betrayed and to this day, his mum (my aunt) and his sisters come over occasionally and I can't help but get reminded of him.",Yonderly,Community Member,28-02-2021,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trigger-warning-trauma-of-repeated-sexual-abuse-and-assualt/td-p/509579

PTSD-740,How to stop flinching,"Hey all, I have this annoying ongoing problem from a fight that happened almost 2 years ago. I keep flinching when I'm not scared. Like when I'm on the train and it suddenly moves, I flinch. Like full-body flinch that's a bit obvious. I kinda hate it because it reminds me of what happened. Other times I flinch is when: when people come up from behind me and suddenly start a conversation (I kinda jump and yell sometimes too), when someone is walking fast towards me (I flinched twice in a row when it looked like someone was walking towards me in a crowd), and occasionally from the sound of airplanes (airplanes also sound SUPER loud now and put me on edge which is annoying because I'm in a city where there's a lot of them). Most of the time I don't even feel scared or even know why I'm flinching this time, it's just my body doing it by itself, like a body memory. Any tips to stop flinching like this? This is one of the things that really bothers me and I don't really know where to start when it comes to treating it. Like will it get better if I work through what happened a bit more (mentally)? Is there anything specific you can do for this kind of problem? I'm really hoping this isn't permanent.

PTSD-744,My Mum was molested by my Grandfather - not me - so why am I so mad?,When I was 10 Mum started having anxiety attacks. Everything was kept very secretive. I wanted to know what was causing these panic attacks so I started investigating and slowly I pieced things together. Growing up there were lots of rules that only applied around my Grandfather. I became friends with a girl who had the same types of rules that I had grown up with - and her rules were only for when her Grandfather was around. She told me that she had rules but didn't follow them and her Grandfather touched her. It turned out he had done the same thing to her Mother when she was a child. Things started clicking into place and I was able to piece together that my Grandfather had molested my Mum and her siblings. My Grandparents lived in a unit on our property. They were getting old and so Mum and Dad decided to allow them to live next door to us. As kids we would see my Grandparents most days and were always having sleepovers at their unit. I stopped having much to do with my Grandpa and tried to keep my distance. But it was hard when my siblings were always spending time with him too. When my sister said that she was having a sleepover at their house I made myself have a sleepover too just so I could keep an eye on the situation. I felt that I had to protect my siblings. The thing that I am having trouble reconciling with now is - why were allowed to interact with Mum's abuser? Why was he more important than keeping us kids safe? My Aunts and Uncles all kept their children away from my him when they got older so why did Mum and Dad feel the need to have them live with us? Was I not valued and important? Was I not worth protecting? If I knew someone was a paedophile they would not be allowed anywhere near my children. I would protect them at all costs. I don't believe that paedophiles just change and are no longer interested in kids anymore. From everything I have been reading about incest and paedophiles they tend to have a particular gender of child that they target. The fact that my Grandfather went after both his boys and girls makes me think that it was all about the opportunity for him. I wonder if he was just waiting for an opportunity with me and my siblings? Mum and Dad thought that they protected us with all of the rules but what if we hadn't followed the rules and my Grandfather had molested us? Would that have been our fault? It feels like Mum and Dad were leaving that responsiblity with us.,fred4761,Community Member,04-03-2021,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-mum-was-molested-by-my-grandfather-not-me-so-why-am-i-so-mad/td-p/510961
PTSD-745,Is this trauma?,"Kind of a weird one but I guess I’m trying to work myself out here. I had a job, it was an amazing, perfect, well paying job within a local council working with young people. It ticked every box I needed in work however, in true me fashion, I self sabotaged and got greedy. I used my work credit card to purchase food and purchase items I prob didn’t need at work with my own self justifying each purchase at the time as a work purchase. Definitely wasn’t but was used at work. I knew it was wrong but I couldn’t stop myself. It’s like impulse was driving and I was chasing more and more... After a year of worrying, work finally called and asked me to come in and discuss the charges which they discovered. Then put me on suspension with pay while they investigated. I had one major interview, then I had to wait for 7 weeks for the inevitable firing... Which I knew was coming. During that 7 weeks... I sat thinking about how the hell I would handle this. ASIC was mentioned. I had read about people going to Jail for credit card misuse and within a local gov job!? I’m an idiot and I couldn’t stop myself. I fully panicked for the whole time and when the day came to discuss the investigation findings, I knew I was being let go but wasn’t sure if that was it or was I about to be arrested, taken from my family and put through the public ringer? What I did was wrong! I was sacked, told I had to pay it back and that was it. I set myself up with so much fear, then it was as simple as, fired, pay it back, goodbye. It was kept very quiet, I did the right thing and paid it all back immediately, apologised and offered my support to help my replacement be trained up. But I still now cannot go into that town and talk to anyone without fear that they know what happened. I’m embarrassed, ashamed and disgusted in my actions. It was so stupid. The problem is, I still can’t shake the fear that I am about to be arrested for what I did. I’m scared I’m going to be taken away from my son and he won’t have me around for him. I’m scared of police. But I don’t know how to get past this and tbh, I now have a new job and feel constantly like I don’t deserve it because of what I did. Is this trauma? PTSD? Guilt? I’m so confused but too scared to talk to anyone local because the old job I was in, dealt with so many mental health professionals, I just can’t face them...

I have spent my entire life feeling never good enough for people, in the last fifteen years after I left a relationship I have felt more distant then ever.

PTSD-751,How will I know I've changed?,"Hi everyone. So on the brink of divorce after 11 years of marriage, in literally the space of 30 seconds after reading one particular article, I came to realise, genuinely for the first time, that I've been abusive to my wife, the woman I love. It should have been bleeding obvious, but I couldn't see it, despite my wife trying to tell me for years. In a moment, the entire way I saw myself and my marriage fell apart. That was Monday. On Tuesday, I started realising that may not be all of it, and started digging further into my memories and my behaviours. On Wednesday, I came to realise it's been all through our marriage. I wanted her to conform to what I wanted her to be, and would try and steer her away from things she wanted if they didn't fit into my image of our life together. Today is Saturday, and I realised during our separation I've also been very jealous, thinking a lot about where my wife is and wondering who she's spending time with. My wife is safe now, but I'm really in peices, totally unsure of anything. That's a good thing, I need to be questioning everything about me if I'm ever going to change. I'm scared about one thing above everything else though: I successfully fooled myself completely for the last 11 years. In my mind, I was a patient, caring, devoted husband, who went to extraordinary lengths for my wife as she worked through the pain of her own childhood trauma, something we had in common. My wife was my first kiss, first everything. She was, to me, the centre of my life, yet I deluded myself the entire time. I lied to myself fundamentally about who I was, and the very core of my behaviour and attitudes towards the most important person in my life. Why couldn't I see it? How will I ever know if I've really changed, if I'm safe to be in a relationship again, if I can deceive myself so well? How will I know I'm not doing it again?

PTSD-759,Neverendingtrauma,"My whole life has been traumatic. It never ends. It started with sexual, emotional and physical abuse at an early age. I became involved in the sex industry at the age of 14 until aged 39. I was locked away in a children’s home as a child. I educated myself and put myself through university and have 3 professional qualifications. Some years ago I was assaulted by a police woman who threatened to ruin my life and did do so. My career was put on hold for 10 years. I re-engaged in the sex industry. Then I developed late onset schizophrenia. I’ve been well for 15 years and only had delusions. Recently my career was jeopardised because of the false charges the policewoman charged me with years ago. My career is under review. I had an accident at work and was off work for 10 months 3 years ago. I returned to work and had another accident and am awaiting surgery. Then early this year someone smashed into me and I had a head on collision and I’m badly injured and awaiting more surgery. My daughters partner went to attack me 4 years ago. I haven’t seen my grandchildren since they were babies or my daughter for 4 years. We recently connected on Messenger. We are waiting for an intervention order to end in May so we can be a family again. I have a gambling problem related to my trauma. My dog and I have been very sick and I recently discovered it was from a mould. We have both lost our hair and have skin infections. I can’t breathe properly. I’m waiting for weight loss surgery as I’ve put on a lot of weight. I don’t have a sex drive due to medication for my mental illness. I don’t go out. I occasionally talk to someone on the phone. I’m TOTALLY socially isolated with no family or friends to see. I connect occasionally with a few friends over the phone. I haven’t been in a relationship for 10 years. I’ve been a Victim of Crime from my neighbour who has stalked me and threatened me as she is an ice addict. I’ve lost interest in life. I’m on painkillers all day. I can’t read or concentrate to watch TV as I’m so traumatised. I have a psychologist and a psychiatrist but it doesn’t help much. I don’t want to be around people anymore except to gamble. I gave up smoking 11 years ago. I only drink occasionally and I gave up marijuana many years ago. I know the reason I gamble is for escape. I manage my money well though.

PTSD-761,c-ptsd and handling any backlash after a delay in holding people accountable,Has anyone had experience dealing with fall out after finally holding people accountable for their actions? I grew up being emotionally abused by a sociopathic substance dependent violent father and mother who refused to leave or hold him accountable. I've been estranged from my family for 5 years now after finally severing ties. Things were never going to change (I'm now 33). I knew it had messed me up but I found ways of getting on with life. 6 months ago a friends boyfriend indecently assaulted me at their house after a party. I froze. It was interrupted by another friend. I broke down after this. My friend did not leave her partner but stuck with him. My other friend who walked in on it happening told me they didn't want to be involved and go to go therapy. She'd known the assaulter for a decade and this hasn't happened before.... That he was drunk/high Scared to lose friends I pushed down all the hurt and abandonment and went to therapy. 6 months later I'm healing and realising I'm in a co-dependent friendship with a narcissist ... The one of who interrupted my assault but didn't want to get involved. I want these people out of my life. I am trying to prepare myself for the potential response from people.... Why didn't you say something? Why would you stay friends with these people including your assaulter?

PTSD-762,Is this PTSD or severe anxiety (or both)?,"Is it possible to have PTSD if you have had a boss that has bullied and harassed you over a number of years by: * allocating you more work than others (and expecting it to be done before you can go home) * taking higher duties away from you for no reason and giving them to another staff member (along with the pay) * micro-managing your work constantly and 'nit-picking' at small things * refusing to approve leave due to workloads * eventually trying to get you to move departments (and gaslighting it as a great opportunity when you have no desire to etc.) Just that I feel I have some PTSD symptoms just at the thought of returning to the workplace after working remotely for the past 6 months, as I have been given more autonomy (apart from twice daily online 'check-in' team meetings) and felt much happier and productive. Thinking about going back to the same environment again is causing panic attacks, severe anxiety, depression and now insomnia. I am thinking of seeking help of a professional, and perhaps get a letter to enable me to continue the current work arrangement where possible. At the same time, I am worried about dismissal and anxious what others will think or say if I am not at the workplace. Any thoughts or ideas?

PTSD-764,trauma of witnessing my brother die,"i didn't really know where else to turn too, as i am fighting this battle 'some what' silently. i have been really opening myself to trying to accept what happened. my brother only three years old, and was hit by a car right in front of me, when I was eight. I am now twenty three/ almost four. For a long time I blamed myself, as anyone would - but I just have really been struggling with it. PTSD symptoms and severe anxiety have striked me pretty hard since September 2020. My father also died in a house fire. When I was seventeen. My family does not really talk about the grief aspects, which makes it hard as I do not feel comfortable going to them as they seem like they are already over it, which when I brought up that I wrote about the events that occurred the day of my brother accident. Mum told me to accept what happened, I was only eight, and that it's done 'never mind' she kept repeating. Which was hard, and good. But I feel pressure to get over it - when I feel like I just cannot. It is so heavy, and as I saw it happen - I can STILL see it happening. I used to have really bad flashes back to the accident. I am currently on medication as well as awaiting to receive counselling. I am just trying to accept it more - because I am really going through the emotions of it all. Especially, LAST NIGHT my family have kept a photo album of my brother, which consists of images of my brother, dead. A little morbid. But it really took me back, as we were around his body as a family and it was very emotional to look back on, there was also images of him - after the accident took place. Which were very hard to look at, but as I had forced myself to not look at them for years, I felt really strong being able to be there, and attempt to accept it more. But it just hurts so much. And I miss my brother, and my dad just as much. And I am trying to find like-minded people online that are going through remotely the same emotions, because I just feel so alone with it sometimes. A lot of stress and pressure, and I am quite reserved with it all, so if you have read this through to the end - I appreciate it, and any advice you want to share or experiences you feel would benefit my strain and ability to cope - please. thanks, dragon d.",dragondundas,Community Member,02-02-2021,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trauma-of-witnessing-my-brother-die/td-p/532736

PTSD-766,Wife left me due to childhood trauma ptsd,"Hi, the first five years of our relationship my wife suppressed her child abuse and put on a front and was still an amazing person but inside her she was turmoiled. She hates herself and has issues with food. She showed me deep love and we great, or I thought we were. After our child was born she developed anxiety that stemed from her childhood trauma and she sought professional help. She didn't want to pass on her trauma to our child and she had panic attacks. She still takes medication but during the last 5 years she grew distant as I was also dealing with the family courts for a child from my past that I have been estranged from since that child was one. I am a calm person but raised my voice/yelled a few words over a trivial argument but it triggers my wifes trauma and she emotionally vacated her feelings for me. I started to drink and lied about my drinking which triggered her even further. The stress of dealing with my estranged child and my wife was to much at times. My wife couldn't support me as she was dealing with her own issues. I tried to support her but she kept saying it was her own journey. Our relationship remained on life support but after sleeping separately for 2 to 3 years she recently said she doesn't love me any more and we are now in the process of separation. She is still attracted to me but has no feelings of love any more. Towards the end she explained to me the horrific things that she endured as a child and my heart broke for her. She says she wants the separation to remain permanent leading to divorce I guess. I'd be interested to know if anyone hear has had similar experiences me and my wife have had. This is sound destroying and all I wanted for us was to be a happy family. My wife continues to see her professional help, she knows how much I love her. Do you think maybe one day in the future she will heal enough to want me back?

PTSD-769,"Single Mum, ex on IVO","I wasn’t planning a child. I explained that to him and why a month before I found out I was pregnant. I thought I could reason with him logically convince him to let me go, but he wanted control of my entire world. I was shattered i thought i would never get away from him now.I knew as soon as I found out that he would use this child to control my life. I was happy about the baby, but not that it was his. He wouldn’t help me to get a termination but he also wouldn’t discuss co-parenting. The fights were getting worse.The only deal he would make is us together, until he dies raising our child. After some serious concerns about his character I made a very hard decision and left him, again. That’s only a small amount of whats happened but after a stint in a homeless shelter with no back door during my first trimester in and out of hospital with severe migraines i folded and went back, he snapped again and i left. I went back again after the birth because i had nobody to support me, the phone lines weren’t enough, I was so scared. He did it again, I left again. He gaslights me badly, manipulates people and has breached his full IVO multiple times, I have reported it to police. I’m so stressed raising my son, i love him to bits but i have applied for a forever IVO on his father and I’m stressed and distant from baby because of it. I feel like i cant trust anyone.

PTSD-773,"PTSD, gaslighting and what is abuse?","Hi, this is my first post ever on a forum. I was diagnosed with PTSD dissociative disorder with symptoms of depression and anxiety approximately 7 years ago (age 58) as a result of a childhood of emotional and psychological trauma as a result of my mother and sisters. My partner of 15 years has in one way been very supportive. or does he use my mental health against me. If I get angry, which we all do, he tries to tell me and others ""its my PTSD"". I know and tell him there is a difference. He tracks me on my phone "" incase you have an episode"". Hmm they seem to occur mostly with him or when my stepdaughter. Not my imagination here... my son and friends have observed their behaviours towards me. Recently, we moved house 17 December. I had asked him to leave the move until after Christmas so we could spend a week with family which has been hard with COVID. ""No he couldn't afford that leave"". So 2 days after our stuff arrived we had my son, stepdaughter, her partner a 5 year old and 7 year granddaughter here for an early Christmas on 20 Dec. I asked him to leave all excess boxes until after everyone went home. We had bedrooms, kitchen and lounge room all set up. He insisted everything needed to be unpacked... a wall to wall garage of boxes. I begged him this was way too stressful for me... know when I am walking a fine line. His daughter smiled and said she didn't mind helping her dad. My son and I went out... he knew it was too much for me. Arrived home 3 hours later to tables laid out with all the excess kitchen items left for me to sort. Within 2 days I had a massive episode. Not sure if anxiety, PTSD or what. Yelled and screamed and hurled abusat him fighting to get my message across. This was as you can imagine damaged our relationship as I hurled all my negative thoughts ( I think the emotions and thoughts about my mother) at him. great for family! We are slowly getting it together. In discussion I said we could have avoided this extreme pain if he had listened to me and considered my way of handling the move. Said this to his daughter as well. Both responded "" well you would have got unwell anyway!"" and "" what about dad's mental health?"" (true). This is how it always goes they so how do they know I would always get unwell? Is this abuse? Would they do something to someone if they knew it would cause extreme physical injury? Could they be gaslighting to control someone they perceive or want to believe is ""weaker"" then them?

PTSD-774,Narcissistic Parent,"Hi, I've grown up with (who I think) is likely a narcissistic mother (my parents split when I was very young so I've lived primarily with her) and lately I just don't know how much more I can take. I've always struggled a lot with low self-esteem and confidence because of her comments constantly putting me down (except I always thought it was me not her), but this year, during my Grade 12, anxiety and depression took a huge toll on my life and my Mum refused to believe it was a genuine issue and kicked my older sister out of the house when she tried to explain the urgency of my situation to her. I'm now thankfully coming on the other side of my mental health challenges, but still living under the same roof as her is making me start to question my sanity and feel almost like I'm trapped in a prison - I hate being here. Ever since she told my sister to leave, she has lost touch of any sort of boundaries with me (goes through my room, messages my friends without asking me, takes complete control). She's been trying to control my school-life, relationships, future and I just feel like a puppet on a string. When I ask her to give me space, she thrives off the fighting and says comments like ""it's my house I can do what I want"" ""Who are you anymore? Why are you so cruel to me?"" or ""You're a cop-out, you will never achieve anything in life if you treat people like this"". I'm already in a really emotionally vulnerable place, so when she says stuff like this to me it makes me really question whether what she's saying is actually right and if I've been wrong all along - No matter how hard I've tried my whole life, I've never got her acceptance and I don't know why I keep trying - It's a continuous cycle of disappointment, hurt then trying to leave her and live with my Dad, only to be reeled back in with showering of gifts and obligations. So I guess I'm asking if anyone else has been in a similar situation with their parents and what the best action is to do? Is it worth me trying to fix the relationship and be honest with how I feel or should I just leave?

PTSD-775,Does it get easier?,"Venting on recovery process I suppose? I’m 31 years old and two years ago after dealing with growing up with domestic violence and an unstable home life I called my mother out on her partner molesting me numerous times throughout teenage years and early adulthood. It hurt. A lot. Because the only way I have ever dealt with it was to blame myself or that it didn’t matter as long as my mother and sister were happy or keep the family together. But what hurt more was my mother knew. There were multiple times I was the reason for the fighting because I told her, and it always ended up ‘my decision’... I was a kid terrified of losing my family and home. What else was I meant to do? I had started therapy two year ago for depression and anxiety but it wasn’t until later I opened up about abuse. And it wasn’t until that confrontation I really addressed it for what it was. To then be told ‘well it’s your fault, why didn’t you do something’ To me that was the final straw because yes it was all my fault then. I wanted to commit suicide, and I ended up checking myself in. From there I tried to work on things. Therapy stopped due to limits and I just kind of ignored things again? I got work throughout 2019 and I shoved it all down again I suppose? 2020 happened. Isolation makes it so easy to get so worse again. Finally started therapy anew in October and this time round it’s really about the childhood abuse. I’m struggling with PTSD and agoraphobia and just… I either feel nothing. No motivation. I go days without doing anything around the house or looking after myself. Or I feel so incredibly angry and upset. The idea of the outside world is too much. Living is too much. It’s this festering weight on my chest and knots my stomach. It’s horrible. Does it ever get easier? Does working through it all ever get easier? I know feeling it so intensely is because I’ve shoved it down so long and now I’m trying to process it but I’m just so tired of it all... I ended up getting a medical certificate for Centrelink as I’m currently on Jobseeker but it ended this week and I’m agonising over whether I should ask my therapist for another one. I don’t want to be a dole bludger… I don’t want to seem weak or avoiding things but I also know I’m just not well right now and it’s so incredibly frustrating.

PTSD-778,Traumatic Memories - medication,"Hi Guys Im new here and would like the assistance of the collective wisdom/experience of this group. Last year I had medication infusions as a treatment for PTSD (and chronic pain) and then more lately a different medication (primarily for chronic inflammation and pain - but it is also used for PTSD). I suspect that both these treatments have resulted in me remembering aspects of an extremely traumatic event- ones that I previously had no memory of and were locked away in my brain as a coping mechanism. Both these treatments restore neural functioning in the brain and normally this would be a good thing for chronic ptsd and pain but now I am experiencing unwanted memories and intrusive thoughts that are playing havoc with my already fragile mental health - in particular I am getting locked into a dissociative/derealisation state that I cant seem to break out of for hours on end.

PTSD-779,My partner of 12 years says he was raped as a child by his step dad.,"Hi This is pretty heavy. Recently I’ve been struggling with anxiety due to an incident. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression most of my life but that doesn’t make the hard times any easier. I get worried that I can be to self consumed sometimes and well this is just too important for me to mess up. Christmas night everyone had, had a bit too much to eat and drink. My partner and his brothers ALWAYS have “deep” conversations once they get intoxicated. They each have a lot of resentment about their childhood. Nothing about the night was different to every other drunken night they’ve spent together, until my partner exploded and said that he was raped by his step dad and that he knows for a fact that his younger brother was to because he witnessed it. The step dad is biological father to the younger brother. A physical fight started to break out so I just went into action mode to try and seperate everyone and ensure nothing to serious ensued. I feel like I was the only one there who tried to stop the fight - and I got pushed around a fair bit etc. My adrenaline was in over drive- which is not fun for someone who has already been severely impacted by anxiety. Everyone was physically safe after the scramble and I managed to get everyone home safely. My partner wouldn’t really talk to me that night and I didn’t push it either for fear of saying the wrong thing or making matters worse. Boxing Day was a write off and I didn’t try and push conversation with my partner. * I still haven’t brought up the issue with him. How do I even do this ? He’s not usually someone to share his feelings * I’m unsure if this information is true. I have no reason to not believe him. He is not the sort of person to lie about something so serious but what if he was just really really drunk? * What support is out there for men and sexual assault? How can I encourage him to get help? * How do I try and cope with this knowledge? my mind cannot comprehend or compartmentalise this information. This step father is someone who is still apart of our lives and we see him from time to time. Ive been with my partner for over 12 years now and this is the first time I’ve heard about this. It breaks my heart and I feel so incredibly useless and inadequate. I feel lost. I feel guilty that my own issues weigh on my partner and our relationship.

PTSD-780,New member wishing he knew where to start and what to do,"Hi , This feels really strange posting to a message board, after stumbling upon an article about C-PTSD, which bought me to tears, firstly from the kindness I felt in people's posts and replies, but also for hugging myself after reading a thread which made me feel like I was not alone, and that some of my feelings, in some way, were normal. I guess, the thing which really stood out to me from the post I read had something to do with finally being separated from primary abusers, and being in a 'child like' state, which, if I am honest, after a lifetime of trauma and abuse, and finally, being in my own new home, alone - I am so confused as to why I have never felt worse, in so so many ways. My social anxiety, panic attacks, felling's of self worth and depression - have never been worse, which, which I consider what I have experienced in life, is so confusing to me and so incredibly scary. The past 1.5 years have been a massive journey of discovery and learning. After some treatment programs, and a lot of therapy and journaling. I have come to remember and partially understand countless things that have happened to me from childhood until now. My current understanding, is that being raised by a very ill mother, with multiple diagnosis's (and me obviously having my own), lead me down a developmental path, and life, which, is far from normal. The impact of my childhood, adolescence and adult life, during which, most of the time, I was unaware in so many of what was ACTUALLY happening, has caused so many issues, some of which can and have been diagnosed (C-PTSD, OCD, GAD, Attachment Disorder) and others which I would describe as coping mechanism's or behavior's other which I still struggle to understand. The most scary and confusing part is how much I have deteriorated since being alone - I feel like I am only now starting, or trying to understand, how I go about healing and becoming a functional human being. I have no idea what that road ahead looks like, what supports I need, how to go about it, what advice to seek.... and often, feel more confused, lost, lonely, anxious and depressed than I ever have, even when experiencing actual trauma. I understand that everyone's journey is different, and I know there are people far worse off than me... but, these new feeling have caused me to do things and have thoughts I have never had, which I just don't know how to deal with...

PTSD-781,"Really struggling with severe PTSD, Anxiety & Panic Attacks","I’ve been fighting depression most of my life. The last 15 years PTSD and Anxiety/Panic Attacks. I am unable to take medication that affects serotonin and have suffered many hospitalisations due to serotonin syndrome. CBT over the years has little to no affect and I feel at best hopeless all of the time that there is very little that can be done to help me. I really don’t know where to turn or who to ask for help when my psychiatrist admitted he could not help me. There are so many different reasons for my conditions and outside of my doctors struggle greatly reaching out for help, advice or understanding. My biggest problem is my inability to talk to friends, family let alone strangers and I fear my future as my world has become extremely difficult to navigate.

PTSD-782,Coping with child abuse 18 years later.,"Hi, Not sure how to explain myself it’s a subject I can’t even discuss with my partner or family. My sister and I spent our childhood being mistreated and raised in an unsafe environment. With our parents divorced early life was tough especially with drugs and alcohol involved. There are a lot of things kids probably shouldn’t be witnessed to even at an early age of 6. But unfortunately those were the cards we were delt. Now 18 years after I’m married with my own son. And yet everyday for many years I continue to wake up feeling sad and worthless. Some social anxiety and trouble fitting in and communicating with people. I can never forget or let go those bad days my sister and I had. Sometimes I find myself frozen in the car unable to get out. Or laying in bed thinking I should of ended it years ago before starting a family. I know now what not to be when raising my son but I just can never get over it or feel any better.",Bl8ke,Community Member,04-01-2021,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/coping-with-child-abuse-18-years-later/td-p/512427
PTSD-783,PTSD and sleeping IN BED,"I'm nineteen years old, and diagnoses are: anorexia, ptsd, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. I can't sleep in beds!! So with PTSD.... along with many other symptoms, I have this symptom that I can't seem to find any online information on, and I can't find any info on other ptsd sufferers with a similar experience. My sleep isn't great, I'll probably sleep four or five nights a week (not quality sleep) and for the other nights I won't even get an hours sleep... but this is apparently common for people with ptsd. What I CANNOT seem to find info on or relating people, is this other symptom... I CANNOT sleep in my bed (any bed for that matter). If I'm having a good week, I can force myself to sleep ON TOP of the bed, but I haven't slept IN BED (like under the covers and blankets) for about 2.5 years. On a bad week, I can't even sleep on top of my bed, so I sleep on the ground. It's not only my own bed... I can't sleep in hospital beds, other people's beds, etc etc. Has anyone else experienced this??? I feel completely alone and crazy and weird for this and I don't understand why I do it. I've told a psychiatrist about this issue once, but they just ignored it and never asked anything about it... even though it's a huge problem for me. 1. it's not normal, it's weird as all hell 2. I get so so cold at night 3. When I sleep on the ground i don't get a good sleep because it's SO uncomfortable 4. It's been going on for over 2 years.... And I could be wrong, maybe it's not a ptsd symptom, it may be a symptom of one of my other mental illnesses, but I have NO IDEA.",Guest_89,Blue Voices Member,19-03-2017,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-and-sleeping-in-bed/td-p/263292
PTSD-784,Worst year of my life,"This has been the worst year of my life. I left an abusive marriage early in the year, lost most of my so-called friends as they didn't believe me, and felt that as I had not been hit, then it didn't count. as abuse I left with little more than the clothes on my back, moving states, leaving my beautiful pets. I returned to where my adult kids are, had to find a job and somewhere to live, after being retired/carer for 10 years...and then Covid hit. I couldn't get the face-to-face counselling I needed, the human contact I craved, hugs, and many times I spent hours in the phone or online chat to Lifeline, crying for hours. Apart from my mental health, my physical health suffered greatly - I have collapsed and been hospitalised several times, with everything inevitably put down to stress (which is obviously ""better"" than it being heart condition or worse!) I managed to get phone counselling, but although it was good, for me at my age (60) I prefer face-to-face. After 10 sessions, I was told I still needed much more, and advised to see GP for mental health plan. For many reasons this has failed (not the least of which is being told if I didn't take the first appt they offered, then obviously my situation ""wasn't that serious."" I stupidly seek out photos of ex (Facebook etc) which then leads to me spiralling quickly into panic attacks, anxiety etc. He looks so happy. He moved on 5 weeks after I left him. I have nightmares about thinking he's going to kill me, or my family. My logical side knows this man is evil, he is a narcissist who screwed seriously with my self-esteem and mental health, and I am safer not to be near him. But my lonely side misses having someone around, even if I was scared of that person. Fast forward to recently finding a family member semi-conscious following a serious suicide attempt - I have had to compartmentalise the pain of this, in order to focus on helping her. I am scared of what she might do, scared of losing her, scared of saying the wrong thing, scared that I was part of her reasons for self-harm. I put on a brave face around people but underneath, my brain is screaming that I can't take any more. This time of year is full of horrible memories of violence from ex husband last year...I have a lovely kind man in my life recently, who treats me with such respect, but I worry that nobody will ever love me if I can't love myself.

PTSD-785,Will I ever recover from my dads sudden death *Trigger Warning Domestic Violence*,"Hi Everyone, I’m not sure where to start. It’s been two months since the sudden death of my dad and I feel more heartbroken now than when he first died. I feel like I’ll never recover. It’s like I’m drowning in grief. His death has made me face the other things that I am experiencing in my life like domestic violence being perpetrated by my husband. I’ve been suffering abuse for years but I’ve had to hide the abuse from everyone as it’s my shame for putting up with it for so long. It’s a secret which I’ve tried to keep buried deep inside myself but it’s now come to the surface after my dads death. I’ve been trying to hide marks from everyone by wearing really thick makeup and always wearing long sleeves even during summer in 44 degree heat. I believe I’ve been able to hide it all from everyone but now I’ve reached my limit. To try to avoid the worst of the abuse I’m sleeping in my car which is keeping me a bit safer as the nights are the worst. It’s been so cold that I’ve been lucky to get more than 2 hours sleep a night. I’m just so tired. I’m still with my husband as I believe I deserve the abuse. Maybe if I’d let him do whatever he wants to me he wouldn’t hurt me as much. I feel like I don’t deserve anyone to care about me after years of name calling and being put down. I believe that I’m worthless and maybe looking at me does make people ill. Maybe I am lucky to have my husband. I’ve tried to get a counsellor but where I live they don’t want to take on new clients. I’m just really struggling with the awful thoughts that are going through my head. I’m just so very sad about everything. I’m starting to wonder why I bother continuing on with my life when there’s nothing to live for anymore. My dads death has made me realise that without the close bond we had I now have no one else to talk to. My mother isn’t someone I can talk to as we never got along. My dad was the person that was a buffer between us who stopped us fighting. I understand she’s grieving too but it’s different with her as she’s already talking of dating again even though she was married to my dad for 51 years. I’m sorry about the length of this post but once I started opening up about the awful things I’m experiencing it all just came flooding out. It feels so good to be able to talk about my life anonymously.

PTSD-786,Struggling to cope,"Hi, im not really sure how to say this or how exactly how this works sorry. I have always been the one to help others and don't get me wrong i love helping others, but its come to the point in my life where i have realised that i am really struggling to cope! i have grown up with many traumatic experiences. About 2 months ago i was in a high speed single vehicle motor accident where i got airlifted to the hospital, since the accident i had friends and family who mean the most to me walk away as it caused a massive fight with my friend who was in the wrong (which she caused the accident) and facts and reports were miss understood. We were told that I'm lucky to be alive and if we were going any faster we would all be dead and top that all off i was forced to move states because my mum knew i wouldn't be able to cope being alone but in all honesty right now i feel more alone then ever. I have no family or friends where i am and I've been separated from my sibling because they are back in my previous state, it its honestly the hardest not having anyone and I'm struggling and don't know what to do, Christmas and not having family around was the worst! my anxiety, depression and PTSD has been playing up the worst and my medication is starting not to help, how do y'all cope with this stuff!?

PTSD-787,Coping with Christmas when things aren't jolly?,"Hi, I couldn't seem to find a post like this so I thought I'd make my own. Christmas is a time for a lot of families to get together and a lot of gift giving and happiness- but I don't really have that, and I'm hoping I'm not alone in it. To stay anonymous here I'm not going to give much detail but basically every year I go and see them as family tradition. Breaking that tradition is going to cause more harm than good even though I've thought about that a lot. They live further away so it's not really possible for me to leave early either, and I can't afford to stay at a motel - so I end up staying overnight with them. It flairs up my trauma like no tomorrow and there's no real gap in between so it's so hard to stay grounded. I also tend to forget that I'm kind of an adult now and I end up feeling like I'm back there again. I'm in therapy too but it feels like all of that goes out the window. I might be logically in a better place (because I don't live there anymore), but it's almost like I forget everything. Does anyone have any coping strategies?

PTSD-788,missing mum during this holiday season,"Hi, my brother, dad and i witnessed my mum have a brain aneurysm a month ago which was absolutely terrifying to see my mum in such a state of health as before she was a healthy woman. This trauma extended to seeing her with tubes and machines in the icu for a week. She is now progressing very well with her rehab but it is just completely changed my families life as we are trying to adapt as it would take her a long time to hopefully get back to normal again. But it's just sometimes i try to do the little things like cooking dinner that just make me miss her even more because thats the stuff she usually does and was going to teach me now that i have finished school. things like cooking dinner also sometimes bring me back to the moment where my brother and i found her in her condition 4 weeks ago because we found her in the family room across the kitchen.

PTSD-789,New to C-PTSD and learning to cope *Trigger warning: Self harm*,"Hello, I am quite new to C-PTSD, I was officially diagnosed 4 months ago. In that time I've spent a week on a psych ward and a month at a Step up Step Down/mental health rehab accommodation. I've also weaned off a medication I've been on for the last 15 years, under the guidance of the hospital Psychiatrist. I had quite a traumatic discharge experience from the mental health rehab two months ago and things have spiralled since then. In this time I've also been assaulted and gone to police over an indecent assault but neither had enough evidence to charge. I feel I have exhausted the mental health system and have given up hope of any recovery by utilising it. My counsellor had told me it's not a good system to have to rely on and now I can see why. Especially being in a rural city, I went to school with half the nurses in ER and I am over having my issues spread around publicly by going into the tiny ER. I was sectioned and my abuser found out about it because there was someone in ER he knew. He then used this as evidence that I'm crazy and to further degrade my self esteem. I have found self harm is helping as is casual sex where I don't know the person and they don't know anything about me or what I'm going through, I can pretend I'm not unwell for a few hours. I have PMDD and will be getting symptoms this week. I don't want to go to the ward. Does anyone else have any coping mechanisms I can use at home during this time?

PTSD-790,EMDR & Neurofeedback for PTSD / Childhood Sexual Abuse - Tic Disorder - anyone tried this?,"Hi guys, Long story short, when I finally told my family about my childhood sexual abuse from a family relative at the age of 24, which unravelled a bunch of negative/seriously stressful outcomes and a few weeks on, my top right lip (and right lip and right eye) started to twitch and spasm. This was 5 years ago (and many tests/therapies later) and since then the spasm has moved into my neck and back and now foot (with pain from the tightness/spasm!)....dystonia, tourettes...who knows. The spasms also come with a feeling of intense panic and chest tightness. I've recently tried EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) for past trauma which has helped me cognitively reframe memories with new empowering narratives however the tic/spasm is still there (pain with this is the biggest issue). Next week I have my first Neurofeedback session which I'm pretty hopeful about. I definitely have issues focusing and regulating mood/emotions so am hoping this will help to calm the nervous system and therefore help to resolve the tic...maybe. To note, I also had seizures as a child which I now know are related to the trauma. Does anyone have similar issues with facial pain/tics? Has anyone tried neurofeedback for PTSD / tics and if so, have you seen any benefit? I'm also looking to document this experience so let me know if you have any questions!

PTSD-791,Looking for some online reading,"Hi all, I suffered childhood sexual abuse and have been working with a psychologist for around 7 months and she is great but is having four weeks off over Xmas. I did a few sessions with CASA (centre against sexual assault) but they said I wasn’t in a safe place in my relationship to continue with them at the moment. It has been put to my attention by quite a few professionals that my partner can be abusive, particularly emotional/ verbal. I have been in and out of denial about it for a while but I am starting to accept some of his behaviours aren’t ok. The thing is though I think a lot of it does stem from my history of abuse especially sexual and that is one of the main areas I suffer in our relationship. He puts a lot of pressure on me to regularly be intimate even after I have been triggered and if I said no he was so grumpy to the kids and I and yelling at us for the smallest things so I would just give into him to try and keep everyone happy BUT after a long journey he is slowly accepting that him putting that pressure on me isn’t fair and he is trying not to be as forceful and dominating but I still feel that obligation to satisfy and give into his sexual needs and I’m wondering if I can find a good link connecting that to my childhood abuse (I have never had a healthy sexual relationship, I almost feel like I need to go back to the start and learn what healthy and safe sex is.

PTSD-793,Dehumanising experience at doctors,"Today I drove 3 hours to the doctors to get my psych re-evalutation. I am falling apart. It's official, I'm experiencing anxiety at unprecedented levels. To get there wasn't easy. You see I had to travel with my husband whom I'm on the brink of breaking up with...the icing upon so much trauma it doesn't even bear thinking about. The necessity for this second dr's trip was because the first time, said husband had a melt-down and punched a car in the street... all before my all important dr's appoint. Yes, I felt I had been purposely derailed. Needless to say, I'm a blithering mess at the appointment and the dr gives me meds and walks me to reception to make the next appointment. Next appointment (today) I arrive and they've changed dr's on me, and as he isn't my normal dr, said he couldn't give me a psych assessement so I can get a referral for some much needed help. Again I'm a blithering mess with this unknown dr today, who instead of apologising to me, just rings the receptionist and blasts her instead. Between tears I explain it's a 6 hour round trip and I don't have my own transport. On a positive note the meds are starting to help; they make me feel vulnerable thinking that I need to rely on them, so I was stubborn to seek help again on this front.

For me it is not as it trigger for my PTSD and although hate is a strong word it is the only word I can think of. Growing up it was just an excuse for the men (fathers family) to get drunk and treat the women as second class citizens. The men drank and the women work and there were often fights and jealousy between brothers, sisters and cousins. As the eldest grandchild there was an expectation on me that due to constant physical abuse I could not cope with. I will be with my mum, stepfather and a friendly uncle this year but unfortunately my stepfather is extremely jealous of anyone who spends time with mum especially me. He is belittling and emotionally abusive and although I am better at not letting it get to me it does from time to time. In fact a few years ago I was so close to lashing out but I didn't and for that I am very proud of myself. He once said to me ""there is someone in MY house I wish wasn't here"" obviously meaning me.

PTSD-801,trouble after divulging to my parents **trigger warning - sexual abuse**,"Hi there. Thanks for looking. I have a problem with my family since I divulged I was sexually abused by my brother when I was 10-12ys old. He is 5 years my senior. Another girl, who lived near us growing up - came forward & said she was abused by him, & when my parents told me she came forward - I took the opportunity to say ""me too"". At first I thought the response was quite good. My mother said ""I'm sorry that happened to you"" and my father was absolutely mortified. As time has moved on (3 years since I told them) I have tried to broach the subject & these comments were the responses (yes - I practically remember word for word): (1) This is very embarrassing for the family, please don't tell anyone (2) let's bury this in the back yard shall we? (2) we think you might have ""false memories"" (3) you are torturing us. You didn't tell us - so whose fault is that?! We would have done something if you had of told us! (angry tone) (4) & finally, just a couple of months ago ""just get over it!!"" in a very hostile tone - both of them said it twice & then they hung up on me, so we haven't spoken since So I bought it up with them those 4 times in the last 3 years. Obviously they are finding it difficult to handle. I was hoping they would help me heal - yet it's not going as planned! Was I expecting too much? I feel like I want to cut ties because perhaps they care more about their reputation, than their child's wellbeing, and then I consider well - I have damaged their wellbeing. And then I consider - only one person is at fault here, which is NOT me! I do wish I had never told them now. I do feel -not speaking up- is not exactly the best course of action either - and I'm worried he has done this to more survivors. I feel they are blaming me, or they just don't want to know. It doesn't help that the abuser is now a dr & he was the golden child, and he lives close to them & is in their ear suggesting this ""false memory syndrome"" They don't believe he abused the other girl in my street - so that's 2 of us they say they don't believe? On another occasion he was caught peering through a window at myself and another kid when we were in the bath when we were in 5th class. But I have no idea if he got into trouble for that or not - I think my mother just didn't tell my father Any advice? thanks for listening",b_abbey,Community Member,30-09-2020,PTSD and trauma,21,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trouble-after-divulging-to-my-parents-trigger-warning-sexual/td-p/520320
PTSD-802,Coping with anniversaries.,"Hi Just after some advice on how to deal with anniversaries as they come around. It’s 3 years tomorrow since I was sexually assaulted and over the past weeks my stress and anxiety has been taking over. I also keep dissociating and am having really horrid body memories and flash backs. So I don’t like to sleep either. I know I have many tools I can use to try and get through this time safely, but once I’m upset I find it hard to remember anything I’ve learned. I feel a bit like going insane. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",Slipperyfish,Community Member,07-12-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/coping-with-anniversaries/td-p/531612
PTSD-803,Alone depressed confused greaving,I met the mother of my children at age 23 and was with her for 7 years. We have 3 kids together. The last pregnancy she became very nasty towards me and also very sexually promiscuous. I was working 12 hour days and she was seeing another man on the side. I still stayed with her and two months later my baby boy was born and he was absolutely perfect in every way. Mum had complications with the cesarean and got sepsis. I took time off work and cared for our newborn while she got better. 2 months after our sons birth she seeing this other guy again and even introduced him to our children while I was at work. I was tired and stressed and heartbroken and I moved out to show her I'm not going to put up with her crap. She moved interstate a week later and got an AVO against me so she didn't need my consent moving the kids interstate. 3 months after she left I get a very distressing phone call from the hospital telling me my that my baby boy was found with severe head trauma and his heart had stopped. there was a 75% chance he is going to pass. The cause was mum got with yet another guy and left my baby boy alone with this monster. My baby was upset and was crying so this creature hurt him. When I walked in to the ICU he was unrecognisable and was on life support. I was told all he will ever be is lungs breathing and a heart beating. 6 months has passed and he is still with us but extremely disabled. The kids were taken off their mother and because she mentioned drugs in the AVO(iv been clean for 7 years) they weren't brought back to me either. They are temporarily in the care of the grandparents but all 3 will be moved to a foster home soon. Child protection services told me i couldn't cope caring for my son his needs are to high. This has really broke me. Some days the waves of emotions I feel when I think of what my baby went through is torture. Several times now iv passed a mother pushing a newborn in the supermarket or down the street and I just burst into tears. I don't have any family for support and have been trying to get through this on my own. I don't know if helps talking about it or it just makes it worse.,Frenchy89,Community Member,08-11-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/alone-depressed-confused-greaving/td-p/513303

PTSD-806,Hi,"I only just joined and had no idea what to say or were to start. I went to a psychologist years ago and was diagnosed with extreme PTSD due to a lot of things I saw and did while on serving nearly 30 years ago. I also had a rather interesting childhood with an abusive alcoholic step father who did things that I cannot describe here. I never went back to the psychologist because I was afraid he would have me locked up in a mental ward of some sort. So for the last few decades I have been trying to treat and control this myself. You would be amazed at how well I have been able to hide my condition. My wife knows but like me she is powerless to help. She is though always there for me and that has gotten me through a lot of ""situations"". Its nice to think that there are services available and what not but what services don't involve me getting the sack from work for being mentally unstable? I start every day wanting to end it all and by the end of each day I find I'm too gutless to go through with it which then makes me want to plan out my demise for the next day and so on. On the one hand I know there is help available but even one day off could see me out of work and then my wife has the burden of having to work longer hours just to keep us fed and housed. My condition is not hers to bare. I want to describe the daily things that I go through but its no different to whats millions of other people go through and have already spoken about so I will spare you all that BS. I'm not sure what else to say or what I even wanted from this post to be honest.",mrmonaro,Community Member,04-12-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/hi/td-p/530274
PTSD-807,Just putting this out there. Hi and keep smiling...I’m trying...,"???? That’s my life right now. If I was honest it has been my life up until now anyway. My future is now ??? I was diagnosed with Lymphoma about 5 months ago. It was every where in my body. Now after 6 Chemo treatments it seems to have cleared but I won’t know for sure for a few more months. I still have 2 cycles to come that require hospitalisation. The effects of the chemo haven’t been terrible but they have affected and changed my body. On top of that I have PTSD. Had it most of my life. Which is why my life up until now has been ?? Always feeling that I’m better off dead. Not possessing the confidence to achieve financially or socially. A lifetime of acidic anxiety has a lot to do with that. Always running away or avoiding anything that I would feel is overwhelming. At 9 my father and sister were killed in a family car accident. When I was 18 my mother died and I felt guilty. I’ve had two marriages and a long term defacto relationship by the time I was 44. When my 2nd wife cheated on me I gave up on life. So I started living out of a car for several years until I felt that I wanted to try a normal life again. Then I rent/shared a house but within 3 months all my laptops and camera gear was stolen. I continued renting for a few more years, became complacent. Living week to week and never saving anything despite working full time. So I decided to return to van living again to at least be able to start buying a few things instead of taking out cash loans that only ended up putting me in more debt. Then in March 2020, Covid came to Oz and work asked all vulnerable team members (me) to stay home with reduced pay. So definitely no complaints there. So I camped out till June in the van and decided to start renting again with my partner of a few years. On the day I picked up the keys to the flat. I had back pain. Week later I was in hospital then found out that I have cancer. I am 51 years old feeling like 90. Feeling fat, sick and hopeless. Last month a pace maker was implanted to prevent my heart from stopping again and my depression is now coming back big time. I don’t see the point any more. Can I return to work after treatment? How will I get by if I can’t? What if I only have a few years left to live? How would you want to spend the rest of your life if you knew there was a good chance you would die within 3 to 5 years.

PTSD-808,I don't know how to make it stop,"I am a victim of domestic violence perpetrated my ex-husband. My 5 year old is impacted. His medical and therapeutic teams are impacted My current parter is impacted. My abuse started after the relationship ended. I ended things and got a DVO because he couldn'tet go, and his life's mission is to pretty much destroy me, and it's working. I feel broken. Most of my abuse is systemic as he knows he can't directly abuse me, so he does things like make frivolous complaints about my sons teachers to the board of education, reporting our GP to the medical board, calling the police to say I abused him even when he chooses to live 2 states away, calling child safety to say I've abused my son. Yesterday I had the Police at my door because he wants to remove my son from the DVO. I have to court to court in January. He put in an IO application against my parter to say that he is intimidating and we have to go to court in January for that also. They have never physically met! My partner has a disability and isn't a threat to anyone. We are also fighting in the family court and have a court report in my favour outlining my ex husbands mental health issues and indactsting that he us domestically violent, and recommends reduced time but our trial is 9 months away. No one will acknowledge this report until then. Between all the lies and court cases and I am being mentally, financially and emotionally drained. My son is being affected because his therapy team are pulling out. They don't want to lose their registrations over my ex complaints. I keep screaming out for help and no one can help me, especially not the Police. Everytime I go to them he just gets smarter and more covert. Now that the borders are open, I genuinely fear that he will hurt my son during a visit one day just to hurt me. I am scared and drained and no one can help me. I've reached out to DV specialists, lawyers, psychologists, and even my local MP who can do nothing for me. The only thing I've been told I can possibly do is put in an injunction with my lawyer tonstop him from talking to my sons specialists but it will cost me $20k with no hope of success. That is on top of the $65k I already have to pay in legal fees next year that I can't afford. I tried. I even sold items in my house, saved frugally, even started a go fund me and nothing worked.

PTSD-809,Jealousy over other's happiness,"Hi all, Recently I have been trying to cope with a strange jealousy. I am not even sure how to name it. And I think it is completely unreasonable. The thing is, that I am jealous of the teenagers in my community, all the support they receive from the adults, friends they are surrounded with. For some reason it throws me to time when I was a teenager and didn't have any of it. Instead I had verbally and emotionally abusive mother, passive father, violent partner and bunch of bullies at school. And they are lovely kids, I am also going to support them as much as I can, and they did absolutely nothing to me, and I am not going to pour any of my frustration with my past on them, because it would be completely unfair.

PTSD-811,PTSD not sure how much more I can handle,Hi all. First time poster here but would appreciate all the advice I can get. I suffer majorly from PTSD from so many majors events that have happened in my life I wasn’t raised in the best household and have lots of torturous memories of being raised by abusive parents my dad was an alcoholic. But the main things that have caused further issues for me mentally was in 2016 I Almost lost my eldest daughter to a brain bleed. We have since been given the good news that the treatment she had for it 3 years ago was successful. We were overseas by ourselves when this happened so I barely had any support my main issue now is this. Almost 2 years ago my partner was involved in an accident on his way home from work. He was riding his bike along the bike path when a vehicle connected with him. He came flying off head first into a pole suffering a broken neck. Broken tail bone and 4 fractured discs in his back. I have been his main support person. Whilst I’m truly thankful that he is alive and walking and all. The emotional outbursts I suffer from him I don’t know how much more I can take. I don’t understand the physical side of pain he has experienced but can definitely understand the emotional and mental side as this has effected us both. Our relationship has changed in many ways. We can’t do even a quarter of the things we used to because of his injury. Yet why do I have to be the one that has to take the anger outbursts over literally nothing. I’ve also had some physical damages because of these outbursts. I want to help him badly but I shouldn’t have to handle these alone.

PTSD-813,How do I stop fighting with my mum?,"So recently my mum, sister and I moved to get away from our emotionally abusive father. I'm not going to go into detail what he did but he is generally very controlling, manipulative and can't admit whenever he does or says something wrong. My mum and I have always been pretty close and never argued much but recently we've been disgreeing on a lot more things. For example, recently we went on a holiday and I was worried about leaving my cats at home (partly because we had just moved and partly because I've developed some sort of paranoia about something happening to them after multiple of them dying and also my father's threats to hurt them). Anyway, I was probably in a bit of a bad mood because of it but for some reason my mum took it the wrong way. On the way back we had an argument I don't remember exactly how it went but my mum said that I had been sad the whole trip and said something like ""I'm still not allowed to do anything!""referring to how my father would try to stop us going places. So basically comparing me to my narcissistic father. I also recently deleted my instagram account because I wanted to separate my art account and my personal account (I can't explain why exactly, I just didn't like having them combined) but my mum saw this as a personal attack on her as if I didn't want her to see my art, which isn't the case at all. And when my sister and I try to explain things to her that she doesn't understand she gets offended and says things like ""Ok, I'm sorry! I'm such a terrible mother, you just hate me.."" I know it probably stems from trauma but I don't like how she seems to take it out on me. I don't think I'm saying or doing anything terriblr but I'm also scared to turn out like my father so maybe I'm doing it unaware. I just don't know why this is happening it just feels stupid that we're arguing after the situation we came out of but I don't know how to stop it.",yutajp,Community Member,22-11-2020,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-do-i-stop-fighting-with-my-mum/td-p/520235
PTSD-814,"A year after the attack, I’m still so angry, hating myself, pushing people away,","Hi all. I’ve read some posts here and it’s been pretty good to feel connected and read of shared experiences, but I thought I’d put some words to my own pain. Part one I hate myself. Hate how I look. Hate I can’t have another identity. Even this nasty self-talk reminds me of the attack from over a year ago – saying to him, “I’m ugly, I’ve put on weight, go have sex with your wife”. It’s a horrible cycle. I know I’m not symmetrical but I can’t get over this disgust, I’m sure it’s 90% valid, objective. I’m considering getting a nose job (and fillers, eye lift) which just fills my feed with dreams of being less disgusting. I’m afraid it’ll be too painful and expensive, and I’ll still look ugly. I want to hide. That’s the crux of it. Second part It’s not fair. I was raped in France, the police were revolting then and afterwards – they literally misplaced my case. And he’s not charged. His family never has to believe what he did to me. My friends, a year in and knowing all the details, still get to question why I’m not friends with those ‘friends’ who didn’t support me. I’m beyond angry and just over it. I’ve withdrawn. I could tell them but why? Another average conversation, seems like I’m upset. Are they even worth it, if they’re asking that? Final/background I was on the trip of a lifetime, visiting a very old friend, throwing in some extra visits to meet his fam too. One drunken night, the only night in the entire trip where I just stupidly trusted and let loose, after vomiting on myself, I pass out in my bed in his spare bedroom. I’m only half aware of him fooling around with his wife next to me, like what the hell, I’ll just ignore it. And then he starts raping me. The first French policewoman I spoke to said it’s hard to rape a woman. And there’s nothing I can do about it – not now, from the safeness of my Australian bedroom. The embassy helped translate but it’s now up to me to find a costly French lawyer if I personally want to pursue it? Well. That’s some of my story.

Anyway, we barely touched touched the surface yesterday. In fact, it wasn’t even discussion of the trauma that triggered me. I was really anxious & I shaking so she asked me to breathe (as in my deep breathing exercises). But I couldn’t doing it if she could see or hear me. I don’t understand why, I don’t understand why I felt distressed, I don’t know why it was so hard. In the end she had to turn away from me & put her headphones in & play music before I could do it. i feel like such a failure because I can’t even live a normal life, or be “normal”. Can’t imagine anyone else being as stupid as me & not being able to to do some deep breathing in a room with someone else. It’s weird because when we talk I don’t have any issues looking at her or making eye contact, but something about the breathing triggers me. so we spoke about other things for a while & then she said she wants me to do just one thing. She wanted me to inhale loudly through my nose & then exhale loudly through my mouth. And this distressed me so much I started crying. She explained that we need to dig a bit deeper to find out the reasons behind it, but when she asked how I was feeling I didn’t know. I can’t explain why it’s happening. I just wanted to cry. i feel so stupid. I don’t know if there is anything behind this but I feel so distressed. I feel like my depression is so ready so come back.

I’ve realised I’m putting in a lot more than I get back in terms of life responsibilities, making effort with family, selfless acts etc. I think my boyfriend has started to feel me drift and a few times he’s made remarks to the effect he would kill himself, or me, if I ever tried to leave. He has a really dry and dark sense of humour but the comments make me really uncomfortable because I was previously in an abusive relationship. Although, I don’t think he’s suicidal, I’m feeling scared and really don’t know how to go about the break up. He lives at my house but has contributed financially to a few things in the past 6 months. Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

PTSD-818,Recovering from bad fights with partner/anger issues,"Hi there, I've never posted on here before... I just wanted to ask for some perspective or advice... Ive been with my partner for nearly 3 years and he is a wonderful boyfriend. However, throughout our relationship we have had some very heated fights, and it has led to his anger getting worse and it resulted in him physically hurting me and saying very hurtful and spiteful things. He feels so bad about what he has done, and as I am someone who has made mistakes too and lived with mental health issues, I have compassion that nobody is perfect. He truly treats me so well outside of these moments. But I am struggling as I feel shame to share my story with anyone as people will so often tell me to just leave, like its all that simpe. But its not. I am having trouble moving through the emotions, trauma and pain this has all caused. I feel we both had to change our ways and learn to communicate better with one another which is why things have gotten better lately. I am afraid though that it would only take me slipping up to cause a bad fight and him to react with his hostile ways. He said he is willing to work on himself and wants to rid these parts of himself. We are both spiritual and open minded and I have hope for us, but i want to know what is the next best steps? Couples therapy? I have suggested individual therapy too. I do have trouble even talking to therapists about all this though as the stimga is so high on domestic violence (as it should be). I don't condone any violence. But i do have a big heart and want to grow with my partner but also never be scared of him again.

I have moved interstate I am a prisoner in my own home scared of people I don't know terrified of crowds. And above all absolutely NO TRUST or FAITH in the police. I was made to feel it was my fault l blame myself they found my mental health meds in my bedside table and assumed I'd lost the plot. It has cost me more than I could have ever anticipated I understand why women don't report it pull out throw their hands in the air walk away refusing to take the matter any further. I understand what it's like to be made to feel it was your fault, you asked for it I know what it feels like recounting your story to every bloody police that crosses your path afterwards doing a photo ID of the person seeing the likeness staring at you from a computer screen. I know this and much more and I hate it, that one person could cause this to happen. I hate myself for allowing it to happen for trusting a uniform we are taught to trust I hate the thought that one day I may need to call them for help that I will never ever make that call no matter what.

PTSD-820,Looking for Support and a place to feel safe........,"Hi, This is my first time on here - I've just been diagnosed with Complex PTSD by my psychiatrist. I'm also three years sober and to be honest I thought my thoughts, anxiety and fears were related to the disease of alcoholism as some are similar. I've had childhood sexual abuse, emotional abuse from early teenage relationships, domestic violence in a relationship in my 20's where I was physically assaulted and other episodes of sexual abuse in my 30's. It all makes sense - I'm constantly frightened in the world, I can't seem to express myself or have a voice, I'm constantly on edge and hypervigilant with all my surroundings, I'm never really comfortable. I can't seem to relax and be myself and find most people a threat. My body tenses up with anxiety and I'm never present, always in the future. I life my life in fear. I know now this is Complex PTSD from multiple traumas. I'm glad I have a diagnosis now but am scared of facing life and wonder how I'm going to get through this when I've lived my life this way my entire life, it's all I know. I don't even know who I am anymore and what my identity is. My psychiatrist is going to help me with treatment, I feel lost and afraid - it's lonely and I can't connect to other people out of fear. If anyone can suggest anything that has helped them, I'd love to hear from you. I'm 43 years old, female, single with no children, I just want this to go away and have the time to heal.

PTSD-821,Partners of DID systems.,Gosh where to start. Our life looks so quiet from the outside but truly it is chaos Just below the surface. I'd dearly love to hear some positive stories and strategies reguarding moving forward with a DID system for partners (12 alters) and regular family life. The host I married is gone but there are a few whom I'm close with since then. (4 years ago next month) they don't therapy but instead work on their head themselves. They are also highly intelligent autistic folks. I run into problems often with my communication issues As I'm clinically depressed and highly anxious myself. I have a tendency not to share everything. I'm a quiet person naturally. This really bothers them. Is there anyone out there who gets it. Knows how complex this kind of relationship is?,Shirogane,Community Member,22-10-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/partners-of-did-systems/td-p/537157
PTSD-822,I live with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder)  & I have struggled most of my life with relationships,"My names Vanessa & Im a single parent living in country Vic. Ive been diagnosed with BPD since 2009. I was previously diagnosed with Depression prior. Its been a very diffcult journey for me, especially prior to being diagnosed with BPD..BPD is one of the most complicated & complex Mental Illness you can have. Most of the trauma that happened to me, to trigger my mental illnesses (my BPD) occured when I was a teen that sent me on a spiral of self medicating with self distructive behaviours, & ruining my first serious romantic relationship. I havent felt good enough in my own skin for most of my life, & still dont. So as the years went along, I saw therapist after therapist, with most of it not really helping me till 2009, when I was offically diagnosed with BPD. Then 16 yrs ago I met a man whom had narcasstic traits that I wasnt even aware off. He soon became my ""favourite person"" & wanted to be loved so desperately. Life seem good & this man whom I was besotted with...6 months after being together I found out that I was pregnant. What a huge & delightful suprise, but not known to me after this man found out I was pregnant, he changed....We started fighting alot & he started to become verbally abusive with me....I didnt know what was happening at the time. I started to resent the way his was & see that he was had very narcissistic traits.. So after my beautiful baby boy was born, the relationship with my sons father really turned bad & not only did more veral abuse start, the physically abuse started too. I was very confused & eventually reached out to the Domestic Violence Support Group. It certainly opened my eyes to the fact that I was dealing with domestic violence. So after that, after about 3 yrs I wanted out of this toxic relationship with my sons father. But he certainly didnt make it easy for me to leave. So many AVO""s & court appearances drove me insane. All these huge difficult issues made my BPD SO much worse, which I didnt even realise at the time...I have suffered quite alot of other traumas in my life also, with a parent who im sure has BPD as well, my mum & a dad who invalidated my feelings & emotion most of the time. Even though I have gone through alot that I wasnt prepared for & have survived quite alot, I still feel very lonely, to scared to get in a relationship again & misunderstood. Can you relate & understand my story??",lochness46,Community Member,02-11-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-live-with-bpd-borderline-personality-disorder-i-have-struggled/td-p/510468

It’s been 4 months since I started talking with the lawyer and we still don’t really know what’s going on.

PTSD-824,Mother with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Struggling.,"Hi all, I could not sleep even though I'm utterly exhausted so thought to get my thoughts out here. I am 40 years old. Late in December last year I finally realised my mother had been abusing me for a long time. I decided to cut all contact virtually immediately. I do not regret that. Last night I came to the full realisation my mother has Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Reading about daughters of mothers with NPD finally put some pieces of the puzzle together. I have a name now behind the reasons for my mother's abuse of 34 years towards me. I have read that many don't discover this till later in life. I KNOW now it was definitely abuse and an explanation for mother's cruelty to me. No wonder my therapist said it is like you have been brainwashed in some terrible cult. She did not know my mother has NPD either. I'm truly struggling with this. Many pennies dropping at once and my head can't stop spinning. I am feeling beyond angry. NPD is a horrible disorder. The thing is they are never responsible for anything. Anyhow this is very new territory for me sadly.

He didn’t apologise or anything to me but after a few weeks we moved on. Today we had a big argument, he doesn’t like one of my friends and gets annoyed when I hang with him. He’s heard rumours about him from family members which are lies, and I told my dad they are lies but he believes them. I told him that I am 20 years old , and that I am responsible for my own decisions , and you can’t pick and chose who I am friends with because I’m not a child.

PTSD-828,Partners CPTSD + Past sexual abuse trauma support,"Hi all, This is my first time posting after reading through a lot of your posts which have been helpful in understanding my partner. My partner was groomed and abused as a young teenager for many years, recently they have reported it to the police and they are going through the painful process of re-living the trauma by gathering evidence and giving statements. Our relationship was really healthy before but there has been such a change now I can't quite keep up with it. Although still a healthy relationship, my partners anxiety is almost engulfing her for the majority of the day. I am unsure how I can support her when she is clearly anxious, having flashbacks and panic attacks. Her mood was never as low as it has been, she is on the wait list for CASA but there is a delay. I am letting them vent all frustrations, giving them as much space as they need/want. Also our sex life has took a nosedive, I understand that sex is pretty far off for us but I miss the intimacy. My partner hasn't verbally recognised this and I don't want to bring it up incase I make her upset. Any information or guidance on how I can support my partner would be really helpful.",sead05,Community Member,02-11-2020,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/partners-cptsd-past-sexual-abuse-trauma-support/td-p/510243
PTSD-829,Do I have PTSD?,"So about two years ago we found out that my dad had been having an affair for almost 7 years. Since then my parents fight a lot and my mum has been diagnosed with PTSD from the night she found out (there was a big thing). A few weeks ago (maybe even a month or two) my parents had this big fight (my house is small so every time they fight I can hear them). Usually, it ends with my mum walking out or her coming and sleeping in my bed with me. However, this time when my mum tried to leave my dad wouldn't let her (he usually tries to stop her). My mum was saying stuff like ""why don't you kill me."" The whole time this was happening it was like I couldn't even cry, I was just shaking uncontrollably. My dad was being manipulative and telling my mum that she couldn't tell anyone what he had done or he would call the police on her. Ever since the night we found out I have constantly been worried that my mum was going to kill herself, she has assured me that she won't but it's hard to not think about it. Anyway, ever since that night whenever one of my parents raise their voice, my dad uses the tone he reserves for arguments, a door is closed too loudly or someone is stomping on the floor (sometimes it's even people arguing on the tv that I can hear from my room) it's like my heart skips a beat until I realise that it's okay and my heart beats really fast. It also happened while writing this. I don't know if it is PTSD, sometimes I feel like maybe I am just looking for attention and reading into things too much.

Hoping with this post I can get some advice and feel like I’m not the only one who experiences this. Apologise if this is triggering for anyone or TMI. As I’ve talked about before some years ago now I was brutally raped by a stranger. I’ve had an extensive journey of healing and made some great, massive steps, but struggling today because of how I’m feeling which in turn makes me frustrated. I want to move on with my life and I want to be in control. I’m wondering if anyone on here has experienced what I’m experiencing as I can’t find much research about it, it’s been years since I was raped as I’ve said but I’m really struggling with what I think is psychosomatic physical pain, resembling the pain exactly I felt while I was being attacked. It’s something that has come and gone since my attack but it hasn’t happened in quite a few months, for some reason today it’s really bad and I’m struggling to concentrate on my work as a result. It’s making me extremely upset. I shouldn’t feel this physical pain. I’m safe, I’m alone, no one is touching me and I know that, but I can’t make this pain cease. I have strategies and things I have learnt, but as of yet none seem to be effective today. Feeling lost, tired, flat, frustrated and overwhelmed hoping someone understands what I am describing and can tell me I’m not alone in experiencing this and maybe even some tips on how to get through it, that I maybe haven’t tried or thought of.

I know the richness of trusted friends who walk beside each other, sharing their experiences and what gives them strength and hope can be the most helpful sometimes. Knowing the diagnoses etc is helpful, but living with it every day is the challenge and cannot be done alone. This environment allows for focus upon difficulties which perhaps my friends & family are somewhat jaded by after over 30 years, especially since they don't know what it's like to live with (thank goodness!).

PTSD-833,I can't afford to be alive anymore. No family to help me out. I don't know what to do or where to begin.,"Hi everyone, I hope you're all keeping safe and well during Covid and taking care of yourselves. Right now, I really need some support and Amy advice I can get. I don't know what to do or where to start. I'm in my late twenties, in NSW, and my rent is due this Monday or I'm going to be evicted I'm on a centrelink payment, with a job agency, receive rent assistance (Centrelink) and have a health care card. I've been using the local food bank because I can't afford to eat. I'm extremely lucky that my GP bulk bills and does a brilliant job with my care. I've used my once yearly Centrelink advance up, and do not qualify for an urgent payment (my next week's payment advanced toe today). I have severe depression, anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD. Recovery is a part of my daily life and I have the will to keep improving, although not always the means to afford everything I can to help facilitate it. As far as I know I'm in touch with all the local services and charities and what they have to offer. I've already been given an extension to pay my rent from my landlord which she can't and won't do again. Basically, I can't afford to be alive anymore. I usually budget very well and can live off extremely little. I'm always looking to improve myself and my situation and have been applying for different jobs with no success. My job agency has yet to find me work even though I'm a good candidate and have a very good case manager who's been helping me brilliantly. Apparently a job is coming, one that I've been told I'd be perfect for, but it's been months now and I'm at the absolute end of my financial rope. I struggle with horrible flashbacks, night terrors, nightmares. I experienced extremely prolonged and violent trauma growing up and it feels like I'm paying for it even more so now that I'm an adult. I also experienced terrible domestic violence over a year ago and spent a long time trying to escape and to get help and treatment and to rebuild my life. I knew that I would most likely face homelessness upon escaping the domestic violence, and after getting away and not being able to keep myself afloat anymore I just collapsed mentally from all of the stress and became homeless. I became socially isolated during the abuse. I made my way to a shelter and my experience there was as terrifying as the domestic violence. I have nothing left to sell for rent, and I don't think I can face homelessness again. I'm terrified, exhausted, and so sad.

PTSD-834,Can you over come PTSD,Hi I'm in relapse of PTSD and not functioning well. Any type of loud talk or noise or if someone has a scowl on their face I am going straight to panic. My heart races I get terrified and imagine terrible things are going to happen and I can't stop it. I'm always trying to keep ahead of any drama making sure everyone is happy. Hiding things and not saying how I feel and when asked a question I can't answer. I stutter and get sick in stomach i listen for sounds in the house and their voices to see if tone is ok. Are they happy is dog doing the right thing are neighbors ok are bills due is my boss happy. I'm having days where I can't move or function. But if any family say how are you I say I'm fantastic and smile. I'm working cooking cleaning but my hairs not done and I'm in pjs I'm working remotely so on good days I work longer hours to make up for my bad days and I've taken leave when I'm really bad. Bad dreams are back all my husband has to say to me is something he's not happy with and I nearly fall to the floor. He's not the cause of my PTSD but he is making trigger back to my life of terror. Is there a cure or something that can make me be able to calmly talk about disagreements instead of me saying yes yes whatever you want no problem it's good. And then hands shaking stomach sick heart racing cold sweat crying panic grab keys and ready to run while begging please stop talking I can't handle it I'm going to die it's too much.

PTSD-835,I don't know where to start- everything has been falling apart *Trigger warning- suicide*,"I am 14 years old and I have been through more than any teen ever should. It began with my awful parents, who verbally abuse me and have told me my whole life I am not good enough. They lecture me and shout at me, and today only an hour ago my dad put hands on me and hurt me and now I am a bit scared. Everything began to fall apart when I was 11 years old. My parents had told me I was not good enough, and I had had enough. I lost the will to live and at just aged 11, one day after school I made a suicide attempt. I didn't go through with it as you can tell, and I have regretted it every moment since. But it cannot be undone, and the ramifications are ongoing, ranging from anxiety and panic attacks to depression to confidence issues to trust issues and even to the feeling of numbness and emptiness I feel every day when I get home or when I have even a moment to think. And I don't know what to do. I saw a counsellor and I made her cry with all the issues and crap I was going through, and yet my parents don't care. They think mental health only exists for depressed teenage girls who struggle with social media, and that suicide is selfish and lazy and wrong because it hurts the person's friends and family, not once thinking about the person. I never outright told the counsellor about the suicide, but she kind of knew, and so said to me that sometimes last resorts can become our last resorts multiple times in our lifetimes, and she said there is a chance that I made resort to my last resort again since the conditions and causes have remained constant and only worsened. I don't think I am strong enough to deal with another suicide attempt alone (since I haven't told anyone or gotten help in 3 years), so if there is a second there may possibly be a third, and I am worried that might not just be an attempt. However, at this moment, I would never commit suicide, and I am holding out for my 18th when I can leave and never speak to them again. I know none of you can physically help me, or even come in here and stop my dad from all the verbal and increasing physical abuse, and that's ok because I have learnt to fend for myself, but it would be nice to know someone else out there cares and that there are good people in the world. Please reply to this with kind words, because those are increasingly scarce in my life, and I need someone to help me feel good about myself and about life again.",Beth14,Community Member,29-10-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-don-t-know-where-to-start-everything-has-been-falling-apart/td-p/508137
PTSD-836,I was sexually assaulted by my friend,"Hi, I’m new here & don’t really know what to say. But I’m feeling so lost right now. 2 months ago I was sexually assaulted by a friend. We were out and he offered me a place on his couch to crash. When we got there he started hitting on me and wouldn’t take no for an answer. He told me “I was asking for it” by coming there, and that “it didn’t matter if things were weird, it’d be awkward after anyways so it might as well happen”. He kept touching me and he had me pinned to the couch. I always thought that I was the type of girl who’d be strong enough to get out of that situation. Or that I would never be in that situation in the first place. But there he was touching me, and I was frozen. He didn’t rape me, but there was a point where I thought he was going to. I couldn’t say anything, or move, let alone push him off. Since then I’ve been a wreck. I’m too scared to tell my parents. Some of my friends know, but they don’t fully understand. And to make it worse we play the same sport so I have to see him every week. Every week I get worked up about seeing him, and it’s so hard. But if I don’t go, and do the thing I love, he wins. So instead I’ve been suffering in silence. This past week it’s really gotten to me and I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can't concentrate on uni, I’ve stopped hanging out with my friends. He’s controlling me still and I hate that. I hate that he makes me feel weak and powerless. I hate that he makes me feel as if it was my fault, even though I tell myself it isn’t. I don’t know what to do next, but I know I can’t keep going on like this.

PTSD-837,CPTSD from Family of Origin/Enmeshment,"Hi all, I'm struggling a lot from a recent realisation that spun a lot of my internal thoughts on their head, I used to think more along the lines of having to deal with how I was responding to a dysfunctional family environment; having to be the one that stepped in between family disagreements/fights/yelling matches. This alone has left me in a lot of ways feeling like I am a failure for not being able to keep the family together. My therapist introduced me to the term of enmeshment, which started to unravel a series of thoughts because some of the ongoing symptoms of being raised in an enmeshed family described me perfectly. The void that seemed to grow from that recently is; that having to be there for my parents as a 'voice of reason' has left me with years of not being 'seen' or 'heard' by my parents (reaching into up until recently, some 20 years at least) as someone that was suffering from the fall-on affects of them being both too proud to admit there were difficulties which left me with nobody to talk to about how hard it was for me (because in order to come to my level they would have to admit they were doing something wrong). This has hit me for a six, and I'm feeling a bit emotionally overwhelmed. Has anyone else had any experiences like this growing up? I'm trying to listen to resources around it, but they are making me feel more and more raw.

PTSD-839,C-PTSD/developmental immaturity... Living in fear. (¿Trigger warning?),"I’ve been scoping out this forum for awhile now, I’ve been afraid of posting... until now I guess, okay then. Recently I was diagnosed with c-PTSD due to living with child/adulthood trauma. I am 25 yrs old and, well, I don’t remember a day in my entire existence when I wasn’t being subjected to trauma or abuse. If the abuse wasn’t being dished out by another, then it was me abusing me, after all I could only take so much until I had to stop and think, if in fact there was something internally wrong with me that was the reason why these horrible things kept on happening to me. I was bullied from the day I walked into primary until the day I left high school in year 11. I was verbally abused, physically harassed, humiliated and neglected at every turn by the people (i.e. teachers and parents) who were meant to protect me from such acts of cruelty. The teachers I blame the most, my parents, well they are certainly at fault in many ways, but there came a time where my trust in adults evaporated, and as a result I kept a lot to myself... I can can go on and on about my childhood with the bullying, the neglect and my battle with mental illness which between the ages 18 & 20 I spent more time in mental health institutions then out — s-harm/s-attempts/dissociation etc.— same as recently tbh, but none of that compares to the last 5 years. At 20 yrs of age I got on NDIS, shortly after my last hospital admission my family had very little hope left, so their last attempt was to put me on NDIS. Thus began the 5 worse years of my life... I was soon paired with a DSW who became my full-time “carer”... well that was a joke, because in those 5 years he raped me/physically and psychologically abused me/threatened me/manipulated me into being his slave by working intensively for 90hrs a week without a dime, only with the promise of not facing his wrath if I do... not that he kept that promise anyway. He put my life in danger (erratic driving/taking me to his drug dealer/other)/he leveraged my already addictive persona by getting me on the drugs & alcohol (“drink with me or you’ll regret it”) controlled my finances putting me in dept after my escape and worse of all making me bare witness to his abuse of others (“tell anyone and you’ll regret it”)... gaslighting — made me believe I was Bisexual to justify him raping me (“I see you’re confused, if you want you can experiment with me, let me help you” etc.) I’m scared and I don’t know how to cope with any of this.",TB-L1995,Community Member,20-10-2020,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/c-ptsd-developmental-immaturity-living-in-fear-trigger-warning/td-p/533149

So Here's why: Until a few months I was renting a house off her, to everyone she knew, she made sure she told them that I was a 'loser' and that she bought a house for me to rent and if it wasn't for her kindness and generosity I would've still been homeless or dead. During the time I was there she tried to evict me once, because she thought I was going to end my relationship with my partner and when we started working things out, she sent out a notice, she rescinded after certain 'conditions' were met. Me and partner were in trouble relationship wise and she knew this, about 6 months later me and my partner reached breaking point. She then sent an eviction notice to my partner and told me she wasn't happy with how things were and that she wasn't evicting me just him and that if we chose to stay together then we could but not while living under the same roof. I told her that if he goes I go, this time she refused to rescind the notice but allowed him to stay, once again providing 'certain conditions' were met, the main one being we had to go from an open relationship to a monogamous one, because their wrong. For the rest of the time we were there she would remind my partner if he ever disagreed with her that she hadn't rescinded the notice or she didn't have to renew the lease, she did that out of kindness. When we left nothing was right or good enough, despite at the final inspection she said it was good enough, but then she changed her mind every call there was something else, more money, I gave in and handed over the bond, so I could end the nightmare. She is image and cleanliness obsessed no matter how clean we kept the house everytime she visited I could feel her eyes examining everything trying to find a speck of dirt so she could let me know, I also believe she regularly went through the house while we were renting. If I don't wear makeup up when I go out with her she tells me off that I could have at least made an effort and that others will probably think I'm a slob and I need a little pride, too much though and I'll look like a stuck up tart. This is just the tip of how deep things go there is so much more.",no_one1,Community Member,20-10-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/daughter-of-a-narcisstic-mother/td-p/533125
PTSD-842,Remembering childhood abuse.,"Me again Has anyone had very little to no memory of their childhood abuse/ trauma but had memories come back after treatment? I only have memory of one pretty mild event, my sister told me she saw an event happen to me (also quite mild) but I remember a friend of mine was staying with me and asked me if the abuser did a certain thing, and I remember having this sick feeling in my stomach and told her yes but now I don’t remember any of it, nothing. I get a very sick feeling in my stomach if anyone touches me on certain parts of my body and I do not let anyone use certain methods when it comes to sex because I can’t handle the sick and anxious feelings that come with it and I’m wondering if that has anything to do with something happening to me or if it’s just a feeling I get. I know he did stuff to me which was enough to take him to court (I was about 12) and if he pleaded guilty to all of his charges he would have gone to jail but he said he would plead guilty to half if I dropped the rest so I settled for that. Now almost 20 years later I don’t remember what any of the other events that I had him charged over were and it makes me feel so crazy and question if anything else even happened?! Like surely I would have at least some memory of it? I’ve had flashbacks of other sexual trauma I’ve experienced in my teens and 20s but nothing more of him. Just flashes of his face and him playing games with us like chasey outside (we’re currently staying with my mum and she still lives in the house the abuse happened) so I have had flashbacks of him being at the house but no more of the abuse by him.",Anzee,Community Member,18-10-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/remembering-childhood-abuse/td-p/531764
PTSD-843,How can you be comfortably intimate after new triggers arise from childhood abuse?,"Hi everyone, I’ve posted on here a few times for different reasons but they all pretty much relate back to the fact I experienced sexual abuse as a child. I have been with my partner for almost 10 years, we have two kids together and we’ve always had a regular and strong sex life. But in April I went through a traumatic event where I was unexpectedly hospitalised with a heart condition and wasn’t allowed to see my family due to covid, I was in ICU and then transferred to a Melbourne hospital. Luckily the procedure was straight forward and although traumatic as I was kept awake and painful it was fixed within a couple of hours. I had severe health anxiety for months afterwards and seeked help from a psychologist. A few months after seeing her I had a trigger surrounding my childhood abuse and I told the psychologist, she referred me to CASA (centre against sexual assault) but it’s taken me a couple of months to actually get the courage to go through with it and I am currently on a wait list. although once I had my first trigger, intimacy was different and my partner had to accept that we couldn’t do the same things we used to, I could still continue for him and not be too uncomfortable, but the last few weeks I am struggling to be intimate at all, every time we try I have triggers and panic attacks and I was just letting him finish anyways to make at least one of us satisfied but the longer I’m waiting to talk to CASA the harder it is getting to even do that and although my partner is trying to be supportive, he doesn’t understand how we can have a strong sex life for 9+ years to nothing so he does get really frustrated and grumpy toward me and the kids when I can’t go through with it for him. I have tried to tell myself I am safe and he is not going to hurt me but I just get so shaky and anxious and end up having flashbacks or nightmares which is really affecting my coping level. Has anyone found something that works to stop having these triggers every time you even try to be intimate? I can’t help but feel like our relationship is wearing thin because of the lack of intimacy.",Anzee,Community Member,10-10-2020,PTSD and trauma,13,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-can-you-be-comfortably-intimate-after-new-triggers-arise/td-p/526876
PTSD-844,Missing my children,"Its been 7.5 years....long, long, traumatic years without my children. My ex husband and my old friend...his partner one day didn't return them. By the time I had spent and sold everything I owned to try and see them...yes, apparently they may do this...police were no help...just inflamed the situation....by that time it ws many many months and my once loving little angels were 'terrified' and scared of me and didn't want to know me. It's alienation...i am reconciled with that and don't blame them for rejecting me...but it doesn't stop my sadness and devastation of it all. I get flashbacks daily of all sorts of things....despite me being a nice person and law abiding...i have been arrested twice (Seriously...you wouldn't believe it could happen based on no evidence of anything, just phone calls made by my old 'friend')...I have lost any money I had...furniture , everything sold, nearly lived in my car with my dogs twice over 5 moves in 2 years...I had to keep downsizing to more affordable places...I didn't have very many options...my self esteem is shot...I'm trying to do uni at my older age and my 20 year old self (that failed uni) is screaming loser constantly....so 2 essays are due and I have to deal with the actual process as well as calming my inner guard that wants to protect me from more failure...in my job I often have people that get upset...that happened this morning...I did a favour and said I wouold train someone...I didn't want to..and I ask for too little money...anyway...she got upset over a family thing...so I gave her coffee and a chat and then she wanted to train after...so I have given up my morning when I desperately need to get my uni work done now....and I am emotionally spent comforting her...I am being selfish now...shes a lovely person , but she has her daughters...i don't...

PTSD-845,Probably the most pathetic person you will ever read about.,"Hey, I hope everyone is doing well. I'm a 27 year old ""man"" and I've never had a job, never lived on my own, never had a girlfriend or so much as held hands with anyone in my life. As you can see, the title was not hyperbole. My parents split up when I was around 7 or 8, Dad moved away and I haven't seen him much since then. Around 2 years later Mum got a boyfriend, he seemed nice but he was also an angry drunk. Around the time I started High School it got a lot worse. He'd be drinking before I even left for school in the morning, and by the time I got home he was always in a really bad mood. He started getting violent with us and I was always scared, it was like walking on egg shells for years trying not to set him off. I can remember him yelling and physically abusing us, then 15 minutes later he would be crying, saying he loved us and he'd ""never hurt us"". I started waking up most nights to loud arguments, sometimes I had panic attacks listening to him. We called the police several times but there was never much they could do. Over this time I put on a lot of weight, people bullied me at school for being fat and ugly and I didn't really have friends. I used to love school and I wanted to do well, but my grades went downhill. By the end I never wanted to go and I was always so tired, I barely even passed. Shortly after I finished school, Mum's boyfriend physically assaulted me. This was the final straw and he finally left us, but we didn't have the money to get my teeth fixed. I was so embarrassed and ashamed I stopped looking after myself completely, I just wanted to hide away and never be seen again. ... And that's basically what I did. It's almost 10 years later and like a useless child I still let Mum support me. I've been trying to apply to jobs for years and I just can't, I basically have a breakdown just trying to figure out what to put on my blank resume, I have tears in my eyes just thinking about it. I know how pathetic it sounds but I can't explain it, anxiety just cripples me. I lost weight but I actually feel worse about how I look now, I'm so ugly and scrawny. I'm too scared to even ask for help, I have a lump in my throat just posting here. Worst of all is knowing I've wasted what should've been the best time of my life, the regret is so painful. I don't know what to do. I just want to be normal.",mogwai129,Community Member,10-10-2020,PTSD and trauma,18,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/probably-the-most-pathetic-person-you-will-ever-read-about/td-p/527411
PTSD-846,First time poster & abuse survivor.,"My younger sister has always been the bossy one and the one aware of her mental health and proactive in doing something to take care of herself. Her latest is telling me I have PTSD and demanding that I see a doctor and get help. I'd never really thought about this before but doing some research I have found myself here. I was physically, mentally and sexually abused for 14 years of my childhood. My home life was not great, my ""safe"" person (my Grandma) passed away when I was 16 and I was offered no grief counselling and to this day I struggle to attend funerals and grieve for friends and family. I was an alcoholic but have been sober for 20 plus years. I cry a lot, I have anxiety (not formally diagnosed), I have the most bizarre and vivid dreams most nights which cause lack of sleep, I have a couple of triggers that really upset me, I like to be in control of things, I hate asking for help from anyone and will struggle on and do things for myself, I prefer to stay at home and avoid as many social things that I can, I push people away, I only have a few close friends. A big issue for me is that I comfort eat, which was fine when I was younger and could burn it off easily but now I'm overweight. Part of me hates how big I am and part of me likes it as it's a big ""up you"" to my mother who constantly told me I was fat and had to lose weight when I was a child/teen. I've spoken to a counselor in the past but all I really did was sit and cry for the entire session as I struggled to articulate how I was feeling. I feel like maybe I do have PTSD but it's not something I know much about and wonder how to bring this up with my gp. It's nice to have read some other people's posts and know that I am not alone. Not sure what I'm really looking for here, maybe just validation that this is something I can see my doctor about and not just something I'm making up in my head.

PTSD-848,Is This Workplace Bullying?,"Hi All, I feel like I can't think straight about the current situation I am in, so wanted to get some inbiased opinions or event hear about similar situations regarding workplace bullying. I work for a small company. My boss has a difficult character. His friends have asked me how I can stand working for him, he has had complaints against him from other companies in our coworking space, and is often rude and difficult to deal with. He has every sign of narcissistic personality disorder, inclluding treating people like objects, lacking empathy, having a gradiose opinion of himself and so on. HOWEVER, I am conscious this doesn't mean I have a case for workplace bullying based on his character alone. When I joined this business I was his first employee and there were no processes in place. It was chaos, to the point where he even missed out on paying me once because he had no system in place to track this. He hired a friend of over 20 years who has a background in communication and business processes. He also hired a personal friend of his to be a consultant (I am also a consultant) and a payroll manager. Fastforward to a couple of years later and a business that had no processes has multiple processes rolled out every month. They are difficult to keep track of and even though a lot of training and documentation occurs for the sake of these processes, they often change and are very hard to navigate through. We had an incident earlier this year where he was angry at me for forgetting to do several of these processes, raised his voice at me in front of other staff and other companies, and then proceeded to gossip about me openly in front of my colleague. I told him I had an appointment and was leaving for the day but would see him tomorrow. He blocked my access to emails and clients and said he thought I had resigned, though I never said I resigned in any way. The next day he was still angry, borderline explosive, and I told him I wouldn't discuss any issues without a witness present. He yelled at me until he was read in the face about how angry I make him and how little he trusts me. I finally had to say ""I feel bullied"" to get him to give me personal space and stop yelling.",Freya20,Community Member,09-10-2020,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/is-this-workplace-bullying/td-p/526582
PTSD-849,My friend Frank - this is what I call shame (Trigger warning: Sexual Abuse),"Franks is a funny kind of name to me, and I'm sorry to those of you who are indeed named Frank, or have significant people in your lives named Frank - I really don't wish to cause offense or upset. Some years ago I started referring to shame in my life as Frank. I've known shame for many, many years and at times it has almost crippled me. It's been important for me to learn to distinguish in a number of ways. Firstly, shame is not mine, it was given to me (or more appropriately forced upon me) by others. And secondly, feeling ashamed is very different from feeling or being shamed. Feeling ashamed results from having done something wrong or hurtful, whereas being shamed (and the feelings that go with such) are most often the result of someone else's words or treatment toward you that conveys a message of insufficiency or of not being enough. And so, Frank and I go way back, in fact, I've known Frank for most of my life. That's when it all began. He came in to my life when I was around 3 or 4 in the throes of sexual abuse. I was shamed by two adult men who were sexually abusing me, and mocking me. This introduction to Frank is one of my earliest memories, and I can still the images so very clearly. Frank has been in my life ever since and has prevented me from doing some of the things that I would have liked to have done and from fully living as freely as I would prefer to. Over the years, I've learnt to tune out Frank's words, or shut him up, but sometimes he is still really loud. Growing up i the late 70s and 80s, I learnt that there were ways to be a man, and the more of a man you were, the better. So, along with sexual prowess and winning the ladies, sporting proficiency, an interest in cars, masculine bravado and machismo, one also had to be well endowed in the underpants department. I was none of those things, quite opposite to those, I was gentle, tactile, artistic, expressive, loathed sports, and not all all well endowed where it seemed to matter most. And I was (am) gay to make it worse. If their was a caste in high school, I was an untouchable. And just in case I wasn't sure of where I stood in the order of things, I got my head flushed in the toilet regularly enough to help me remember. Frank is an old aged man now and is growing frail, but he's still around. Sometimes I have conversations with Frank and other times I'm like ""Yeah, I can hear you Frank, but can you shut up?"" Do you get me?",Tom R,Blue Voices Member,09-10-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-friend-frank-this-is-what-i-call-shame-trigger-warning-sexual/td-p/526530

PTSD-851,Hi New person with a different story,"Hello My name is Michael and I am 56 and came on to this forum to partly get my story out and also to get some pointers. I do not have a formal diagnosis yet but I want to get one. I lived and worked in the Middle East for many years and got laid off over there in 2016. I started a business over there so that my son could finish school where he was but the business did not work and one thing led to another and I ended up in Jail over there in a very small room with 12 other guys because i owed money. I ended up starting to get flashbacks because I blocked things out of my mind and I also ended up developing acute symptoms of claustrophobia and was crying a lot.. Ended up in hospital in the prison system being treated by a Psychiatrist while there. I was released from prison and had to settle legal matters before we could return to Australia which we did in January I found a job and worked for a company for a while but unfortunately I was not at my best I felt exhausted and a combination of that and the company problems with Covid meant that I did not survive there. I have been on job seeker and earning as much income as I can dipped into my super etc to survive. I have a wife and son dependent on me and try as I might I cannot persuade them to go to centrelink to register. They are angry with me and at one level I cant blame them I am a HR practitioner and trainer talking to people about work every day but not got anything permanent over the line yet. I still get flashbacks of both the prison experience and the lead up to it, It is a year on September 22 since the prison experience happened. The marriage is over and its best that we live apart. Just need to find the means to acheive that . I have been getting flashbacks, depression i feel like I am in a fog as well as some anxiety I need to deal with this for my own sake and my families sake.

The last few weeks I have been seeing pictures in my head, but not in a way that I see the event from start to finish. It is just like a flick of an event, then there is another flick of a different one. More like flicking through a photo album than watching a movie, I guess. Sometimes what I see is a couple of seconds, but it’s usually just a moment in time. It does help if I can describe the picture to our doc. I have told him about a couple of them. Not the actual bad stuff, I can’t remember a lot of the details. Things like talking about the room in detail, or the ground I am sitting on - that sort of stuff. And if I do that, that snapshot fades - but it’s replaced by another one. I probably should say we were diagnosed with DID quite a few years ago and I’m not the original, the one born into the body. And unfortunately my fear at what I see ‘bleeds’ through to some others in our system and they feel the fear but don’t always know why. That makes me feel so guilty.

I knew back at the time he was getting some grief but I was busy skipping school etc and stupidly put it down to just the usual high school issues I thought every kid faced and didn’t really think much of it. I have very recently learnt due to him telling me briefly the extent of the bullying being both very physical and emotional with regular beatings and emotional bullying all due to things that were made up about him from another student. As a result I am now seeing him struggle with depression, anxiety, and what seems to be in my unprofesssional opinion ptsd like symptoms. He now doesn’t like to be very social, has trouble trusting many people and is quite withdrawn from most things. He also doesn’t look after his health overly well. I took time to do some research and it led me to lost here for some help. How can I help him in any way to encourage him to get back to his former self or to get a positive outlook on life again. I don’t want to come on too strongly and cause him to shy away from the issues or not want to confide in me which may cause more issues being that I’m one of very few that he can talk to. I’ve always had very strong mental health so it’s hard for me to put myself in his shoes to be able to help in some way. Any advice would be super. thanks in advance",MT92,Community Member,21-09-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/bullying-in-high-school-shaping-adult-life/td-p/514922

PTSD-862,"Hello everyone. First post, seeking support for sexual harassment and PTSD.","Hey, everyone. I hope you're all doing well in your own journeys. I am very thankful to anyone who takes the time to connect with me here, and offer some comfort. I'm here because my PTSD has been triggered by recent sexual harassment. I'm a young man, and a middle-aged woman made sexual comments towards me in a digital setting. (She is probably 20 years older than me.) She was very judgemental when I expressed discomfort, and ultimately deleted her on social media. I have taken practical steps to separate from her, and have informed a relevant community organiser, who will be speaking with her about boundaries, etc. Practical safety aside, I'm feeling hollow inside, and scared. This is bringing up some negative stuff. When I was in year 8, an older girl emotionally manipulated me, and sexually harassed me into having a relationship with her. She performed sex acts in front of me, with her older boyfriend. When I was in year 10, two adult women sexually harassed myself and a friend, and instructed us to kiss in the backseat of a car, telling me afterwards not to inform my mum about what happened. It made me feel dirty and shameful, as though I had done something wrong, when I was simply the victim of adult inappropriateness. Those feelings are returning now, even though I logically know I am not at fault. My childhood experiences conditioned me to think ""how could I have avoided this"" and ""how am I responsible for what happened"", and even though I deliberately try to resist these nonsense impulses, they still creep up on me. I am happy about one thing. I told this woman that I was uncomfortable, I sought accountability, and I removed myself from the situation. So, this is a victory. Because in the past, I didn't resist. I was too afraid to stand up for myself. I would be unable to sleep, sick with terror, stomach in knots. Throughout all these experiences, I was never attracted to women (I am a gay man), so that made their perverted sexual advances even more frightening. At a young age, I knew I only liked boys, but I tried to convince myself I liked girls just to appease female predators. I think this is a fresh start. I will never allow another woman's inappropriateness to go unaddressed. I feel empowered, but I also feel disgusted. I feel angry. I want women to stop doing this to me, to just leave me alone. I want justice for the sexual harassment that occurred when I was young, but I don't know if I'll ever get it. Thank you for reading.",brian23,Community Member,14-09-2020,PTSD and trauma,9,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/hello-everyone-first-post-seeking-support-for-sexual-harassment/td-p/511647
PTSD-863,Will I Ever Overcome This Depression?,"Where to begin, this is my first time posting on this online forum and I find it difficult to even write down my feelings as I feel that for the first time in a long time I am acknowledging them. Living with trauma depression, accompanied by social anxiety is extremely difficulty. I find myself constantly worried about what everyone is thinking with the never ending question ""Where will I end up in my life?"" From a young age, I was abused by my father both mentally and physically while spending each night praying and asking for my mum to leave him. At the age of 12, everything came crashing down when the police came and took my father away as my mum finally got the courage to go into the police station with myself and younger brother. From then my depression spiraled out of control as I was 12 years old, never going to school, self-harming and eventually landing myself in hospital for my second suicide attempt at the age of 14. From there I spent time in hospital in a children's ward for my own safety, although I eventually came out of it by choosing to leave school and complete my year 10 at TAFE. Although I did not have a formal education, I continued to pursue my dreams of becoming an educator, completing my Certificate III, Diploma and finally obtaining my Bachelor of Early Childhood Education and Care. After working, last week I left my job due to the work culture as I felt I was not supported and their was constant bitching about fellow staff members. With this, my depression and trauma resurfaced, while thinking to myself ""Is this workplace culture good for my own mental health?"" In reality, I knew it was not as both my mind, body and heart knew, and I immediately left without giving my 2 weeks notice which I feel horrible about. Before making this decision I did speak about how I was feeling, as well as explaining my current feelings of depression, thinking to myself ""Maybe they can provide assistance or additional support?"" With that question being asked, I then knew I was completely wrong based on the response. As I am sitting here now I find myself myself thinking ""Will my depression be a constant struggle?"" and ""Maybe I wont get anywhere in life?""",HealingTheSoul,Community Member,21-09-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/will-i-ever-overcome-this-depression/td-p/515154
PTSD-864,Broken and tired,"Hello I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and BPD, stemming from childhood abuse and neglect as well as being sexually assaulted twice by a ""friend"" as a young teen. I have a serious problem with coming back to reality when i get in, what i like to call fight or flight. I generally end up having a massive anxiety attack or sometimes, if I cant get control of that. Ill harm myself. Throughout my early 20's, at night clubs particularly, if a random guy would even just stare at me too long, I would without fail, become aggressive. I would instantly become fearful and thats when the fight or flight would come in, how ever, when it comes to men, its generally fight. The most frustrating part about all of this is i KNOW and can FEEL an episode arising and I KNOW that kind of behaviour is completely wrong, but back then, I couldnt control myself. I wanted these men to stop and leave me alone and just lacked the patience completely if they didnt listen straight away. I would just lose it, a handful of times I have turned around and used violence towards a guy for being grabby toward me, or if a guy sat down next to me i asked him to please move away, if he didnt listen that instant, the anger would just completely take over me. I did this for years. even today, i find myself grasping some what of control as I am a mum now of a three year old and i dont want to be this angry person anymore, But unfortunately recently and over the past few years I have been hurting myself through self harm, binge eating, bulemia, over exercising. I dont have parents.. sorry.. I do have parents but I havent spoken to neither of them since i was 33 weeks pregnant, because that was the day my mother assaulted me at my baby shower. She also assaulted my friends and other family members who were trying to protect my unborn child. My relationship with my parents was broken from a young age, but was destroyed when I asked for their support when I'd been raped. According to them I was a slut and probably drank too much.. I was 16 years old. I carry a lot of anger and resentment and even writing this has made me so angry. I am still on the waiting list to see a therapist but I just thought id try here.. maybe itll help. thank you so much for reading.",falldown7timesstandup8,Community Member,16-09-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/broken-and-tired/td-p/512250
PTSD-865,Venting,"Hello, I have a diagnosis of PTSD and I have been partaking in emdr for almost 18 months which has been incredibly helpful.

My hands were so shaky that i split bpiling hot tea down my front and created a right old scene 🤦‍.Two days later I feel irritable, withdrawn, confusedand I have had two nights of unpleasant dreams.

PTSD-866,How do I tell the psychiatrist? Help!,"Hi All, I’ve had about 3 appointments in person & 1 video call & 1 phone call during the initial Covid peak with a psychiatrist. Now the psychiatrist is male, which makes me quite uncomfortable to discuss certain things. He knows there was sexual abuse when I was a child but I can’t tell him the full story. As the childhood incidents were with a male medical professional for a completely unrelated medical condition, I just feel like if I talk about it with a male I am planting the idea in other people’s head to do the same. And I’m already triggered before even going into each session because I literally relive the trauma every time I sit in a waiting room & I feel & experience all the things I felt as a terrified little girl sitting in the waiting room to see the evil doctor. On top of that, I feel extreme shame about the whole thing & I worry my feelings are an overreaction & people will think I am stupid for feeling the way I do. my psychologist is female & while it was difficult, I have been able to discuss with her all that happened. Last session with her I told how the psychiatrist was really confused because he didn’t have the whole story. The psychologist asked if I wanted her to write to him about the situation. I said yes & felt great relief, but asked that she did not copy in my entire medical team (like she has with her previous updates). Honestly, my endocrinologist & diabetes educator do not need to know this stuff. Then she got hesitant saying she could write just to him but couldn’t guarantee he wouldn’t share the information with my medical team. i can’t bring myself to tell him in person, so she suggested writing it down on a piece of paper, having him read it & then ask for the paper back. But honestly this terrifies me even more. Just thinking about sitting there in uncomfortable silence while he reads my letter sounds like the most excruciating, shameful & uncomfortable experience. I am burning with shame just thinking about it. How do I bring up the courage to either tell him or write it down for him? I am terrified. Appointment is a week away but I’m freaked about it already.",TheBigBlue,Community Member,08-09-2020,PTSD and trauma,11,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-do-i-tell-the-psychiatrist-help/td-p/507679

I wanted to deal with losing my children...but thats fine and good..it's all interconnected.... I'm just unsure whether I can stomach going to someone who won't connect with me...I tried small talk afterward and she just said it sounds like you are trying to get my approval...fair call...I was trying to relate...I don't know...is this normal...I just felt disapproved of...or judged. Probably my paranoia I'm sure... I just felt nothing except a stone wall ... I just wonder where she is going and whether I can cope with that stony face again, there was no real goodbye, have a nice day...just nothing.

PTSD-868,My Story/Introduction,"Hi, i'm agender, 21 just have to say whoever reads this some stuff that i've written is disturbing. I was born as a boy. i was raised pretty much by my father for the first 10 years of my life as my mother was a cop 24/7 then studyed for a few years at night school to be a teacher, my relationship with her from age 10 til now isn't good and has been deteriorating more each year. Growing up with my dad around was horrible he did drugs, smoked/drank heavily, was always out at parties leaving me alone at home plus i was physically abused by him from age 6 to 15 for reasons that i still have no idea why even today which as a result left me with PTSD. I was diagnosed with mild Autism at the age of 3 from then til age 15 i had a countless number of speech therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists etc. School whether if it was primary or high was very traumatic had hardly any friends (only 1) i was bullied heavily and physically abused by teachers and students. From age 10 til now my life's been a misery i did drugs from age 10 to 21. I was an alcoholic for a while, i decided at one point that i had to go to rehab which did wonders and i've been off drugs and alcohol since then. But after wrecking my brain with the drugs and alcohol over that long period of time i've noticed that i hulicinate, can't walk properly (straight) and that i always make quiet random noises and talk to myself without thinking it. I'm also suicidal my last attempt was last month as a result i lost my relationship with my second family as soon as i told them, i always call helplines when i feel suicidal. Just to finish it off i've now got no friends and don't talk to my family at all, whoever reads this and can relate to this just know that you're not alone.",Agenderandproudofit,Community Member,13-08-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-story-introduction/td-p/518540
PTSD-869,Not coping today,"Been triggered all day today. Couldn't relax. Started panicking. Felt so abused and so powerless. This trigger happened and it continued to cause me stress all day. I'm still trying to relax. I got angry with the trigger, I had verbal outbursts, I got scared and I felt alone and powerless and defeated and it ruined my whole day. I feel like I've been thrown around all day. I have a mental health plan I got from my doctor but I never followed up with it because this other counsellor rang me but she is a womens health counsellor and I really need to see the psychologist on the plan who can help me with this. This is not something I can cope with. When I'm not triggered, I'm fine. But the trigger is something unavoidable at the moment so I'm having really bad reactions to it. I definitely want to see the psychologist now as its gotten to that stage. I will put on a nice movie to take my mind off this horrible day I have had all day. I just want to cry and I am not one to cry easily anymore, even when I need to. I was so stressed from this horrible trigger all day that I couldn't sit just distract myself with something else as it was impossible to concentrate on anything else. The trigger reaction was so huge. I am hanging in there to see this psychologist. And if I keep having this trigger reaction I probably need some medication to calm me down to feel safe again. I don't feel safe when I am triggered. I get really scared. Its awful.",Universling,Community Member,06-09-2020,PTSD and trauma,14,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/not-coping-today/td-p/506901
PTSD-870,Acknowledging trauma & trying to find community support (Trigger Warning: Emotional Abuse & Anxiety),"Hi everyone, It feels like it's been ages since the last time I posted anything on the forum. I still find myself fall into a hole of constant fear, guilt, and anxiety. I've left a shared flat where I had a very hard time with an emotionally abusive friend/housemate. I still find it hard to refer to them as an abusive person. I can't wrap my head around it. I even feel bad when referring to them as emotionally abusive whenever I talk to my doctor or my counselor about them, trying to rationalize what they did because I equally made mistakes back then too. It makes it hard for me to find peace in myself. I've recently had a really bad anxiety attack that led to days of me being on edge, physically in pain, and under high stress. It was triggered by something that I've watched that really reminded me of that person. I remembered crying to the point that I had a hard time breathing, my whole body numb, and I was unable to sleep because my muscle was all tense. I genuinely thought I've finally able to move on from that traumatic point of my life yet I still doubt myself. I still feel this way, hurt, and afraid. Most of all, guilty. I feel guilty thinking of all the mistakes I did. Maybe I could've done things better. I don't know. Even when I think about the things they've done to me (gaslighting me, putting me down, twisting my words), I still think back to moments of kindness that they've done to me. I feel conflicted and fear of facing other people too. I don't know where to find community support for this kind of stuff. I'd like to find healthier ways to cope through, find people to talk to who can relate to my situation. Thank you for reading my post this far. I'd love to hear any suggestions or any replies really.

PTSD-872,"Help with partner, PRSD and depression cycles","Hi there, First time poster, long time reader. My partner suffers from PTSD, depression and anxiety. It comes in a cycles mildly monthly, but heavily 3 months and 6 months. Complete shut down, sadness and wanting to be alone. At first I was defensive and tried to keep her etc, but I have learned that patience is key and that little contact during these times snaps her out of it. The problem is she then has another bout of anxiety thinking I will leave her or not put up with it etc. She was seeing a psych, but only about other issues not this. We feel the monthly one is PMSD related as she no longer has periods due to an operation after having kids, we feel she still has the symptoms of period. The cycle is predictable but never welcoming, I too suffer from anxiety and occasional depression so I try and be strong during this time. We now live together and it's been great until 'the cycle' comes. Withdrawn, sad, pushes everyone away especially me, loss of direction, shuts down as a parent. Its heartbreaking to witness. We agreed some space will help, so she has gone for a few days and we have kept contact minimal. Its what worked last time. Its almost a bipolar personality, she completely changes.

PTSD-873,Narcissistic family,"My mother has a destructive personality disorder. I had to spend my whole life protecting myself (estranging myself) from her controlling, manipulative, abuse.

This is my story; I have got kicked out of my mums home and right after I left, her friends came and assaulted my boyfriend. He was picking me up to go home. It was so traumatic. It was also at night time so we couldn’t see clearly who it was. I felt like I was going to die that night. Luckily a car came and they ran off. The person stopped and just asked if we were okay then drove off. Me and my boyfriend were trying to find a place to hide to give time for the police or ambulance to come but they took so long. We had to Uber to the police and ambulance. I have moved 4 times ever since I left my mums house. She was verbally abusive to me. Saying things like “I wished I didn’t give birth to you” “you’re the worst daughter I’ve ever had”. She was also physically abusive. My mums boyfriends friend tried to kiss me and my mum found out but I got in trouble for it. She was violent and yelled at me. Then she let him come over again after a month only. her boyfriend used to call me abusive names all the time and she wouldn’t say anything to help me. my mum tried to force me to quit my own job and would often threaten me if I don’t “behave” she would stop letting me go to school and work completely. I’m in year 11 doing VCE. My grandparents, uncles or aunties wouldn’t help me stay with them. I ended up staying with my boyfriend’s family friend. my uncle recently called me a brat and said “what is wrong with you?” When all I did was send food as a gift to my mums house. I hate feeling that I was the cause of everything and that I still miss home. I want it to stop. I feel so unheard. I told a friend about my life story and she kept on saying “don’t be like that” “don’t be sad” “I want the happy (name) back” “tbh I think you need to suck it up” “you don’t need a psychologist, you have your friends. They’re a waste of money” “stop being like that”. She said that to me when I had the courage to speak with my voice through a call without crying for the first time. Eventually I did cry afterwards. Everytime I think about my mum or talk about her I would shake. I try explaining and talk to my boyfriend but when I do, he oversees it and just says “what do you mean” or “tell me what’s wrong”.

PTSD-878,Recent unresolved trauma from childhood content warning - servere bullying in primary school,"Hi, I'm new to this so I'm not sure how much to say I have dealt with more life than I can begin to process in 28 years, ranging from childhood trauma, medical trauma, and just life trauma in general. I have dealt with some of these traumas depending on my current situation and what I have needed to get through life. Lately, I've been going down a path of self-development and feeling like I am ready to embrace this journey and feeling like it's the right time. I had forgotten about the trauma for quite a long time (many years) until only recently. I can remember transferring to a new school at the end-of-year one, and in year 2 I was friends with everyone. I can remember a McDonald's birthday party and even the popular girls were there, but in year 3 I developed bites or something on my body all up my legs and arms. I don't know how they happened, I just remember hearing in the background that I would get them at my Father's place on visits because the house wasn't very clean, maybe bed bug bites or something? I can remember they use to be so itchy and as a child, I didn't have the self-control to not scratch. I would have calamine lotion on them and I guess this was not a good look with orange blotchy dots, and it made me a target. I went from being popular and well like to the 'queen of germs'. I didn't have a single friend until high school. I would avoid all the kids to avoid being bullied. I used to sit by myself every recess and lunchtime, and because of this, I don't think I actually know how to have proper conversations. I think it's a combination of not knowing what to say and the fear of being rejected. I'm seeing the uni counsellor on Tues (we have had a few sessions previously but nothing this full-on) and I want to work through this but I'm not sure how to bring it up thanks so much for your help",Themolequeen,Community Member,06-09-2020,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/recent-unresolved-trauma-from-childhood-content-warning-servere/td-p/506496
PTSD-879,when kindhearted people cant help and professional people go out of their way not to help...,"Hi, new here. and here is my first two cents worth. have suffered mild to servere depression all my life. Almost always forced upon me by others. I have come the the personal epifinay that it is often more a waste of time seeking help or getting it, than it is worth, and my owns self realisation of my situation to get myself out of my ruts, is to use my other traits/flaws/obsessions, to re focus my depression into the only thing I am half good at. and for the lovely kind hearted peopl that try to help on this forum, I will give just a fractional insight. e.g. 1. when the ambulance take you to hospital with a knee puffed up like a balloon and the doctor tells you that I am ""waisting he bloody Time"" (and I watched they playing solitare onthe computer)... that is such a dissinsentice to complain. (grade4 arthritis both knees) I have to stop half way up a flight of stairs to let the pain go down. (the number of times I have been told of by Doctors could fill pages, and the unbelieveable treatmenst I have been given. (taken by ambualce when my pulse was 39, went down to 38, but shown the door when they got me up to 45.. 28 times in emergency ward, so far. 2. professionals like Psychatrists (ordered to attend by centrelink) talking down to you like i am the village idiot. That I may be, but I have changed federal legisation. Doctors in Hospital giving medicines you are allergic to, despit being given red armbands on admission. Doctors saying I am faking thins, despit failing to read earlied doctors notes in my medical history. (one doctor, said I had the worst hearing he had come across in his career. but I can still hear somepeople above the steam whistles & Cicadas (Tinnitus). and constanly being made fun of for it. cant watch TV with out subtitles. (Have woken up Stone deaf on 3 occasions) 3. being made fun of for my poor spelling and typing (despite fighting Dyslexia all my life, and having my right hand sewn back together after a powersaw accident. 6 hours of surgery) I have had 'officials' send back my letters annoted with corrections, and friend even pubished a 'chid' in national magazine about this..

PTSD-880,My ongoing battle with PTSD - some content that may disturb some people,"Hi, I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and its been something that I've been struggling with for a while. Back in November 2019, i was sexually assaulted which really rocked me. I was 17 at a party with my friends, i had a few drinks and got isolated with a guy who would't stop. This has left me questioning myself as a person, and to be honest, hate myself. I blame myself for what happened even though i know i shouldn't. Currently, i'm struggling with dealing mechanisms. Self harm is something that i struggle with and I am now 18, and with that comes many responsibilities. I now have easy access to drugs and alcohol. A privilege which i am abusing and i'm struggling to stop. Not only have i been using that as a coping mechanism, i feel the need to validate myself, and i suppose i feel that I'm not worth anything much apart from a piece of meat for boys. This has lead to me doing things i wish i didnt which has further made me hate myself. If im honest its getting to the stage where i dont know what to do anymore. I've tried so many things to stop. Please if you're reading this, dont ever do what i have done. It turns into a painful cycle. You're worth so much more. I thought that possibly telling my story and opening up about where i am, someone else could feel less alone. Please just know that even though i cant see it right now, i know it has to get better. It has to. Please reach out for help because you're never alone, and if you're reading this i suppose that you're on the right track. You're worth it so keep fighting.",heids02,Community Member,04-09-2020,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-ongoing-battle-with-ptsd-some-content-that-may-disturb-some/td-p/505399

PTSD-882,Newly diagnosed PTSD,"Hi this is my first post and hoping some support may help. I'll first point out my PTSD is no where near as bad as others so I want to make sure people know I don't think mine is super extreme. I had a major surgery at the start of the year that was extremely risky, The biggest risk being paraplegia. I was obviously petrified and did not cope well with the anticipation. Fast forward to post surgery - hospital healing was fine because I had support. However, time spent at home was frightening and downright petrifying. I never sought help for the slow increase in anxiety. I started to feel uncomfortable at home and this fear got completely triggered by being isolated at home whilst waiting for covid results. Fast forward 2 weeks and I've been completely incapacitated Major panic attacks and constant anxiety. Turning into very dark thoughts. Complete inability to live and cope. Medication has been started and trying so hard to overcome little hurdles. I would love to hear some suggestions long term and whether or not this is truly something I will get over (Unfortunately this medical condition is ongoing and will require further treatment)",Mandy29,Community Member,30-08-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/newly-diagnosed-ptsd/td-p/532772

PTSD-884,Healing from childhood trauma,"Has anyone started or overcome the journey of facing and healing the effects of childhood trauma. I’ve only just brought my trauma back to light but have not been able to escape my thoughts about it and it became so overwhelming yesterday I had to call a few hotlines and they still couldn’t put me through to the specialist councillor they wanted to but I still had a chat to one of the everyday councillors and she made me realise that as scared as I am to face my trauma and as much as I feel like I’m not prepared emotionally at the moment, my mind has been made up in some part of my brain and so I’ve decided to face it. I told my psychologist last week I’d been through the trauma and she said she’d refer me to casa (centre against sexual assault) so since my thoughts won’t leave me alone I’ve decided I will tell her at this weeks apt that I’m ready and get the referral started. I feel so bad for my partner and our two kids having to see me in this state. I barely stopped crying yesterday and was just a mess but I also know that I will be so much better to them all if I follow through with it. If anyone has made the healing journey do you have any advice or necessities? I’ve told one of my good friends what I’m about to embark on and she is a teacher at my eldest daughters school so she has messaged the principal and my daughters teacher to say I am going through some stuff at the moment and that I need some space so I won’t have to worry about one of them calling every day to make sure we’re doing school work, understanding everything etc. I had to take the day off yesterday because I’d also had about 3 hours sleep Friday night but I’m going to TRY and go to work tomorrow. I work for my mum so I’ve messaged her and said I’m going through some stuff but I’d try to come to work tomorrow. I just for some reason don’t feel comfortable talking to my family about it and bringing it all back to the surface. anyways I would live to hear anyone’s stories",Anzee,Community Member,30-08-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/healing-from-childhood-trauma/td-p/533054
PTSD-885,"Struggling with triggers during Victoria’s lockdown.. *trigger warning, childhood sexual abuse*","Hi all, I’m new here and anxious to write this post but I had a medical scare in April and ended up in icu and then transferred from my country town to a hospital in Melbourne 2 hours away from home to have a procedure done on my heart. I wasn’t allowed to see my two young kids and their dad was only allowed to visit me twice once I got to Melbourne, thankfully it ended up being a straight forward procedure and my condition was fixed but when I got home I was a mess and had severe health anxiety for a couple of months, quit smoking, drinking and coffee and started a new medication for my anxiety and depression. I had terrible side effects coming onto it and have had to change the dose a couple of times the latest being last week, so I know I’ve been through a lot and have reasons for my anxiety (I’ve been having weekly phone apts with a psychologist since May) but last week something unexpectedly triggered me about years of sexual abuse I went through as a child, I’ve always known it affected me but just left it at that, after going to court etc at 12 years old I did the opposite to what I should have! I shut everyone out, started drinking a lot at about 14 and started smoking cigarettes and going to parties or anywhere I could drink and smoke as I wasn’t allowed to at home anyways that was my way of dealing with it and I thought that was it, it was gone but since this trigger I cannot get the thoughts of trying to overcome it out of my head and I keep telling myself I can’t get past it unless I address it and work through my trauma but right now I am not in the mental state to address that on top of everything else covid has hit my mental health hard and I am struggling with the isolation. The kids dad works away a lot and is away at the moment and we’re in the middle of moving house, I’m working 4short days a week and doing remote learning for my eldest so I am keeping myself busy but as soon as I have a moment to think all I can think about is the trauma I’ve experienced and that I’m never going to get over it so then my anxiety kicks into overdrive and it’s a vicious circle. Sorry this is such a long post I wasn’t expecting it to be haha and I don’t know why I’m posting it here I just think I need to get it off my chest and deep down I think I’m hoping someone will be able to relate and I’ll realise I’m not alonein these feelings.

I am just curious if there is anyway a person can get rid of their memory? My friend says that if they couldn’t remember the event they would feel better. I did some research and read that they are trialling something like this overseas by giving people large amounts of a certain drug to erase their memory, and they’ve had a bit of success although it’s very dangerous.

PTSD-887,Complex PTSD,"Hi, I'm new to this. I have complex PTSD as a result of multiple traumas including childhood sexual abuse, physical, mental & emotional abuse. My father was a violent alcoholic, mother psychologically disturbed, I was raped at 19, my first husband narcissistic, highly manipulative, controlling, possessive, emotionally, mentally abusive, controlled finances, also an alcoholic and eventually threatened violence. Second husband had depression and I believe PTSD. I carried the relationship emotionally and financially until it took a toll on my mental health. I've seen many counsellors over the years, some caused more damage because despite me telling them about my history they never connected that I had PTSD. Finally found a psychologist I could work with and after several years I got to an ok place, where I could coexist with the flashbacks without them overwhelming me. Then my son died, I worked so hard to give my children a happy, healthy childhood, losing my precious boy has devastated me in ways I can never adequately express. 6 years later I met another man, for most part a good man and things were ok until I started having problems with my health. I've had multiple surgeries, too many to count. The last surgery, was horrific. The treatment I received in hospital triggered so much stuff from my past. When I've dealt with trauma in the past, I have had the benefit of compartmentalisation, as a result of what happened to me in hospital, I seem to have lost the ability to compartmentalise. The past 16 months have been a nightmare. My anxiety is through the roof, and the lows have been frightening at times. I have gone back to regular sessions. But as I've dealt with most of my past, except for my father, I have blocked out a lot of my memories around him. I am starting to wonder whether I need to just accept that this is me, I have complex PTSD and that anxiety, flashbacks, depression, insomnia are all part of it. But when I think that there is nothing I can do to change it.......... I go to a very dark place. I have told very few people in my life that I have PTSD and only a handful of people know about my past. I am conscious it's a lot for people to get their heads around. I'm hoping to connect with other people with PTSD, I feel very alone in it sometimes and I'm interested to hear how other people manage their PTSD.

PTSD-888,Not the Victim. Not Sure What To Do,"Long story short: I grew up in a poor home. Nonetheless, my mother did what she could to feed my sister and I. I was sent to live with my father at some point. He was a heavy drug-user and I barely ate so my mother even provided for me when I wasn't in her care. As such, I hold a level of respect and love for the lady. She, herself, came from a heavily abusive home and, as such, she is of a simple-mind and has major emotional issues now days. I recently caught up with a relative who I haven't seen in years. We ended up in deep conversation about growing up (we are the same age), etc. This relative told me that when she would stay over my house when we were children, that my mother would physically abuse her nigh torture her. Some of the things my relative was saying was absurd; it wasn't smackings, it was serious physical abuse. It was upsetting, terrible things that my relative was claiming happened to her as a child, while in the care of my mother on some weekends and so forth. I dismissed these claims as I knew my mother, despite her own horrible upbringing, would not do these things to a child. Then it happened, a day later. I started to recall these things. They started flooding back to me. I could recall the abuse my mother gave to this relative. I could recall my relative running away once, only to be caught, locked in a room, and abused. There was a time when my mother was abusing my relative and I begged her to stop because I couldn't endure hearing the screams any longer. She then made my relative apologise to me like a dog for ""saving her"". I recall lots of it and it has absolutely broken me. I am waking up in the middle of the night just remembering these things and, yet, not one of them happened to me directly. I don't know what to do? I want to confront my mother but her mental and emotional state may lead her to do something stupid to herself. I want to tell my relative I remember but I don't know. I want to tell other family members but they are--to be honest--highly reactive, judgemental individuals. I don't know what I am asking for. I am seeking advice from someone...I am devastated.",The_Wolf,Community Member,26-08-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/not-the-victim-not-sure-what-to-do/td-p/531104
PTSD-889,Being misrable,"Hi, I ve had about 12 years of misery in my life, excluding being sexually exploited at 6 years of age, an alcoholic father, a toxic environment growing up, dating wrong men all my life, to Paint the picture, I have been absolutely misrable most of my life.

I am so unhappy with the life I am living that I cry internally every waking minute of my life. I curse the day I was conceived and born, why was I made to live like this, most people tell me it's fate, askgod for forgiveness, but in all honesty I have never done anyone wrong. Even people that have used and abused me, I have never done them wrong. This can't be karma. Now I have this addiction where I make anyone who is mildly even connected to me misrable, I make my partner misrable I make my family misrable. How do I stop, how do I become happy. I am so unhappy, if Shakespeare wrote my life it would be the Prefect tragedy one of the classics. I feel Some people only born into this world to be misrable so other people who get everything at the right time can feel better about their perfect little lives.

PTSD-890,I think I have PTSD,"I’m 18 yrs old and i’m studying nursing... I have not been clinically diagnosed with PTSD but i think i have it. It started when I found out I had half sister(dad side) when I was 15yrs old and she was few days older than me. Me and my dad had always been very close to each other we have very great relationship, so it was very shocking to me I felt like the person who I trust most and the person I looked up to growing up and everything was just a lie to me. I had this massive trust issue. I felt betrayed by my family on my dad’s side. And my mom who ofc was hurt the most at that time just told me after 3 days to just forgive my dad and just be thankful that he chose to take care of us. I wasn’t happy about it but i felt terrible looking at my dad I saw how sorry he was and he told us he couldnt tell my mom coz he was sure back then that she’d leave her. Anyways time went by and I’ve forgiven him but the scar just stayed in there. I have been dating this guy for 3yrs now and he knows bout my dad. But the beggining of our relationship was not very well (at some ways). He’s very lovely man, whenever we’re together he seems to treat me right and everything else. Everyone who knows us personally thinks we’re like the ‘couple goals’ but that’s not rlly it behind those between our 1st to 2nd yr together... he have this huge feeling on one of my friendd. I knew bout this before we even started dating... we became so toxic as he would tell me how he’s not over her yet then we would have a huge fight then we’ll get back together then 3-4 months latur he’ll admit that he tries to get over her but then She will always have a part in his heart. (They never dated, they were just close to each other but she never liked him) then this pattern went on for about 1 and half yr. (WE’RE OKAY NOT AS A COUPLE BUT MAYBE NOT ME) I know my problem is not as big as everyone else here but this really affected me big time to the point that my trust issue is really bad ANd i wasnt like this before. I’m always open. I just doubt everything (i try not to but because of the things thats going on in my head im like going crazy) but anyways recently i’ve been having nightmares about it. Im getting lots of flashbacks (broad daylight and night) whenever something inconvinient happens or something reminds me bout it. I start to cry and it just keeps hunting me.

PTSD-891,"Tired, scared starting over again.","Spent 13 weeks in Hospital the first half of the year. Diagnosed with Depression by my GP who put me on a plan with a Phycologist. 3rd weeks in for the first time I spoke about my childhood after 50 years of keeping it a secret. Where I broke down. In sort, I was sexually abused raped by 4 different people from the age of 11. I won't go into the details it's still too hard to deal with. While in hospital for 9 weeks at one hospital and 3 Weeks at another health facility I was diagnosed with Major Depression, Complex PTSD, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Dysthymia - (ongoing Depression). During my stay in hospital, it was decided that I could no longer be with my family due to my Mental health and physical health. My wife also has Mental and Physical health problems. I made the choice to move out. My eldest son moved in with his younger brother with their mum. This ended a 40-year marriage. A bit hard to take. We have slowly drifted apart over the last 12 years sleeping in separate rooms. So there I am in hospital homeless and nowhere to go. In the 9th week in the hospital, I finally found shared accommodation 100 mile away from family. Only to find out that 3 tenants were smoking. I did not feel safe, breathing in secondary smoke. I went backwards became more depressed, anxious started to self-harm again thinking I would be better off dead. Community Health Acute Team were keeping in touch with me. Spoke to them said do you want to go to ED? Yes. She rang for an Ambulance. I self-harmed. Lost everything why should I care or want to be heard. Spent 2 weeks in Mental Health Hospital 1 week in another. Then left thought I was good to go. Wasn't I was going back to the same place. One day sitting on the stone wall at the beach watching the waves people & dogs thinking I could quite easily take a long walk into the sea. A dog had run up to me sat on the wall next to me with his head on my shoulder. He would not leave me. His mum called for him to go back to her. He did. The owner & dog came back up to their car. The dog did the same thing again with his head on my shoulder. Both of us went home that day. I finally found a unit which is a lot safer. Second-hand car. Everybody thinks just because I have a unit and car I should be good & happy. I'm not living alone & was self-harming again 2 days ago.

PTSD-892,Introduction/asking for advice or your experiences,"Hi all, Wasn't really sure what forum to put this in but was wondering if anyone knows any resources (especially online, since the covid-restrictions) for, or has any experience of dealing with childhood-trauma but with memory loss? I have a really good psychologist but would otherwise probably be looking for something like a support group also - if there are any? So as to not be triggering (hopefully) - I was already aware there was an environment of abuse in my childhood but had only remembered two moments but I've just learnt more about it from a family member in the last 2 days - including the duration the abuser would've been in my life - and I'm finding it very hard to process her emails, partly because I don't remember it. (I was of an age that you'd normally remember.) As the family member wasn't present physically, we can only cover so much and the information I have is regarding things I would've either witnessed or been in the place when it happened, if that makes sense, it's not towards myself (so unsure if abuse resources covers that) and it's also I guess not a PTSD-issue (as I don't remember)?

PTSD-893,Diagnosed with PTSD and I need to clear out my head,"I agree with my psychiatrist that I have PTSD. I educated my teachers and classmates at a school project. I got bullied for it, even my teachers. They said I should not hold on to the past, and focus on the future, and I should get over it and move on... I was 8 when my father was violent towards me. He did it because my parents were arguing over who is the better parent and they demanded to me who is better. I said I can't choose and my father said he thinks I favour my mother more and so he was violent towards me. I was 16 when I was raped. In broad daylight. At a park. I haven't told anyone, not even the people I trust the most. I was constantly bullied at school by students and teachers. The principal didn't believe me, so I stopped opening up to my parents. Whenever my father found out I got bullied for anything, he said I was an embarrassment to the family. He was violence towards me for either no reason or a very small reason. My parents argued a lot, and I know they weren't arguing about me, but that doesn't make their voices any softer. I can't drive because I fear of having flashbacks and I fear that I might run over a person or crash into a car. I want to move out of house, but I can't find jobs around here, Covid happening or not. I'm almost 21. I constantly worry that I'll end up in a mental health institution and I fear of going into hospital full stop. I hate seeing masks, so I've not gone outside. I feel like the masks are representing mental health doctors. My counsellor just doesn't understand PTSD. My previous counsellor did, but she's now retired. My new counsellor has severe anxiety, and every time she coughs or sneezes she tells me she worries someone might die.

PTSD-894,Do you ever get weird physical symptoms?,"Hi all, This is my first post. Thanks for reading. I've been living with affects of trauma for about 4-5 years. There's something I've wanted to ask for a while, to see if I'm not alone. I won't go into details now but I first developed symptoms after a traumatic event, which was an incident that happened in the process of me trying to end a 6 year abusive relationship. The symptoms started a week later when I was stuck in a situation at work where I felt I might get into trouble. I totally left my body. My legs kept buckling. I was shaking so much I couldn't hold onto things. I couldn't feel my body and it felt like I was looking at someone else in the mirror. Loud sounds made me cry. Everyone's faces looked cartoonishly angry. I couldn't walk properly or at a normal pace. Colours looked bleached. I couldn't think or really explain to anyone what was happening. This lasted for 5 days until somehow, something made me laugh and I started to get feeling back in my stomach. After that I would get episodes of similar symptoms, often swinging between high energy/ anxious states to being completely zoned out and slowed down. It took me a long time to connect what had happened with my ex to how I was feeling. PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS - Does anyone else get these? I still get symptoms sometimes. They are generally less extreme than they first were, but worse and more consistent lately. One thing that's always confused me is how *physical* some of my symptoms are: - Muscles randomly twitching or contracting, making controlled movements hard (like my arms/ shoulders randomly tense up, hands shake) - I get a weird, slow ""gait"". I look stiff like I'm limping or favoring one of my legs. Body generally feels stiff and tight. I can release it for a second but it comes right back. - My breathing feels constricted and slow. - General exhaustion and extreme fatigue after exercise, sometimes for a day or so after. - Dizziness. - My eyes have trouble focussing on things, and just zone out. Or, they dart around randomly. Mental symptoms are usually confusion/ fog/ overwhelm. I can't really ""feel"" very much. Sometimes I can get in touch with my emotions and that helps me get ""unstuck"". But often I forget that there is emotional ""stuff"" there. Are these symptoms familiar to anyone else? Am I on the right track viewing this as a ""freeze"" response? I feel like if I could understand it better, I'd be more confident in how I approach it.

PTSD-895,C-PTSD & Bullying at work,"Hi Firstly thanks for reading and replying in advance. As of late things in my workplace have become increasingly worse. This includes the feelings of being bullied. I had a psychologist appointment Saturday night to which i went through everything that has been happening at work. I automatically went to ,” my ptsd is high”, etc... To her telling me that i am being bullied, that my reactions at work where not my ptsd. They where normal and yes “ valid” responses and emotions. Her suggestion is to leave and find a new job. Ive been there over 7 years, i love my job and what i do. And most people are great. Im afraid to leave. Im afraid of the unknown so much .

PTSD-896,"Workplace issues, PTSD","Hi. I'm reaching out as have recently experienced some difficult issues in the workplace (exclusion, feeling ostracised for speaking up about issues, having my emails accessed and eventually being treated differently by co-workers). I feel the need to say I did not engage in misconduct. I raised problems with managers and it went downhill from there. I have now left the job as it all got too much for me to navigate through. I was constantly on edge. Now having left I feel like I have to try and pick up the pieces. I feel very low, worthless and ashamed like I've been kicked out which I've never experienced before. My worth is rock bottom. The few friends I had there are slowly dwindling, partly on my behalf because I feel like I'm radioactive or something and didn't feel I could keep getting rejected (e.g. if they ignored my message, etc). I feel like I've actually lost my mind and no longer can tell what has actually happened- whether it was me or them. It was probably a bit of both. I have one friend (who doesn't work there) who I have spoken about this too and she has been a great help but I don't want to burden her anymore with it. So, I'm now looking for other work and trying to deal with feeling like I don't want to leave the house. I am now super vigilant and constantly checking what I write in emails, or any messages- checking over everything word by word in case something is wrong or someone else reads it. I'm even scared of posting this thinking someone might see it and know what workplace I'm talking about. Would love to hear from anyone else who can relate. It's just such a horrible, isolating feeling.",Guest_363,Community Member,13-08-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/workplace-issues-ptsd/td-p/518058
PTSD-897,Worried my feelings are destroying my life,"So. Here’s the thing. I have been through a lot. Especially the past 4 years. Assaults, miscarriages, new jobs, failed friendships, I’ve had it all. But the past 6 weeks have been particularly hard. I reported my assault to the police and from there it’s been a whirlwind of emotions. I cry all the time. At everything. I’m on this rollercoaster where I’m up and then I’m down. I started a new job in June and I really loved it. Throughout the reporting process to the police my bosses have been great. They have been by my side whilst I emotionally try to make it through each day. But now it’s different. Now I feel like they see me as broken goods that can’t be fixed. And that’s how I feel. I feel like this is another good moment in my life that my past trauma and all my feelings are yet again ruining for me. The stage 4 restrictions in Victoria haven’t helped. I mean I know they need to be happening, but it’s made everything worse. Work has been my happy place, but now our hours are less and I’m more confined to my house. Then of top of all this I fell over at work and injured my ankle and my knee and now I don’t even know when I’ll be back. I have started to dive into some parts work at therapy which is also another stress. But I know it needs to be done. And hopefully it works. But right now all I want to do is shove all of my feelings back inside and just fade away. Maybe it’s better for everyone. Who knows. My housemate informed me on Friday night that I’m too emotional, I make others around me sad, she thinks I’m autistic and should get tested for that because then at least there would be a reason I’m the way I am. And the worst part. She knows of everything I’ve been through. She knows I’ve got PTSD. She knows I don’t sleep well and she knows I’m in therapy. But honestly maybe she doesn’t care. Maybe this is yet another situation I am in where I am too much for my support network. My network is disappearing. And maybe I deserve to be left behind. I don’t know anymore. I just know I’m sad and tired and I don’t know how much longer I can keep going on like this. Because I don’t want to keep upsetting people, and I don’t want to keep dumping my life on people. Because when I dump on people I let myself feel loved, and then it all comes crashing down, and I don’t think I can do it anymore.",Slipperyfish,Community Member,16-08-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/worried-my-feelings-are-destroying-my-life/td-p/519967
PTSD-898,Is it abuse? Alcoholic boyfriend. Confused,"My partner of 10 years (on and off, mostly on) is an alcoholic, every time he gets drunk he finds something to yell at, whether it be my past, how I was promiscuous as a teen, or how I'm a terrible mother that is doing it all wrong with our 18month old daughter, I had left him for nearly a month and told him to sort himself out, when I went back he was really good but when he gets drunk its on again, if I argue back he gets in my face which scares me (having come from a previous abusive relationship),most of the time I'm too scared to give an opinion in case he doesn't like it, I've lost the ability to make choices on my own. I love him but I dont think its right for our daughter to grow up thinking this is ok.

PTSD-899,PTSD and alone (trigger warning - sexual abuse),"I was abused both physically and sexually as a child by a teacher. The ""usual things were said to make sure I told no one, including obviously my parents. I was also bought up with the old view that boys dont stand toughen up. Unfortunately this really didnt help.only this year have I found the balls (sorry) to try and get professional help. I dealt with this from a young age by turning to alcohol and up until 5years ago was nothing short of a full blown alcoholic. This nearly destroyed not only my own life but my marriage and any respect from my 4 boys. This alcohol abuse did however serve its purpose creating enough mayhem and conflict that there wasn't enough space left in my day to think about my trauma. After nearly losing everything I made the decision to get myself into a rehab facility, staying nearly 12months . My life has not been better, I'm 5years sober (I'm 47) and have a good outlook on life. My wife and kids love respect and more importantly to me forgive me. All great right? Well, since the alcohol is no longer there ""serving its purpose "" I am constantly tormented with vivid nightmares of what happened from the rape and sexual abuse to spending whole days locked in spaces. My path to recovery seems so long and tormenting I find my self wondering how I'm going to make it through the day. This has bought me Here.

PTSD-900,Anniversary of attack,"Tomorrow’s the anniversary of when I was raped. I hate using that word. It feels wrong, it doesn’t fit. People say anniversary and your immediate thought is of positive milestones, happy times, love and other good feelings. But the anniversary of when I was raped.. not something I look forward to or count down to or celebrate all over social media about.. I’ve had to put up with this anniversary before, many times but for some reason this year feels especially heavy. I know it’s just a day, just 24 hours, like any other day. But I can’t pinpoint why this one feels immeasurably large. It’s been building and building internally and I’m afraid to feel all I might feel tomorrow. I’ve done about 3 years of CBT and I’m in the middle of EMDR about 2 months now. Tomorrow will mark 8 years. An 8 year old child around their 8th year of life can typically develop complex language skills, improved attention span and focus. They start to really understand jokes, puns. Baby teeth will start or have already started to fall out and permanent teeth come in. 8 year olds start to really understand cooperation, compassion and what it means to share. 8 years and the night that changed my life forever still renders me useless. Useless to my contribution in the world. Useless in my fight to maintain personal hygiene. Useless in my ability to attend a normal work day. 8 years & I haven’t moved on. And it’s not for lack of trying. An 8 year old child has come from not being able to hold their head up or open their eyes to all of that above.. and what have I achieved. why can’t I move past this, why can’t I feel good, feel okay yet",SuperMeggy,Community Member,03-08-2020,PTSD and trauma,10,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/anniversary-of-attack/td-p/507604

It still scares me every time their name is brought up. It's about my Uncle, more specifically, my Great Uncle. On multiple occasions, they have touched me in places I did not want to be touched, and it made me uncomfortable. They have shown me things I did not want to see, and I haven't told anyone. I have only told a few of my very close friends. I'm scared that if I tell my mum, she will be angry that I didn't say anything sooner, as these things happened when I was around 7. I do not want anything bad to happen, as I usually blame myself for a lot of things, and overthink simple situations. I am also scared I will be called an attention seeker.

PTSD-904,"Sexual assault from a friend, and my boyfriend cheating","Hi all, I'm new here. I have been dealing with the sexual assault from my best friend's(I'll call her Sienna) husband (I'll call him Jeff), I'm getting support from a friend (I'll call her Tilly) that lives far away from me because Sienna is taking Jeff's side because he's very manipulative and she takes his side on everything even though Sienna herself has come to me so many times because he's cheated or been mean to her. I've told her in the past that I would help her if she ever chose to leave him but she always changes her mind after she talks to him again. He has hurt me now and I'm afraid I'm going to lose all the friends that live nearby me that are also friends with them. Sienna and a friend that is also friends with them (I'll call her Pam) just want me to get over it quickly and pretend like nothing happened, and they don't want me to tell anyone else either. Tilly and my boyfriend have been supporting me so well and I have been getting to a point where I'm ok, I've cried, I've been angry and am just starting to accept that I can just leave them and make new friends nearby and It'll all be ok. Until last night, I found a book underneath a cloth that I made for my boyfriend. The book was girly and had flowers on it, I was first suspicious but then I thought my boyfriend was hiding it from me as a present, I got excited and had a little sneak peek but soon found out it just had phone numbers in it, I was dissapointed but then curious, the back pages had been used. I flipped to the back where it had hookup and affair websites listed and then crossed out, I was dissapointed but not really surprised, there had been a girl in the past tell me that he'd been talking to her and flirting, but my boyfriend explained it away with tears in his eyes saying that she is an obsessive ex-friend that just wants to ruin his life. I believed him but made him promise that I can see his phone whenever I wanted, he agreed. So then I thought I could trust him. Please someone with an outside perspective tell what I can do now?

PTSD-905,Advice On Centrelink Disability Pension,"Hi there everybody. This is honestly my first time posting publicly on anything like this and I don't know what kind of response I'm looking for but any advice or success stories would be helpful I suppose. I'm trying to apply for Disability Pension through Centrelink as I am unable to work. The last job I had I managed to last 3 weeks before I ended up having one of the biggest mental breakdowns I've ever had due to stress. My hair was falling out and I had a panic attack leading to an ambulance coming to tend to me. I'm really worried even with all my history, dating back to the age of 9 and I am now 24, I will be denied my claim and forced to look for work which will potentially put me back into a suicidal and vulnerable state. I've been diagnosed by 2 psychologists and a GP with severe depression, severe anxiety, PTSD, borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. I also developed agoraphobia at one stage and couldn't leave the house without having a panic attack for about 3 months. This to this day still comes and goes. I've been having to hand in Centrelink Medical Certificates for the past 2 years to avoid being forced to find work and the last time I handed one in was told by 2 of the staff members that I should be on disability because it was clear my condition was permanent and not getting any better, which it is. I don't know how they can expect one day you'll wake up fine like nothing ever happened, it doesn't make sense. I don't mean to ramble either sorry, I was just ultimately wondering what anybody thought the chances of me getting disability were and if anybody has had any luck. I know it's an incredibly long process and that the likelihood is slim, but I honestly can't work and don't want to be forced to, having to try and defend my mental health every step of the way. If anybody can offer any advice that would be appreciated thank-you.",dj1995,Community Member,09-01-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/advice-on-centrelink-disability-pension/td-p/465344
PTSD-906,Is this emotional/sexual abuse/manipulation? With a fawn response?,"Someone who I'd been on a few dates with and I had a small disagreement where he reacted in a very manipulative way. I felt anxious. We ended up in his bedroom somehow then he was on top of me, grinding on me. ‘Stop’ then more forcefully, ‘Stop!’ He did, and I went home. This was assault but at the time I didn’t realise so stupidly, I went back to his house later to apologise. We went to dinner then he wanted meet his family who’d be at his house soon. I still felt guilty so I agreed. When we went to the house he wanted to ‘cuddle on the bed.’ Guiltly, I again agreed. I felt trapped by sick obligation. I’d been strategically manoeuvred and had no power. And then he was on top of me again, and my hand was undoing my shirt buttons like a slave. But I knew it wasn’t right. ‘I don’t want your family to think badly of me’ I expressed my discomfort. In response he dragged a piece of furniture across the door. Then I’m in denial - this isn’t a ‘make up’ interaction, is it? I asked. This is something else, he told me. I gave up and became a yes-man. Do you want this? Do anything, just be gentle. Do you want that? Yes. I have very strong sexual values so afterwards, I was in denial. I self-deceived saying that it had been my ‘most connected encounter’ and asked if he wanted reciprocation. I even met his family when they came. He invited me to his house twice after that. Once to watch movies or study. Neither of those things eventuated because sexual contact was initiated. And I complied. Sometimes I kissed him first. It’s almost like I knew it was coming and wanted to stop the threat before it happened. Something I now suspect is a fawn response. Sometimes, I felt powerless so I would request something during the encounters - a last ditch effort at control. But I wasn’t in control, I was a puppet being used. He didn’t care for me, it was lies. I was a piece of meat. I tried to convince myself that this person, as they kept implying, was my ‘the one’ but all it was self-deception to quell my anxiety. Eventually, I asked him to take a step back, to put a hold on the physical so we could ‘get to know each other better because I'd never been ready for it. But just like when I’d tried to assert myself the first time, his reaction was emotionally volatile and manipulative. After only a handful of dates, I found my strength and cut off contact.

PTSD-909,Don't know what else to do,"Trigger warning i think.. First post, new to BeyondBlue. In 2012 I was raped, by a stranger. I've lived in denial & told no one, but I can't deny it or hold it in any longer. I can't. He acted like a guy who was interested in me, kind, easy-going and considerate. This image very quickly smashed when he led me to the back of the club we were at, said he wanted to talk somewhere quiet and before I knew it i'd been pushed to the ground & my head was throbbing and i couldn't fight back. I couldn't make him stop. I couldn't move. I couldn't make the screaming in my head vocal. I couldn't alert anyone to my situation and i'd never ever felt more alone. He told me over & over that I liked it & i was enjoying myself & to stop fighting. I fought as hard as i could but it didn't matter. He left me with severe physical injuries that i hid from everyone & still to this day somehow feel pain from, but i can't talk about this out loud. But he left me with much more than physical injuries and its all taking its toll. Every day is a struggle. How can i find value in myself when he picked me & obviously saw something in me that made me easy prey.

PTSD-910,Struggling with the past,"Recently I have been going through a bit of a crisis, not the first one of this sort, and probably not the last one. Just this time it hit me really hard. The reasons that triggered it seem pretty absurd, but it brought lots of bad memories and ugly emotions from my quite dark past, and I mean some 20-25 years ago. I guess back then I could have had pretty bad depression, that was never diagnosed and treated, that eventually dispersed through many neutral and good events that followed, but also the fact, that in the most desperate times I simply closed myself in and didn't care about anything going on inside and outside. I avoided situations that were reminding me of the painful times or literally run away when things started giving me this uncomfortable feeling. I thought that I came in terms with the events from the past, but now I realised I was just sitting comfortably in my bubble of indifference. Now that I have things and people that I really care about, I fear loosing it because of my over-reaction and I feel overwhelmed by these negative emotions. I don't know how to cope with them and I am torn with what I should do. On one hand I just don't want to think about it on the other hand I am tired of holding it all inside and would really want to pour it all out, just have someone to listen.

PTSD-911,after trying to recover for 10 years i am ready to give up,"I feel like i know everything there is to know about ptsd. This is not a good thing. This isn't pride. I have been going to counsellors for more than 10 years. Good ones. I can meditate and be mindful. The large block of pain will sometimes dissipate or go away as i observe it without trying to change it. The tension that developed in my neck won't. It is chronic now. But i can get relief with time and space. But it is not possible to sit 24 hours meditating on my pain. I do not have the means on any normal week. Actually it is clear that the crucial element always missing is that i need social support. I have been trying and failing for maybe 5 years. When i attempted to get my best friend to meet up more often so i could connect more deeply she was angry. ""i don't have time"" or something. She recently has been lonely and apologised for the way she reacted. But i feel we are past that connection i was trying to forge now. I don't really trust her. I have trouble trusting ppl. I lived 10 years with a genuine sociopath while being helpless. My girlfriend does give me comfort. She is understanding. She also has ptsd. She has an anger problem. She has a time management problem, a drug problem, a resultant money problem and low energy to deal. So her connection is real but her support is very limited. She needs to get help herself but procrastinates on that for obvious reasons. And i am also low on energy when supporting her. People in everyday life are very cruel. I take as compassionate an approach to ppl as possible. Mental illness will not make me sacrifice my values of kindness and understanding. Such an approach to life doesn't eliminate cruel people. It makes it harder to understand people though. I feel very alone. Anyway i don't think i'm depressed. I am very sad, literally alone and mainly, very very anxious. After 2 good days of meditating as I am on winter break i felt very positive. Somehow my nightmares became worse though. Last night i could not will myself to sleep. And now i just feel like this uphill battle is never ending. I don't trust anyone to treat me with as much respect and effort as i treat them. I just don't think a person like me can be happy in this world. There isn't enough space to breathe, feel safe and recover. It isn't really fair that i have to keep enduring this pain for others' sake when no one has really helped me. And yes i have been quite open about my mental illness.

So, if you ever experience bouts of depression, then go out for a walk or do some exercise. Sunlight also can help people feel better too. So, get plenty of that. Apart from these things that alleviate depression, keeping life's stresses to a minimum can improve your lifestyle, and keep depression at bay. A further technique that keeps you in a positive mood state is hanging around people who smile and laugh more than negative people. In mindfulness, it is recommended that you keep away from negative people. Then, it will be easier to be happy.",Catz12,Community Member,28-07-2020,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/always-forgiving-people-is-a-positive-start-to-the-day/td-p/485431
PTSD-917,"Scared, anxious and angry","Hi there, Two months ago my ex fiancé held me against my will in our bathroom and threatened to take his life. I’d never felt so scared and trapped in my whole life, and I feel like I’m only now starting to process it. I had no idea how to counteract the situation, so I stayed with him and tried calming him down for over an hour. I managed to escape with what he was threatening his life with and I was able to return him to the care of his parents. What kills me is that, without knowing this particular situation, his family and friends blamed me. All I did was help him, and it frustrates me to no end that I was blamed, and I still get frowned upon, for assisting him in a situation where we were both vulnerable. My ex has always been troubled and has a tendency to threaten suicide when he feels overwhelmed, which others are well aware of because they warned me about it. I care for him and I want him to get better, but I’m dealing with my own emotional fragility and I’m starting to spiral downwards again. Last year I was diagnosed with PTSD. I’d been feeling better up until that night and now I’m worried I’m slowly retreating back into that angry, scared and anxious person. I’m thinking about that night more often and I suffer from really bad panic attacks. I’d really like to connect with others who may understand this particular situation. I just really need to reach out as I can’t see a counsellor at the moment, but would like to as soon as I can.",Rhianna_n,Community Member,27-07-2020,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/scared-anxious-and-angry/td-p/484239
PTSD-918,No more hope,"I feel disgusting talking about it but I’m really suffering at the moment. I have been through a lot in my life including the loss of my parents, the loss of a loved one, sexual abuse, family violence and right now an abusive relationship. Also, once the pandemic started, I felt sick and had all the symptoms of the Covid but there was no place that would test me for it. After doing an X-ray, they found viral infection in my lung but I couldn’t get the thought of having the virus out of my mind. Ever since my mental health has been awful. At 24 I feel like this is the end of the world for me, I have a beautiful little daughter who is very cheerful and loving but being a mum with mental disorder makes me feel sick about myself. I can’t think, I can’t sleep, I can’t find anything that makes me happy and I can’t get out of the house or my anxiety will kill me. I am currently also doing a degree at uni which is another burden for now . I feel like I can’t recognise many people anymore and everything seems unfamiliar for me. The doctor has put me on antidepressants which hasn’t worked as of now but I’m hoping that it will. I’m also seeing a psychologist who is the sweetest person I have even known. I feel very hopeless and worthless at the moment. My partner is no help at all as he believes mental illness doesn’t exist and that we make our mind to always think negative. I’m constantly told many negative things including that I am worthless, lazy, mental and that I have grown in hell. The only reason I’m here today is because of my daughter.",Seeta,Community Member,04-06-2020,PTSD and trauma,44,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/no-more-hope/td-p/475027

PTSD-921,No one is willing to help,"Hi, I am posting here as I have no idea what to do. Heres a brief account of what happened to me. Late 2017 I was involved in an incident while at work where I mistakenly put myself in between a violent male and a woman and her child. In doing so I ended up being physically attacked. Everything seemed fine in the following weeks. Approximately 4 or 5 weeks after something switched in my head. Severe anxiety, depression, stress manifested out of nowhere. This affected me severely. I have approached GP's, attended psychologist and they all have diagnosed me with PTSD but have done nothing to help me address the problem. I feel that these people only prolong the agony to make as much profit from it. Since then everything has gone from bad to worse, I have gone from working where I did make quite a good living to being homeless, living out of a tent, constant anxiety, heart feels like its ready to jump out of my chest most of the time.

John, my little brother's best mate, 6 years my junior challenged me in a swimming race. He won easily. I've always felt inferior to other people, especially blokes. And feeling 'less than' turned into feeling disliked, not good enough and not fully part of the group. My physical best always fell short.

I failed on every physical level as I grew up, despite doing my best.

PTSD-924,New feelings .,"Hello. The past 2 years have been difficult and have dragged up old memories that explain why I do the things I do, react the way I do and feel the way I do. I was abused by my brother when I was younger very early teens something that I have not disclosed to anyone until I told my psychologist this year. It’s something that has altered the way I feel about myself and being intimate. He didn’t physically touch me but he asked me to do inappropriate things and put pornography on when we were alone. He still tells me things that are quite intimate and that clearly make me uncomfortable. We moved counties so my children have never had to be protected as it were until I had to go home as my mum was sick and I took my eldest daughter with me . My brother gave her a hug as it had been 10 years since he saw her and I felt sick to my stomach.

I think we want to do the right thing; we want to treat the ones we love right. I still do and that’s probably my biggest mistake. I have been in an emotionally abusive relationship for a long time, it’s been so long so that I have suppressed half of the things that have happened, the calls to the police, and the locking myself in the bathroom. I have justified the drinking and anger. Because he loves me, and I know he does. He actually loves me like no other. I don’t think I will ever be loved like that again.

I did however find out that he saw a prostitute. It broke my heart. It broke what was left of my confidence. How could he? Also is that something people do?

There was signs there was trouble at home but i didnt believe it could be this serious. My niece asked me if she could stay with us, and i said yes, just not thinking much of it. She said i wouldn't be able to look after her and her sister. I said i would do everything i could. Now that this has happened i should have done something. She is just a little kid.

PTSD-928,Neglect and other types of abuse,"I have experienced over a decade of neglect abuse from my father. My parents are separated. When I was very young, maybe just under 4, I had told my mother about waking up myself and having to get whatever I could reach from the fridge for breakfast. This was all while my dad was asleep.. until after 12pm in the afternoon. I’d always done this and entertained myself while not knowing I was being neglected by my father. There were other instances where my father would not pick me up from school or look after me when he said he would. He suffers from depression and would always use that as an excuse to my mother. But then he would spend about an hour or two with me to stimulate me, so I’d still want to spend time with him. He didn’t realise what he was doing but that didn’t make it any better. Then I copped emotional abuse from my stepdad, screaming, swearing and calling me names when I did anything wrong. He always put me down and then told me I should be greatful for everything he does, like feeding me and giving me a roof over my head. But I shouldn’t have to thank him for that, that is a thing that everyone should have. He even had the audacity to threaten leaving me at my dads house, knowing that I didn’t want to stay there. He does this to my siblings and I can’t do anything about it, if I did I would cop it more than ever. I have been diagnosed with anxiety but I have a feeling it may be PTSD. I had verbal abuse from multiple friends, even when I was very young.. around 5 and 6. One girl basically stopped my best friend hanging out with me whiteout her there too. So she kept my friend to herself and my friend didn’t stop her. She was very manipulative towards my friend and would put me down and poke me even when I told her to stop. She hurt me a lot (emotionally) and I would apologise for doing things to her but she hardly ever apologised to me. She made me even more self conscious than I already was and acted nice at times which made me think that some of the things she said were true. My anxiety is horrible, more physically than anyone I’ve known. But mentally I am surprisingly good at calming myself, when I can. Most people don’t know everything.. I don’t think anyone knows all my trauma is except me. It doesn’t help that I’m out of the closet as bisexual and still in the closet to my parents about being non binary. I am constantly misgendered and called my dead name. If I get a response.

PTSD-929,Trying to cope with PTSD,"Hi Everyone, I am new to this forum and am hoping I can seek guidance and any assistance from those willing to take the time to read my post. I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD from a sexual assault incident that happened within the work place starting two years ago. I was assaulted by someone I trusted and looked up to aka my manager. It started off with just comments about how my boyfriend and I ended our relationship and how I could do better, this led to other more inappropriate comments. He never targeted any of the other girls as they all had partners and as I felt so low from my break-up I was an easy target. Things progressed to get worse through the year and I was sexually assaulted in an office before he was moved to another location. I never said a word as who was going to believe me over a well respected manager. I finally told one of my friends at work and when our new manager started she let it slip what had happened to me over the course of the 2 years. My new management informed my regional manager and the case was investigated but before the accused could be informed he got a tip off from someone and quit his job before he heard the accusations against him. My work then decided to sweep it under the rug after they found in my favour and I was told never to mention it again. In February of this year I had a mental break down after two months from the investigation and all I could think was how I wanted to end my life. I ended up leaving my job that I loved so much due to my PTSD and not coping. I have always struggled with depression and anxiety since my dad passed away 10 years ago. I was going so well after meetings with my amazing therapist that I’ve seen for nearly 10 years but this week has hit me like a tone of bricks and I’ve cried every night wishing the pain to stop. I feel like I can’t tell my mum, who I live with, as she feels since I’m medicated I should be on the right track and not feeling how I am. I am already ashamed. I’m struggling to get back into the work force and to find who I once was as a person. I feel everything has gone down hill from friends, family and the guy I was interested in. I lack confidence and struggle to see the good anymore but I’m very good at hiding it all with a smile so no-one thinks anything is wrong by looking at me, but it’s eating me inside. Any assistance or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you - MacGirl7.",MacGirl7,Community Member,14-07-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trying-to-cope-with-ptsd/td-p/472270
PTSD-930,I need help,"Last year I fell in love with a boy, I had never met him, though we shared a mutual friend. He lived in a city 3 hours from me. I got his snapchat from my friend and we started talking instantly. He was everything I was looking for. Because of our distance and neither of us having a license we could only develop our relationship online. We would text, call and FaceTime constantly. After about 6 months of talking to him, I thought it might be the time to finally meet him. We got our parents to agree and next thing I knew, he was staying for a week in the school holidays. The first day he came down, everything went perfectly. It was like being in a romantic movie, we held hands and went on a cute date, i was in love. Then the second night come around, and everything went down the drain. Me and this boy were drinking. We had decided to call it a night, both of us being highly intoxicated, thought bed was a good idea. We got into bed and he asked if I wanted to have sex. I thought about it for at least 10 minutes, being drunk I was weighing my options of whether this was a good idea or not. I finally agree and from the moment everything was terrifying. I was scared. About 5 mins in, I told him to stop and he didn’t listen. Eventually, he stopped of his own choice and I made an excuse to stay in a seperate room. This happened September last year. Ever since then, everything has gotten worse. I started having severe anxiety attacks, out of no where, nothing triggering me. I have lost a lot of weight, I eat once a day, I have lost interest in everything. I lost my job. I sleep all day, and stay up all night, either thinking or crying. I have these stages where I’m watching myself and I have no control over my actions. I often take drugs to get away from the real world. I need help and I’ve spoke to to sexual help people and therapists and councillors and it doesn’t help. I come off worse. Doctors in my town just refer me to headspace, even when I explain it doesn’t help and I’ve tried. I know I’m mentally ill and it drives me i don’t know with what.

But now I’m stressed and anxious and really not coping. I thought reporting would make me feel better but it’s honestly made it worse. There are now so many steps that need to happen and there might not even be an arrest at the end. My boss from work also came with me to make the statement. I was feeling stressed that she wanted to come but it was nice having support. But now I suppose I’m panicking about going back to work tomorrow. She knows so much now and I feel like she will never look at me the same again. Ah it’s just all so overwhelming. On top of that I reckon I’ve only slept about 3 hours each night since last Tuesday and I’m not eating. But honestly I don’t feel hungry and the thought of food makes me want to vomit. Anyway. That’s where I’m at. I think I’ll call the police tomorrow and double check all my options. I want him to be held accountable and get in trouble, but I also know that I don’t think I’m emotionally stable enough to do it. But then I feel like I’m letting people down.

PTSD-934,Sexual trauma and deep regrets,"My cousin is the same age as me (20). We were quite lonely so having someone to talk to especially being family meant a lot. I invited him over for his birthday, we ended up drinking quite a lot. I was borderline tipsy-drunk but still self aware. He was very drunk. He got very touchy, kept complimenting me, saying gross things about me, hugging me (in an uncomfortable, somewhat intimate way) and kept kissing my cheek. (this is the first time anyone has touched me like this and is very uncomfortable for me). He talked about and asked me so many disgusting, rude, uncomfortable questions but me in my drunk state I just answered! Im so ashamed of myself. It was horrible. This is my cousin!!! Although not blood related someone who I saw as family and I feel so uncomfortable, ashamed and disgusted. I havent talked to him since. It was traumatising. I was scared. Not long after, a friend from work who is 37 years old (could be my fathers age lol) we went out to a restaurant together. I found comfort in him as I have always longed for an older brother and that is exactly what he was to me. I cant even remember everything that happened but whenever I do I panic and feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself. We were so drunk. I remember I was so tired, I just wanted to sleep. He took me to a motel room while I was crazy drunk, i cant even remember getting there. He wanted to have sex. Words cant describe how ashamed I am over myself because of that night. We didn’t go all the way but he still did everything else to me and I hate it. (for like 35-45 minutes I'd say? im sorry i cant go into detail. I cant handle the stress when I remember/think about it) I let him do it. He asked if he could do anything he wanted and I said yes. I was so drunk and tired I couldn’t think properly, I didn’t even really know what was going on. I just remember thinking, ‘hes my friend, so its okay’. He touched me everywhere. Whenever I remember everywhere he touched and the things he did to my body my anxiety becomes horrible, i freak out and start hyperventilating. It terrifies me and I feel so disgusted and ashamed of myself. Later he confessed that he loves me and wanted to be in a relationship. I was so upset. The same situation happened as my cousin but worse. These are my fault as I was drunk, and with the second instance I consented at the time. I feel horrible. I want to reserve intimacy for my partner..not this. my first time being touched and kiss was stolen in horrible ways. First of all I am 20 years old. Ive never been on a date (only ever 2 boyfriends who were long distance), no physical intimacy before. Im very shy and quite reserved. I want to reserve all of this for someone who I love and am in a relationship with. Now im terrified of everyone I get close to, that they have an ulterior motive, that I cant trust them and I become so scared to be with them. Im now scared everyone at work sees me in a different way to what I was expecting and are going to try to do things to me. Im scared of making friends and going out with people in case something happens again. But mostly the hatred i feel for myself is so strong, im so ashamed of myself for allowing it. Its all my fault... Please, I am not comfortable with seeking therapy at this stage which is why I am coming here. I would appreciate your thoughts/opinion and anything to comfort the turmoil I am in with these situations that recently happened. Writing this itself is making me feel absolutely horrible with my anxiety however I feel the need to get comfort and this is a big first step for me.

As were my siblings..I left home at 15yrs young,to be safe and not feel scared anymore. I ended up being a ward of the state,and was fortunately placed with a lovely family. I stayed with them until I was 17..I left the state angered that despite disclosing to my mother everything that happened,she didn't believe me..yet..Then I met my future husband and partner of our 4 beautiful children. It started off seemingly good,but when all you've known is abuse, violence and exposure to zero communication skills,nor boundary setting. You don't realise being abused is not 'normal'..I stayed with him for 12yrs,through his cheating/gambling/drinking(father was also an alcoholic)/manipulation/drug abuse/mental instability. Because I was taught""good girls don't cause a fuss"" ""he's probably had a bad day"" and so on.... I tolerated it as long as I possibly could,to the point it nearly killed me.. LITERALLY..he strangled me in front of our eldest. That was the final straw..I seperated from him..he threatened me with killing himself if I didn't take him back.. 1 week later he completed suicide,and SENT ME A VIDEO of him doing it.. It's been 10 yrs since that day,I lost my house/my hopes/nearly everything. And had a nervous breakdown. My kids are now adults and still struggle with severe PTSD and trauma.

Our life is idyllic in many ways but I can't shake the self-hatred, the hyper-vigilance, the anger, the intense desire to be on my own in the bush with no one else around. I'd self-diagnosed with everything but I've never just admitted that it was trauma based as opposed to a mental illness lacking precipitating factors. My father was abusive. It seems so strange to say as he's such a quiet old man now. The physical things were just the little things though. The biggest horror was the emotional abuse. His hair-trigger. My sister and I would walk home from school, peering over our fence to see if his car was there. If it was we'd both have bricks in our stomach...I'd have sweaty palms. I'd ready myself to avoid him lest I drew his anger. He'd oscillate between the funniest man in the world, who'd do anything from his kids but he'd turn on a dime and tell us he never wanted us and we'd ruined his life. But here I am. Up since 3am thinking about it. I don't allow myself to see it most of the time, what I'm thinking of that makes me so on edge. I just think I hate myself because I'm fundamentally flawed, and I congratulate myself on a sharp diagnosis. It's hard to talk about. He's a nice man in his heart, and other children have been abused horrifically in their lives. Both arms have been tied behind their back, while I have only one tied behind mine. Enough complaining for now. I'm still figuring it out. I want to be a better man.",larrygreen,Community Member,06-07-2020,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-get-the-feeling-that-somethin-ain-t-right/td-p/458293
PTSD-938,Depression & Anxiety after partner cheated while on a drug bender,"My story is that I was 38 weeks pregnant with my second child and due to some bleeding I had to be flown via the flying doctors to hospital which was a long way away. My partner stayed behind to look after our son (which because of covid couldnt visit the hospital) and organise everything and then a few days later got over to stay and see our beautiful little boy be born. I thought all was well apart from a real funny feeling. When we finally got home a week later I could not shake this feeling of something had gone on while I was gone, so while my partner was sleeping I checked his phone and there hidden was messages and videos from a woman he works with. It was said in the messages that it would now unfortunately have to end because I was coming home. I immediately woke my partner and questioned him over it! He admitted he was on a drug bender and it had just happened. He has a history of drug abuse but had not done it for a really long time. He says it only happened that one night while I was away and I'm not sure if I believe him. The other thing is I am so upset he had our 18 month son with him but had put him to sleep on the couch while under the influence of drugs and drinking. He has made every effort to got to drug counseling etc and talk to me honestly about everything when ever I need to talk. I am struggling with everything right now from trusting him while he is at work because she works there too, not being able to stop thinking about it all, cry on and off all the time, depression, not feeling like I'm enough as a person, mother and partner. Feeling like I'm living in a haze and there is no way out! I do not want to end our relationship because I love him dearly, he is such a strong, loving, caring, supportive, and awesome father and this is the first time he really fucked up! What can I do to get through this? And what more can he do?",mer5306,Community Member,03-07-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/depression-anxiety-after-partner-cheated-while-on-a-drug-bender/td-p/455195
PTSD-939,Driving people away,I’ve recently started seeing a psychologist and am on antidepressants to help with anxiety and PTSD as a result of growing up with a narcissistic father (psychologists words not mine - she met with him and my mum and my sister when my parents divorced). The emotional and physical abuse shaped who I am today and recently I’ve started to deal with everything I’ve been through because in the past I’ve just soldiered on but that’s not working so well for me now. In my bid to try and work through this baggage I found myself unloading the depths of my mind on a close friend and I know it’s all become too much for him. I have been so emotionally dependant and needy that it’s caused a shift in our friendship. He’s been absolutely supportive and dealt with countless meltdowns and in no way has he failed me but I know it gets to be too much and he ends up finding himself busier in life as a way to get his own downtime and a break from my crazy anxiety. He takes longer to reply or times things to make conversations shorter. Little subtle things all while trying his absolute best to reassure me he is always there because I know he wants to be but just can’t. So my answer to driving him away is to call it out and tell him that I know he needs air and he needs for me to stop relying on him so much. He didn’t disagree but said he doesn’t want me to feel let down. I’ve cut him the slack he deserves and have pulled away. I’ve told him to get the air I need and suddenly I’m back to a state of panic. My safety net is gone and I’ve gone back to feeling like the burden I grew up feeling. I’ve gone back to feeling like I don’t matter enough for anyone to fight for me. My partner is so supportive and so loving but I don’t let my emotional baggage intrude on my relationship. My friend was my leaning post because it kept my relationship safe from the damage that my emotional self would cause. Now I feel alone and as much as I feel desperate to reach out to him I know I need to give him this space and air. I know I need to stop needing him but it leaves me terrified because he’s been my rock. I have no replacement. I have no safety net. I don’t ever want to ruin my friendship and leaning on him the way I have is just not fair. It’s affecting his own mental health. So what do I do now? How do I stop needing someone? How do I stop feeling like I’m falling? I don’t have his hand to grab on to anymore and it’s making the anxiety rise more and more.,phoenixwaitingtorise,Community Member,24-06-2020,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/driving-people-away/td-p/493274
PTSD-940,Really not sure what to do....husband is a sex addict,"I'm not 100% sure that I'm posting in the right spot but I thought that this post may offend some people, so I shouldn't be posting in the new members area. To try to cut a very long story short: my husband of 20+ years is a sex addict. When we first moved in together, we had a regular sex life - but looking back on it, not normal. He was always ""zoned out"", I felt like he wasn't present when we had sex. He was there in person, but certainly not in mind. Within seconds of finishing, he was asleep. He always had his eyes closed, and tried to avoid any kissing, and there was no foreplay at all. Fast forward a few months, he was pushing me away. He joined Whatsapp and I saw messages on his phone from women younger (after I looked them up on FB) than his daughter (from previous marriage). I told myself that I was stupid for looking at his phone, by the way these messages were coming up on the homescreen. I wasn't unlocking his phone as I didn't know his password. I realised that something was really off, and I discovered that these messages were all from prostitutes. Some he was in ""relationships"" with. Buying them gifts, giving them money etc. I might add that at this point in time, we didn't have a joint bank account. I was continually worried about paying bills and didn't know where all his money was going. He kept telling me that he had to help out his ex-wife or his daughter so I couldn't really question him any further. I left him once but a couple of days later he got his mother to ring me and beg me to come back. He rationalised everything that had been going on, I now know that he was gas-lighting me. It got to the point where I had to hire a P.I, I couldn't prove what was going on and I was extremely anxious all the time. I spent thousands having him followed but the PI couldn't catch him. Two days after I sacked the PI, I found proof. Of course, he denied and tried to say I was mad and crazy. I more or less forced him into therapy. There was individual therapy for both of us, followed by couples therapy for almost two years. Then he cut it all off. Two years after the therapy ended, I have caught him out again. Screwing prostitutes only several days after the covid restrictions have been somewhat reduced. I have told him to return to therapy or move out immediately. He is going back to see a therapist next week (first available appointment). I'm running out of space to write but can tell more if anyone asks.

PTSD-941,Why can't i ever stand up for myself?,"I had a big trigger 2night or last by the time ive finished this. It might seem like nothing to anyone else but to me its upsetting. I had a friend i met 8yrs ago who we met through our dogs being service dogs. She was super clingy from the start and wanted me to move in with her to be her carer. The warning signs were there to back away but i felt too guilty because she had a noticeable physical disability so i stuck around and had let her use me. Very long story short the last time we spoke was a long time ago when i got an inheretance when my beautiful mum and nana my mums mum passed away. The day after i recieved the money she said the same thing every single day for a full month saying i wish i had someone in my family pass away so i could get $10, 000 to renovate the bathroom for when her physically disabled husband will need a wheelchair permanently. After a month i gave in and gave that amount of money to her. I knew she wasnt going to give in and i thought a paid human friend is better than no human friend. 2 days later she showed me pictures or a cruise they we're going on. The following months i tried to let it go but it was eating me up inside and i texted her what i felt. She ended contact after that which secretly i was glad. Last night she turned up out the blue with her dog and started talking about the bathroom ndis are paying for. Her very large dog ran back and forth from my wet garden and garden bed through all my carpet and she said you dont mind i let him run around cause he hasnt been off the lead for a week. Of me being the wus i am said of course not. I have spent hrs cleaning up after and have to get my carpet cleaned which i currently cant afford. She wants to come back in a few days.

PTSD-942,[low priority] Is this considered trauma?,"Hey everyone, I've been talking to a friend recently about my upbringing and she thinks I might be suppressing trauma or trying to minimise or pretend that bad events just haven't affected me at all. Family stuff - my household is generally really chill, parents are together, no glaring problems. It's just that as long as I can remember, my dad's been really sick (chronic illness) and I've had to take care of him as well as myself and my brother. I've been fully independent in caring for myself since probably age 5 or so because I had to be - even cooking (or rather just eating whatever I find within reach) and fixing things around the house (and recently, getting my learner's with the sole purpose of taking pressure off my parents). Mum works more than full time, dad's incapacitated by his illness, and that leaves me to try to keep my brother under control most days. I don't do this very well though, as I'm just really exhausted and have been withdrawing emotionally from everyone for years, because I just don't have the energy to do this stuff. And that makes me feel guilty, too, because it leaves my mum to try to look after everybody and she's clearly just as tired. So now my brother and my mum fight all the time, dad's still sick and can't mediate, and I just withdraw/dissociate/pretend to sleep or something to avoid it. And then there's the actual illness. Can't count the number of times I've seen my mum forced to argue with/pressure/guilt hospital staff into putting my dad on much needed oxygen when he's about to die (and the doctors are just like ""oh its chill he's just psychologically stopping himself from breathing, he'll snap out of it""), while my brother screams at her for not letting him use mobile data for his games because he doesn't have wifi at hospitals (and I'm not mad at him, he's just too young to understand). I just feel bad for my mum and want to help, but I'm completely useless all the time. People keep reacting with shock and are trying to convince me that this is valid trauma but it just... doesn't feel like enough. Everyone goes through loss and people die all the time. My family's not broken, abusive, neglectful or anything. My parents try their absolute hardest, to the detriment of their mental health as well. I don't think I have PTSD or anything, I just want to work out how much I'm actually being affected by the way my upbringing went. I don't even know what people mean when they ask about my 'past trauma', to be honest.",KazooRights,Community Member,02-07-2020,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/low-priority-is-this-considered-trauma/td-p/442660
PTSD-943,Can’t sleep,"Hi, Just struggling to sleep. A lot of the trauma I went through was related to the time I spent in bed. I probably only got maybe 3 or 4 hours a sleep a night when I was a child. Now it’s so hard to sleep, I find myself hypervigilant. My children both sleep in my bedroom with me (my eldest on a rollaways bed) it’s the only thing I can do to get at least a little sleep. I lock the door and feel safer. My eldest is ten and yesterday he wanted to sleep in his own room and I said okay. I tried but as soon as I went to bed the trembling started and I was so terrified I took him back to my bedroom. I feel like I’m failing him, because a boy should be able to sleep in his own room and not have to keep his mother company because she’s too afraid to sleep with her bedroom door unlocked. I just see them, you know. The people who’ve hurt me. I imagine them climbing in windows and kicking down doors. I imagine them creeping down the hallway to my bedroom and finding me asleep. These images are honestly terrifying. So I lock the door and I force my kids to sleep in my room. I’ve had counselling to try to deal with this, she got me to consistently try to sleep with the door open. It didn’t work and I tried it for 9 months. What ended up happening was that I’d fall asleep but even the slightest breeze would wake me so I was never going into a restful sleeps I’m just exhausted. I don’t want to do this forever. I don’t deserve this. I was just a child and I should have been safe and protected so I didn’t have to grow up with so many issues. Instead I’m tired and afraid every single day and the worst thing is that I feel like nobody sees it and if they did nobody would care.",Ishtahandmirabi,Community Member,29-06-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/can-t-sleep/td-p/435869

PTSD-945,Living with my abuser.,"Hi, I am currently living with my father. He has abused me my whole life. I have been avoiding him the best I can for a very long time. I lock myself in my room and only leave if he has gone to work or I have to leave for school. I went to the police a few weeks ago to get an intervention order but was unable to get one due to my broken fragmented memory and because of the statute of limitations. I fear that he will hurt me or maybe even kill me. He has threatened to kill me and do other things if I ever told anyone about the abuse multiple times in the past and know he knows I have. I can’t sleep at night and tick all the symptoms for CPTSD. I am currently seeing the school psychologist and another psychologist out of school. I constantly have intrusive bad thoughts and it’s debilitating. None of my other family members really believe me and justify his actions. I doubt myself and question my sanity all the time but I know this really happened to me. What should I do? I hate living with him. I might go to boarding school but I would have to live with him on the holidays. I don’t really have any close friends and I don’t want to ask any of them if I can live with them because I don’t want to give them that burden and I have trust issues. I believe he has antisocial personality disorder and is a sociopath. He didn’t grow up in very good conditions and he has never shown any empathy, remorse or guilt. Is my fear of him irrational, is it just a symptom of CPTSD? He has hurt me hundreds of times but it hasn’t happened as lately because I started fighting back, got bigger than him and began avoiding him. I can’t remember much of the abuse but I have memories coming back all the time. Should I try mend my relationship with him even though I don’t want to, I hate him and I really doubt he will change? He tries to justify his actions. I think he enjoys doing it and he is always trying to assert control over me my touching me inappropriately, taking photos of me and humiliating me. He psychology, emotionally and verbally abuses me, making me question reality and believe in his deception and lies. I’m still dealing with the things he has done to my so many times and for so long and I don’t know how to recover. I really don’t know what to do. My mother tells me I should forgive him because it happened “a long time ago” but it didn’t, I feel like it’s still happening even if it isn’t, I don’t want to and he is no different to the days when he was bashing me and he doesn’t even feel sorry. I fear for my safety every moment, I’m really paranoid and I want to get out of here and I’m afraid I don’t really have any options. I can’t move out, I won’t survive, I’m only 16, I have no money, no job, no where to go.",Jonathan03,Community Member,24-06-2020,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/living-with-my-abuser/td-p/497976

PTSD-949,Cautious,"Hello, I've written this post under PTSD although I have not be diagnosed and I have never sought help. I have however been researching to try and find out why I am like I am and why I can't seem to get past it. This evening I thought I would Google PTSD and see whether my symptoms match at all. Gosh, nearly all my symptoms match what I read. My GP would call it Dr Google but we live in an information society and finding out how my suspicions match PTSD is a relief in itself. I believe my life changed in 2013 so I've been carrying this for several years already. During 2013 I had a very nasty employer who wouldn't listen to reason and then sacked me. I was encouraged to pursue him and her for unfair dismissal and other charges. I did, and I won, but the victory was shallow and I've been badmouthed all over the city I live in and consequently have not held a job more than a few months since. In the same year my much loved springer spaniel died at almost 16 years, and following that only a month later I was diagnosed with breast cancer. As I have read in other posts, my family don't believe in mental health and I am told to ""get over it"" and ""get on with it"" both of which I find insensitive and unsupportive.

PTSD-951,Trauma post bushfire and subsequent miscarriage,"Hi this is my first time posting or really reaching out at all. Sorry it’s really long. Just a little background, I’m Lily, I’m 23, and in 2018 I moved from England to Australia to marry my husband. It was an extremely hard decision and I’m still incredibly homesick over my family and friends back in England, but it’s been worth it as my marriage is amazing and my husband is truly my best friend. As a wedding gift he built a house for us to live in. In December 2019 I discovered I was pregnant again after a previous miscarriage earlier that year. Things were looking up. We were dealing with the fires but only to a minor degree, even the RFS said our house was safe and well defended. Unfortunately huge winds picked up in January whilst we were at home, we ran and hid in a neighbouring house’s bathroom with wet towels around us whilst our house burnt to the ground, terrified we’d be the next to burn. I was truly convinced we were going to die, flames were literally licking the windows. We ended up shaken, but alive, and fortunately found somewhere new to live quickly and were helped out a great deal. And then I had a miscarriage three weeks later. It was the most brutal and agonising thing I have ever endured and I was completely neglected by the medical staff who accused me of being a hypochondriac until I passed out from the pain & complications in the waiting room. As it turns out my chances of having children in the future are extremely slim. I haven’t even begun to wrap my head around that yet. I’ve really kept this all fairly secret and miscarriage feels like such an awkward taboo topic. I previously suffered from PTSD due to being raped at a party when I was 14. I’ve been doing really well with this until now, but after all of the above, and losing my job, and being so far from parents and best friends, it’s really all flared up again. I’m not suicidal because despite everything I still really love life, but am just struggling to function and do normal things again like job hunting. I’m very good at pretending I’m fine so people see no issue in bringing up stressful topics like my unemployment and immigration status (currently working on my visa) because they don’t realise I’m not coping and don’t understand why I’m being “lazy”.

PTSD-954,Aftermath of child sexual abuse. Separation,"Two months ago I became a single parent. I was with my partner for ten years. I have a daughter from a previous relationship, and we share a four year old son together. We also have a joint mortgage. My twelve year old daughter told me she had been sexually abused by her stepfather. It happened more than once. I am a shift worker and the abuse happened when I was on night shift. I still feel sick thinking about it. I confronted my x, but he denied it. That night we fled the family home and stayed with family for a few days. He eventually left the house, so my children and I returned to our home. I felt like I had no choice but to inform police. Then followed an apprehended violence order. He ended up getting arrested, but released on bail with strict conditions. I felt so guilty and confused. I still cared about him at the time even though he did these horrible things. I think most of those feelings have since developed into pure hate and anger. I am angry at him. I am angry at myself for not knowing what was happening. When we first met I thought I had met someone really amazing. It didn't take long for things to go pear shaped. He was a heavy drinker. Drinking turned him into someone else. He had a short fuse. He humiliated me in public. He was so controlling. I was not allowed to spend $10 on myself. My daughter and I have started counselling, however I feel the road to recover is going to be very long. I had to go on medication to function. I am sick of pretending I am okay when I'm not. I have continued going to work to support my family but it has been an effort. I can't tell my work friends the truth. It is too full on. I just say I had to separate as he did something that was unforgivable. It is like bottling everything up inside. Things just got worse as I heard from his lawyer the other day. It is clear he wants us out of the house. It has only been two months. I am too miserable to sort my life out at the moment. Now I have had to organise legal advice and an evaluation on the house. I don't think I can afford to buy him out. I am worried we may become homeless next. I am worried about money. There will be lawyer fees and my daughter needs braces. How do you ever recover from something so horrible? How do you ever trust someone again. The pain is too much. The betrayal is too huge.

PTSD-955,Losing the war with myself,"Hi everyone. I first posted in this forum 5 years ago. Everything that had to do with mental illness, medication, treatment was new to me and the people on this forum helped me heaps, I have PTSD from childhood sexual abuse and from war. Bipolar. Anxiety. Bushfires and Covid haven’t helped. Since that first post I’ve lost my job because of discrimination. I tried to kill myself twice. I’ve had countless admissions, meds, one on one and group therapies. I work hard to implement what I learn, I try not to work so hard... I try new things, I try old things... I’ve lost friends and family, made new friends, lost most of them... I don’t know what else to try, I feel defeated.",Guest_2350,Community Member,23-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,12,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/losing-the-war-with-myself/td-p/443076
PTSD-956,Marriage problems,"I have been with my husband 25 years, i feel like I do still love him but hate him at the same time for the way he treats me and destroys our life. We have been together 25 years and there has been a long history of Domestic violence, abuse, cheating and dishonesty. I cannot trust him. The violence has now stopped but he has now started with emotional abuse. I left him in August last year and then he begged me to come home after 8 weeks, I finally came home because he promised me the world (all fake promises, just telling me what I wanted to hear). By Christmas he abandoned me on Boxing Day for 2 months, I never saw him and he never spoke to me for the 2 mths. February I went to see a Solicitor and they sent him a serious letter, he then called the Solicitor saying he wanted to work things out with me. My brother has just passed away and now he has abandoned me again and I have not seen or spoken to him for the last 3 weeks. I cannot go on like this but I am suffering from depression and PTSD from the trauma he has put me through. He is a narcissist and very controlling and manipulative. He is good at Gaslighting and giving me this silent treatment to make me feel guilty so I come crawling back to him! It is just a cycle of abuse that never ends I just don’t know how I am ever going to get away and feel as though I can survive on my own I am so scared. He has made me co-dependant. I want to be on my own and he happy but feel like I still love my husband but cannot keep letting him treat me the way he does. Does anyone have any experience with this abandonment? Is it another form of abuse? He never used to do this before? I have tried for so long to get him to address our issues and problems and attend marriage counselling together but he just runs away from the truth all the time! We are living separately in the same house!

PTSD-958,repressed memories from childhood,"lately a topic i hadn't thought about in a couple years has become prevalent again because i started opening up to a friend, for some time i've thought something happened to me as a child, that someone did something sexually inappropriate to me as a child. when i was 16 was when the idea and thought effected me the most because an incident happened when seeing family members, though the incident was small, what really effected me was how it made me feel, i completely sank into myself so much so that the world felt like it was closing in and i felt like i was going to throw up, it effected me so much after that because it felt like i was a child and i had no voice, and it took me to such a place that almost felt repressed, it felt like it dwelled up all this disgust and guilt and shame that was so familiar but i hadn't felt for a very long time. after the incident i just left the kitchen and went to my bed (we were staying in a rented home for a family members birthday ) the next day, i asked my dad to wear his hoodie even though we were in qld and i was sweating , but i just wanted to hide and get the rest of the day over with and go home, i started to feel guilty for wearing so much makeup and acting older than my age, but in hindsight i did feel a little nervous going there and that was my way of putting a mask on , by acting grown up. although to some it might seem insignificant it pushed me into a full blown thing for the next year because of the way it made me feel , it felt like such a trauma on my body that i was convinced something had happened when i was younger. other reasons before that i had thought something happened was because i used to feel unwell everytime i was in qld, the smell, the feeling of the air,when i was younger i would feel it and i tried to push it from my mind ( my dads side of the family live in qld and we would visit them every so often when i was younger) ive had body dysmorphia since i was as young as i can remember, i used to try starve myself when i was like around 7 id say and onwards, keep in mind i was a thin kid, i remember i used to get really uneasy unwell feelings around men when i was younger and male authority figures, like teachers, principles, bosses!! and i always for no reason feel slightly resentful and bitter towards them, like when someone makes you uncomfortable and your only defense is to disregard their character even when none of them did anything wrong and were all actually quite polite, even though this is the case a lot of my sexual thoughts were always around someone with authority. my dad was also kind of not great at times and didnt put us kids in the best of situations when we were young, because of a court order i wasnt even allowed to leave the state with him until i was seven, my mum has expressed a lot that she always worried something happened to me as a kid or something would . ive had bad anxiety control since i was a kid, i couldnt eat in public , starving myself comes up all the time in my life since i was a kid.",Ambivalent,Community Member,16-06-2020,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/repressed-memories-from-childhood/td-p/485484

PTSD-960,Had enough... feel like giving up. VERY COMPLEX PTSD,"I’ve always experienced anxiety and depression from years of sexual, emotional and physical abuse. I grew up in a house where my dad was an alcoholic and was violent towards my mum. When I was 6 years old I was first sexually abused by my neighbour. Then my grandfather for 20 years. Then witnessed a sexual assault on My friend and sexual abuse for me. Another 3 of 4 episodes of this. And I sought help from VOCAT and did PTSD counselling. but the last 12 months of my life have been the worst of my life and it keeps getting worse I’m starting to think it’s me. my depression and anxiety was getting better. Until my mum (the one person I could talk to about anything ) got diagnosed with a stage 4 brain cancer. She was given 12-18 months later. She died 6 months after I took her into hospital. 3 days after my mums diagnosis my Aunty commit suicide. A month later my grandfather who had been sexually abusing me my whole life died, I had to take my mum to see him, because she was sick. First time I had seen him in years then I got stuck planning the funeral. My mum got married to her partner of 20 years but my brother tried to commit suicide 2 days after the ceremony. We spent my mums last birthday in the psych ward. Then my mum went into a coma just before Christmas (all this while working and looking after mum) then she died a couple day’s after Christmas. After my my mum died everything got harder. My brother went out of control again (he has a drug addiction) he believed we murdered my mum and she never had brain cancer. He tried suicide again and has had another stint in the psych ward. we hadn’t heard from my Aunty in NZ did a welfare check and she had passed away of some kind of cancer that affected her scalp and eye. So I had to tell my dad and grandma. then last night my step dad had a fall and seriously injured himself. I was up all night at the hospital and I’m really stressed. I’m over COVID. I’m having multiple issues at work. I don’t know what to do anymore. im on medication, I’m seeing a psychologist and my GP every week; but it’s the fact something new keeps happening.

PTSD-961,Family Trauma/Anger,"Hi, I have been dealing with severe anxiety and mild/deep depression for years now. It is undoubtedly linked to the divorce my parents got when I was about 10 (I am 22 now). It was ugly. I saw things as a child that I shouldn't have including assault, courtrooms, back of police cars, suicidal attempts by a parent. I know for certain all this has impacted me, but it has been the last few months that I have seen myself spiralling. I am constantly angry, trying to control others with minuscule tasks, snapping at them, just being plain awful. I drink more than I should, and it reached a tipping point the other night when I was wallowing in a bout of depression and got blind drunk. I had a fight with my mum, that I don't remember, and said some things that I know were disgusting toward her. We are not talking, just avoiding each other. I live with her and her husband who I really don't like. I don't talk to my brother much, as in the past I took my mums side in certain matters. My family is a mess, I don't think I've been stable since the divorce. I need to change, stop taking my anger out on others. But the loneliness and weariness is overwhelming. I simply give up and let myself wallow. Most days I feel like simply vanishing somewhere else. Start something new. But there is this hold my family has over me that guilt trips me into staying, from trying to separate myself from them. I am ashamed of myself to say the least, I simply don't want to be this way anymore.",Alice182,Community Member,11-06-2020,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/family-trauma-anger/td-p/480864

It seems to be the only way to feel ok again, to hurt him back, to feel like I have some control again. It’s not a conscious thing, i think it’s just a coping mechanism. I retreat inward emotionally yet lash out at him verbally. I feel a little bit like a caged animal. My joy and motivation in life is dissipating and I am simply here.

I will be 40 in july, expatriated from the U.S. and I love australia but it's not been good to me. I know that I have PTSD, wasn't diagnosed until I moved here in 2013 from my time in Iraq 5 years earlier. I'm pretty sure I actually have cPTSD. I've always been amazing at masking my issues or locking them away until covid19 - honestly, things have been crumbling apart a bit before christmastime this year, but really fell open when I was locked in my house. Mind you, covid19 doesn't 'scare' me, I am just doing my part to stay safe and those around me. It's being trapped inside that's the issue. Trapped inside with just my brain and it's thinking about all the things that have been traumatic in life, including things I'd had locked away or chose to forget. I feel like a fake though, almost, i had great parents that adopted me when I was 5 weeks old. i had friends, good family, all the good stuff. Then i remember the torture that school was, the physical, emotional and sexual abuse by fellow students. Inheriting abandoment issues from being adopted due to those around me making me feel that. Being physically abused and raped by a partner...losing my father at 22... joining the army and seeing war...the constant fear women have being women...constant sexual misbehavior by men in public... being constantly guilted and manipulated by a mother that can't let go at all. There is so much more, things i haven't told people, things that I have. during this covid time, my mother had a bad fall - she's 81- didn't break anything, but the guilt thrown at me made the last nerve I had break. now i'm lost. I cannot stop dwelling, wishing i had an emotion to release. CBT makes everything worse, I don't want to talk to my GP she'll try to send me back to the woman that wants to be my friend with CBT. Nurse at uni has me trying ACT but it's making it all worse. I take antidepressants for my fibromyalgia and beta blockers for my essential tremour and migraines. Maybe I need more medical intervention, I don't think I should feel this way on that medication. Maybe it's time to check in a hospital, but then I'll feel more fake because I sure don't have it that bad?

PTSD-968,Recent break up and partner's trauma,"Hi all. First time here. Everyone seems lovely. I recently experienced my first break up. My ex also disclosed his childhood trauma I never knew about. I'm devastated for him. We were best friends for years and became a couple 7 months ago. Everything was wonderful until COVID hit. We limited physical interaction since we don't live together, but spoke on the phone. One day he seemed distant. He told me that he was using isolation to go inward. He was stressed that he lost work (he's on Jopkeeper) and his share house fell apart. He assured me he loved me when asked if he was ok. He became physically affectionate again, though said it was tough time mentally. He then started avoiding intimacy. I put it down to stress, but I started taking it personally. He was negative, hinting the future was bleak. I told him that I was worried that I was making him uncomfortable when I hugged him. He said he didn't know ""how to tell me"". He enjoyed isolation, finally taking steps to heal his trauma. He told me he was sexually abused as a child. Facing his trauma, he has gone to a dark place. He told me he hates himself, breaking up with me, saying I need to expect better. He felt worried that he was going to become mean. I was shocked, as that's not the person I've known. I'm scared he fell out of love with me. He said he can't be physical with anyone at the moment and he can't associate sex with love. He says I'm important to him and he still wants to be my friend. I'm devastated we're not together. I have to accept his decision. He says he can't be a good partner without loving himself. I suspect he has PTSD? Reading about symptoms, a lot adds up. I'm wondering if COVID and associated stresses triggered? Is it possible for present stressful events to add up and create triggers of past trauma unexpectedly? Also, my first sexual experiences were with him. My comfort was his highest priority and he was VERY scared about hurting me. I believe this also triggered him. He told me he loved me too much to hurt me. He said he wasn't as stressed with previous sexual partners (they were experienced). He didn't mean that in an awful way, I just think he associated my vulnerability with himself as a child. Anybody experienced anything similar? The sudden disruption of intimacy and change in personality? I'm struggling badly. Everything was going so well for us and I'm struggling to put the pieces together.

I have said to her that I can't associate with him anymore as I have a rule that I live by, ""you only get one chance with me, I don't give people another chance to insult me"".

I’m now crying, and so overwhelmed thinking of an experience when I was 12 years old and along in the city before sunrise. I always assumed my experience did not matter as I was not physically assaulted, but I experienced such extreme fear after being crowded by a group of older men who threatened me in graphic ways.

PTSD-974,Mental Health friendship disconnection,"Hi, I’m just wondering what coping strategies others have used to maintain friendships when struggling with complex mental health? Just like many others on this site, I’ve experienced & been diagnosed with complex grief, ptsd & sever depression. The past decade has been a downhill run of unfortunate & traumatic events where I’ve only been able to function to a basic capacity. Last year this fell apart & I was seriously mentally unwell & admitted to hospital. I had some amazing friends around me, but the toll of my recovery & their struggles to understand the complexity around trauma has strained our friendships greatly. I feel that anxiety & depression are easier for others to understand & the path to recovery can be more obvious. Trauma is so complex. Some of the trauma I’m trying to work through is surrounding my fathers self inflicted death & abandonment due to a number of factors. The simplest of things trigger my ptsd & to others it would appear like overanalysing a situation, but its so real and raw to me. I have a wonderful GP, psychologist, psychiatrist; but the social disconnection is incredibly difficult. Trust is so difficult for me, the expectations from others for me to let my guard down feels rushed & intrusive. I can’t seem to manage letting others in, building trust & protecting myself in a healthy & balanced way. I either shut myself off, or open up to others & trigger feelings of fear, paranoia and panic. I’ve been working on “small disclosures” as a way to bridge this path, but that doesn’t seem to be enough for others. This year, the emotional overwhelm of the previous 12months, pressure from those around me to progress faster in my recovery and a trigger; sent me spiralling into psychosis. My medical team were fantastic, but I was extremely paranoid of my relationships & I quite irrationally disconnected myself; hurting & confusing those closest to me. None seems willing to discuss the matter or accept any sort of apology. We all seem exhausted & broken from the past year; this carries so much guilt on my behalf. I can’t help but feel worthless and incapable of maintaining relationships. The desire to forge new friendships is non-existent. I know my recovery is hard for others to understand, but it’s hard to be the person managing this & working so hard to make the progress I need. Relationships used to be so easy for me, but now I feel completely socially inept now. Does anyone else feel this way?

PTSD-975,Back @ Work After COVID Iso + Intrusive thoughts,"Hi everyone, Newbie here & I thought I'd test the waters by making a first post to get things off my chest before I dive into the BB cafe or something else social. I'm 30, single & live at home. I do have a supportive network around me & I do realise that I am extremely lucky to be where I am. I do however have undiagnosed PTSD & severe anxiety. I battled with mental health as a teen & have had many successes & fails so far. Though in 2016, I witnessed the physical aftermath of my father's death in a light plane crash. After that, I did see & speak to a few professionals but mainly got by with the wonderful support of my family & sheer willpower using meditation as my main means of getting by. It has plagued me ever since (flashbacks, intrusive thoughts etc). It has crept into almost every aspect of my life & at times, I find myself physically shut down to the world - I make all my life choices based on how bad or good my anxiety & PTSD is. The big factors in my life are: I have severe anxiety driving at high speeds, driving generally & driving with people in the car, driving at night, when I'm in unfamiliar environments, speaking to relatively small groups & in moderately stressful situations. Flash forward to now, COVID has made my life a rollercoaster. At first, I was anxious about it. I am asthmatic & catch the flu easily. Then, I was oddly calm. I'd prepared for the worst in my mind & I knew I'd be able to accept anything that came my way because I'd done the mental work. Death could come swiftly. THEN, I was laid off work for over a month. It would be temporary but when I was told there was no more work, I didn't know for how long. I made huge steps to be productive at home & with my mental & physical health. I felt amazing for that period. Now that I am back at work, I feel incredibly underprepared. I miss those good feelings I had when I was on top of both of my mental & physical health. Things I had planned to do now feel too difficult to do & feel bad for it. I feel underproductive even though I am working hard on all the aspects of my life admin. Currently, I am struggling with the return of a *lovely* symptom PSTD/anxiety... intrusive thoughts. Some of which disturb me so greatly, I cry for hours & feel physically ill. I feel like a sick, twisted person for thinking some of these things but I know that I would never, ever act on any of them. Does anyone have any tips for alleviating them? Distraction can only do so much. Thanks guys. - MH x",mandatory.happiness,Community Member,31-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/back-work-after-covid-iso-intrusive-thoughts/td-p/467752

PTSD-977,My shrink says I dissociated and I think I might have PTSD.,"I think my past is affecting my present and that I might have PTSD. In my late teen years I had a friend in school who was terribly unwell and suicidal. In her distress she did many violent things to herself including multiple suicide attempts; I often went to school not knowing if she would be alive and spent a lot of my time trying to keep her around. In 2018 she died of suicide while in a psychiatric hospital. She was then brain dead for three weeks; it was a very prolonged and painful event. I didn't really have a relationship to her as an adult, so that time was the strangest limbo-grieving the past in the present; of finally being 'allowed' to grieve, I guess. I saw a good shrink, I graduated from a degree, I spent 2019 collecting myself. Fast forward to now. I went back to study post grad journalism, but soon dropped out. I was already unemployed when the pandemic hit, and I struggled to cope with the anxiety of the 24 hour newsreel alone in my house. I was vomiting from anxiety. Couldn't concentrate. I got a job at a supermarket shortly after the first restrictions and layoffs were announced. I was grateful but still anxious, as one of my housemates has early onset Parkinsons' disease, and I couldn't live with myself if I gave her corona. One evening, without realising what I was doing, I cut big chunks out of my hair. I had to go to the barber to get it fixed with a number one shave, at a time when it felt irresponsible even to go outside. So I moved back to the folks and felt better. A month later, I told my therapist about the hair cutting incident and they were immediately concerned. I couldn't understand why they were worried for me, since I was feeling better. They told me they think I dissociated while cutting my hair; they know me to be quite a conscientious, measured person, and it was out of character for me. Since then I've spent excessive time questioning my sanity and trying to think of other times I might have dissociated, and does this mean that what I thought was garden variety anxiety might actually be something else. I'm okay. But I'm a 25 year old woman, washed up living at my parents, working minimum wage, and don't really know what else I want to be doing. My bachelor degree is in creative writing. I don't know how I feel about writing. It used to be my passion and now I find it very hard to put myself out into the world. I think I'm too sensitive for journalism. I'm okay but lost. At least the world is adrift with me.",fyrefly,Community Member,08-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-shrink-says-i-dissociated-and-i-think-i-might-have-ptsd/td-p/478183
PTSD-978,Anxiety post home invasion,"In march 2019 mine and my partners home was invaded whilst I was home alone. It happened at 2am, there was 4 men inside and I was on the phone to 000, my partner is defence and therefore was away for work (goes away very often). It took the police 25 minutes to arrive at my house although I live 5 minutes from the police station. I had a man walking up and down my hallway continuously whilst the rest of them destroyed our home. I was holding my door handle locked. They stole our car as they left. The police arrived 5 minutes later. They only caught one person responsible for the crime and he said to police that he was not sorry and that if they hadn't of known police were on the way they would have come for me next. He admitted to the police about them watching the house for a week prior. the police investigation is still in court and I still to this day do not know what they look like, however they know what I look like, they are also free to walk on the streets and we live in a small town so very easily I could pass by them. They entered the property by removing my side doors from the rollers, its also presumed it was the same people who came back about a month ago and broke in through our garage roller door however they fled when I opened the door to the garage yelling that I was on the phone to police and I was armed with a weapon. Since all of this I cannot sleep, whenever I am home alone and this is often. I recently spent an entire month sleeping on couches of friends whilst my partner worked away. I was offered 3 counselling sessions when the original break in happened. I accepted however the counsellor didn't at all seem interested and he left our sitting early and then did not show for our next, since then I feel although its hopeless to see a councillor. I have moved furniture around in the house, I have now got security cameras that record motion, I ensure all glass doors are locked and windows are closed with curtains also drawn. I take my handbag and keys to bed. I still cannot sleep, I find myself dozing however my heart continues to race and it feels like I can't swallow. we have tried to move house but the only houses available to us through defence are in the same suburb which is being hit with bad crime and they will not allow us to move elsewhere. I feel even more trapped and my partner is due to leave for another month very soon. pls someone help me.",sunflowergirl27,Community Member,28-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/anxiety-post-home-invasion/td-p/454472

PTSD-980,SUPRESSED CHILDHOOD TRAUMA?,"Hey, i don’t have a question but just reaching out. i have been struggling with depression(suicidal thoughts), anxiety(with panic attacks), an eating disorder(anorexia,bulimia), low self esteem with feelings of disgust, guilt, and greed, as well as mood swings, self harm and urges to escape/disappear/runaway. have recently been wondering if I have some sort of supressed childhood trauma as I struggle to find the source of much of this and remember having some of these thoughts from a very young age?? My family life is good and I cannot recall any traumatic instances however this may be due to memory blank? this may sound gross/weird although I have also had strange sexual desires regarding older men, incest, persons of authority (e.g.teachers), and rather violent rape from a questionably young age (11 is the earliest I remember), plus a few small slightly sexual actions as a kid (although this may be overthinking it). I also have a lot of trouble with my sense of self (often feel no connection to my name, feel as if I am staring at a stanger when looking at childhood photos, often feel a need to change who I am and select a persona of some sort), sometimes I also seem to almost leave my body/the world and feel as if I am viewing everything through a screen, also when I was younger I had moments where I seemed to not believe that I wasnt actually the child of my parents(photos prove I am), even thinking I was an alien at one point(I was a kid).

PTSD-982,Emotional Abuse at home,"I’m a proud father of two kids and a wife of over 18 years. I love my family so much and would do anything for them. I’ve struggled with mental health my whole life, I feel like my childhood was shitty and I can’t pinpoint why no matter how hard I think. My dad was an alcoholic who gambled a lot and had lots of ups and downs but I still can’t say why I was so messed up as a kid. Me and my SO got together young and almost obsessed about eachother for years, I did have OCD so I guess I felt ok with that. Fast forward then we had our kids and suddenly my partner became even more important which made me scared to lose her, I would worry and obsess when she went out and worry she was going to cheat, I would accuse her of cheating with any male that was close to her including family and friends. My ocd would kick in and I became obsessed with it all and began to try to control it by reading her private phone and reading her messages and everything else. I then began to stop her from going out, having friends. If she was at home with me I had control. This has been going on for over 10 years. We’re almost about to break up. I am an emotional abuser... She is even scared to go to buy food without me. In trapping her in this toxic relationship for so long I have made her a prisoner. As much as she is a prisoner I am too. To my mental health. I know that this isn’t the real me but have been scared to get true help. In my heart I know she is a good person and I trust her but my ocd or mental health questions things that I should never. I want trust back, I want my life back, I want her to be proud of me and I want us both to be free, whatever it takes. I’m ready to change and looking for a mental health facility that can take me for a couple of weeks so I may begin to repair myself. I’d prefer the holistic approach as I am weary of drugs/antidepressants. Happy to hear any input, even if you want to tell me what an idiot I am, I deserve it. I have called her every thing under the sun and treated her so bad, now even my young son is picking up on the negativity. I want to change for my kids and her and myself too. Please share input, happy to answer questions whether you have done what I’ve done or even if you are abused and want to ask me what you can’t ask your partner who may be an abuser too.",Changeit1114,Community Member,18-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/emotional-abuse-at-home/td-p/436263

PTSD-984, Undiagnosed PTSD ...,"Hi everyone I'm posting here because I've never really told anyone this before, but I think I might have undiagnosed PTSD. It all stems from a workplace I was briefly in 2yrs ago. I got there after 4yrs of studying to qualify for the job, but when I got there, the job was not as advertised. I only had 1hr of client contact per fortnight and was given tasks such as going out to buy toilet paper. I was surrounded by colleagues who constantly had a go at me about the fact that they were too busy. I started to feel depressed. Managers told me I was depressed because I had moved away from my friends. They therefore said I had no insight into my condition When my so called supervisor, who was in a different town and didn't provide me with a single session of supervision, found out that I have a bipolar diagnosis, he decided that months ago when we met I had been manic (which I wasn't). He hadn't thought to mention anything about this at the tim After that I was bullied, and treated like crap. I ended up in hospital 3 times in 4 months, including a suicide attempt. I was not allowed to do anything at work and was accused of multiple disciplinary failures which were fabricated by managers. I was banned from speaking to anyone at work and was told i was not allowed to meet coworkers for coffee outside of work. I was required to act as a receptionist making bookings for coworkers who did not keep their calendars updated and was then berated when I accidentally double booked people. When I left, I found out that the 'supervisor' had reported me to the board saying I had no insight into my condition. Despite my psychiatrist and GP and the boards own psychiatrist all agreeing that my issue was situational and I was fine to work, I still ended up with conditions being enforced that stopped me from working for 2 years. Since leaving that workplace, my mental health has been much better and I have not been back to hospital. I am now allowed to practice again and am just about to start what sounds like a dream job. However the anxiety that this situation might happen again is very high, and I feel like I can't talk to my new workplace about the situation because I found out in the last job that I cannot tell employers about my diagnosis. I still feel like crap every day because of the 2yrs I've just wasted and the injustice of what went on in that workplace, Sorry for the rant!",Tillysmum,Blue Voices Member,23-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/undiagnosed-ptsd/td-p/443117
PTSD-985,Seeking a diagnosis for CPTSD (or complex trauma),"Hi there This is my first post, so I apologize if I somehow get this wrong. I think I may have CPTSD or complex trauma and I was wondering how one might go about getting a diagnosis (since its not in the DSM-V)? I know you shouldn't self diagnose, but nothing else seems to fit or feel right. I know symptomatically CPTSD is quite varied but I recently started reading Jonice Webb's book on childhood emotional neglect and Pete Walker's website on CPTSD and a lot of my wildly varied behaviours suddenly seem to make some sort of sense. I started down this path as my new psychologist started delving into my childhood and since then I've been doing a lot of reflecting and reading. I think I've spent most of my life using various coping mechanisms just to get by which might explain why I feel like I've spent my entire life floating or living day to day. Why I've said or done certain things that have hurt people close to me. I tried CBT with my first psychologist, but it all felt too superficial. Like using tape to cover the cracks instead of finding the source of the problem and putting in structural supports in. I also realised some months in that I had started to say what I thought she wanted to hear, because I was afraid of letting her down (I know, its a bit ironic). I'm grateful my new psychologist has decided to delve into my past, but I really want to hit the ground running this time instead of just skipping along the surface which is why I thought a diagnosis might help.",morethancake,Community Member,21-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/seeking-a-diagnosis-for-cptsd-or-complex-trauma/td-p/441045

PTSD-987,Bushfire trauma being bought up again,"So I know this may be hard for people as well, but I just need to talk. So christmas/new year, I was with my parents and brother at the holiday home in the Snowy Mountains. My dad said to leave my car at home in Sydney and we will all travel in one car. So we did, then the bushfires started, New Years Eve and New Years Day we were on emergency ember attack alert. Jan 2, after hearing that the fires were coming and knowing that my parents had to drive me over to canberra to pick up the CountryLink back to Sydney in a couple of days time, I made the decision to leave on. The last bus out. My parents and brother stayed behind. At the time, my parents were saying that it was like I was running scared, but I just had this feeling that they might not get back after taking me the 200kms one way to meet the train. So staying at a friends house for 2 days until my train back to Sydney, I was there while the firestorm hit the town, reports were coming in that places were lost, the town was surrounded by fire and everyone had been evaluated to the safest spot. I have never been so scared in my life. My parents were obviously traumatised by the incident, but I felt that they didn’t understand that I was deeply traumatised too. I felt so guilty for leaving. I should have stayed. all was fine until today when they said about regional travel again and my parents said that if safe we will go down for the longweekend next month. I haven’t been back since fleeing from the fires and now all that trauma of feeling guilty about leaving and being selfish that I left have just come back up and I just feel so down and can’t stop crying. I can see that I am still traumatised and still wish that I had stayed.

PTSD-988,Have I created my own 'echo chamber'?,"Hi everyone I hope you're doing well today. I have talked with only 2 of my friends since deciding to get more tailored psychological help from a Specialist Trauma Psychologist. That's a lot more than I usually speak to friends in a week. Anyway they are a little bewildered, confused and are questioning whether the feedback from probably 6 psychologists and counsellors is a definite on a PSTD / C-PTSD diagnosis. In fact one psych said ""it's a no brainer really, it's more like how could you NOT have PTSD after such events""... My friends are more or less saying that they think I'm okay. One session will probably be all I need etc.. Regardless of what any friends think, I am still resolved to follow this path of psych support. I know it will be a long time getting such support and more probably. After reflecting on my friend's lives, and they have not been easy by any stretch... they have suffered their own quite severe traumas, I am wondering if I had just created my own 'echo chamber'? Meaning that now I only have friends who have experienced severe trauma themselves. ATM none of my friends are in counselling and most have never had any. I 'know' other people who may call me a 'friend' but I'll call them acquaintances as I have not leaned on them in tough times, or they with me much. I put distance between these people and myself. All of my close friends are quite closed off socially. They don't associate with each other. I talk very openly with these friends and they with me. I wonder whether part of my denial having PTSD and seeking further treatment has been because of my choice of friends to a certain degree? They think my behaviours are quite normal or 'to be expected' etc. I'm not blaming them at all. I love them dearly. I'm not sure what to think about it all... Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

PTSD-989,I'm so disillusioned by life,"Everything that I held dear to me, everything that I believed in is wrong, is gone or nearly gone. My life has been effected traumatically by other peoples decisions and I'm no longer in control. Should I really care? I don't know anymore. Nobody cared about me when they made their decisions, withholding the truth about things, even lied to stop me from finding out or being found out themselves. The ripple effect of some thoughtless, selfish person, only out for themselves makes a decision to destroy someone else's life. How this poor sole reacts, which in some instances, not all, is only human nature, may, in turn devastate and cripple someone else, and so forth. No-one would actually believe that my life has happened if I sat down and told you everything. Days of our lives would be a dull substitute.

PTSD-991,"Sex abuse, HIV and stigma",I was diagnosed with HIV after reporting sexual abuse to my gp. He tested me and it came back positive. At that point in time I didnt process any of it not the rexual abuse not my own diagnosis becuase I had three cbildren to look after one of which I had been breastfeeding. When my baby came back positive as well the focus was on getting my baby treatment and I didnt have time to process how I felt about giving my child HIV. It has been four years now my child is well and healthy we have been through alot with liquid medication treatment and he is now on tablets and doing well. We have both been undetectable from medication since starting which means the virus is doormat and we cant transmit it but I have had alot of symptoms from my own meds. I have nausea fatigue and weight gain and for the longest time I have been pushing past it and been busy raising my kids and studying. In the last six months my symptoms have peristed and with other health issues I have gotten to the point where doing anything takes the biggest toll on me. When the kids fight and yell I have panic attacks. I find that no matter what I do and say they wont stop. I get it they are kids and it is normal but I feel the way it affects me isnt. I started to see the links of PTSD and trauma but I have not gotten help. I am to embaressed to tell anyone. I feel now I have deep depression from living unwell for so long and now with the kids home all the time due to the pandemic I am not coping. I am not getting enough sleep and I am woken up every morning early from the kids. I have tried to explain what I am going through to my mum and she does not get it she just blames me. This morning she told me I am not that sick that I cant be doing more than I am now and expects me to just stop being depressed she said its a choice. I dont have any other support I dont want a partner after the sexual abuse I experienced so I have been on my own all this time. I dont know what to do to change this I am normally a positive person who pushes past whatever I am going through but I cant anymore. I dont like going out with the kids they always touch surfaces and cant abide by social distancing rules. I am scared someone will yell at us or worse we will get in trouble. My mum is my only support and it really sucks that she does not get it and blames me all the time. I just need help and I am way past helping myself.,Warrierdown25,Community Member,19-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sex-abuse-hiv-and-stigma/td-p/436585
PTSD-992,PTSD diagnosis - what next?,"Had a zoom call with my psychiatrist today. I mentioned that my psychologist thought I had symptoms of PTSD & he said he thinks the same thing & that is affecting my emotions & behaviours. He did tell me he thinks I am improving, he told me today when he first met me he was really worried & thought I needed to go to hospital. So I guess if he notices a change there must be one. So why do I feel so down & depressed all the time? Like every day. He wants to speak with me again in a months time. So now I’m lost & confused. What do I do about the PTSD? Do I just work on this with the psychologist or should the psychiatrist be helping me with this? I speak with my psychologist once a week so my appointments with her are much more regular. I don’t know anything about PTSD or how to deal with it. i am on 2 types of medication for my mental health issues but is there more I should be doing or trying or talking about with him?

PTSD-993,Feeling totally lost,"All my life I have struggled with my parents being emotionally abusive and on a few occasions physically abusive. I also feel like I have been sexually abused in my childhood but have trouble remembering. This has caused me a lot of pain and suffering in my own head. As I grow older I fear more and more that I won't be able to shake these blues (joke). I avoid female friendships and struggle when I am in them. I feel like I attract a lot of negativity and it's all my fault, everything bad in my life is on me. I deserve it because I'm a bad person. I'm always on the look out for the next worst thing. I'm trying to keep reminding myself that I shouldn't beat myself up to much. I haven't really known a world any different. Things are hard right now and I can't shake jealous feelings I have and social anxiety. I guess I just wanted to vent because I'm feeling that burn out feeling. I'm trying so hard to be healthy and sometimes it just seems impossible. I feel guilty if I start to feel a little bit better. Ugh haha I hope everyone is feeling a little bit better than I am lol and is doin well",VictoriaI,Community Member,10-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/feeling-totally-lost/td-p/479197
PTSD-994,Not alone podcast,"Hi, I just listened to the BB podcasts - not alone and I just thought they were brilliant. I don't work in any of the emergency services but really related to a lot of what was said in the overcoming trauma one. (I suffer with PTSD) I can't count the times I have turned up to work and just sat and looked at my computer, knowing I had to do something with it but just not being able to join the dots to turn it on. Also, turning up to therapy and just ticking the box, yep I've done therapy but not really properly ""attending"" therapy and participating fully. In 'supporting a loved one', I really related to when they talked about listening to music and knowing how someone was doing depending on the music they were playing. When i get low I can easily lock myself away and play the same song on repeat for a good week if the words are speaking to me. I found it really helpful to hear story's from other people, it helps to know that others can feel what your feeling too and that we arnt in this alone. If you haven't checked them out yet, I would defiantly recommend them. Looking forward to the next episode. Great work BB!

PTSD-995,Trapped,"I’ve been in an abusive relationship for 15 years. Have stuck it out while he goes through various counsellors. We have periods of good times but it always ends up the same- alcohol followed by verbal & physical abuse. I finally called the police last week but they were hopeless. I’ll never ring them again. I found the guts to tell him I want out of the marriage & this toxic, endless cycle but he’s still claiming he can “fix” this. He won’t leave or accept my decision. He says I can leave but not the kids. I am scared, depressed & feeling low & helpless.

PTSD-996,Lost after trauma,"I am 55 years old all my adult life I was over weight due to lack of self love , respect, discipline. Finally in the best place emotionally in my life I decided to have weight loss surgery. I was doing well. I was eating healthy and the first time in my life was loving exercise. In 18 months I had dropped 30kg and was full of vitality and life. 5 days a week I rode to my 7am Pilates class, and yoga twice a week. I had NEVER felt so strong, content. Finally I was free from emotional physical and weight pain. Hubby of 30 years was loving this happy full of energy wife. I even did HBF run for a reason 2019. OMG I was so proud of me. Never had I felt like that. November 2019 Life was beautiful. I felt beautiful content. Then 30/11/19 7:15 pm riding my bike with hubby I fell off. I suffered major facial injuries. I was rushed by ambulance to RPH trauma unit spent 8 days there. I also suffered major injuries to my arm. I was operated on my arm was plated and I have a new elbow joint. Good news was I had no head or neck injury. My poor face was unrecognisable. The doctor told me I was lucky I had been wearing my helmet or I would have been dead. But what he didn’t know is some thing did die the night of 30/11/19 ME. Fast forward to 15/05/2020. It’s two years today since I had my weight loss surgery and I can not straighten or bend my arm I can not touch my face do hair pull up knickers do up bra drive a car. I can’t sleep I hurt 24/7 I dread going to bed. I sleep sitting coz my eye rolls back and I have trouble opening It mornings. I wear a huge splint on my arm to bed. I have no strength in my arm. I am so frighten to fall. I am so angry frustrated I hate my life. I do not feel any joy I am filled with an overwhelming sense of loss. Every day open my eyes in the morning and feel pain, back hurts from my sleeping position my arm and face hurts I get out of bed like a old lady. I shuffle to the loo. Eventually my eye opens, slowly my body give its very best shot at trying to remember its only 55. I have learnt the art of the silent cry I cry most days all day for what I have lost. I cry because I wished I never knew how good life could be how strong and desirable I could feel. how much I loved my Pilates yoga and how much I would love to ride my bike.It’s all gone now I feel so hopeless, alone no one understands. I am slipping through the cracks. On my bad days I wish I had died on that path.

PTSD-998,Moving on without acknowledgement or apology from abusers,"Hey all I got diagnosed with CPTSD around 2 years ago, I've been seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist and have improved a lot with treatment. I've noticed a bit of a stumbling block recently though. No one involved in my abuse, particularly family, have ever acknowledged or apologised for anything. Whenever incidents come up in conversation, I'm shut down, told it didn't happen or I'm remembering wrong or they don't remember it so they can't apologise for it. I'm finding it really difficult to cope with. My psychologist has suggested I stop communicating with my family, potentially forever. I'm already estranged from my father (from childhood), one of my sisters for around 5 years, my other sister about a month ago so I'm really only left with my mum, brother and half-brother. I'm not close to my half-brother but want to develop that relationship and he's not been involved in any of this so there's no problem there. My older brother bullied me through childhood which he's not acknowledged or apologised for but I think he'd be the most likely to. So I think the real issue is with my mother. I think if I stopped speaking to her she'd be upset and genuinely confused, I don't think she understands anything that's gone on in my family, she just downplays everything, laughs it off or insists she ""doesn't remember it like that"". She rewrites history, even in small ways that make no sense to do, the lies don't actually add anything or make her look any better but she seems to think they do. Having it all minimised is very upsetting and is making it hard to maintain a relationship. I don't know what to do really. Have any of you confronted people and had a positive outcome? I don't see one being possible here but I'd love to be wrong, honestly.

PTSD-1000,i dont know my purpose,"Throughout high school, I was a very high achiever and always trying my best to apply myself and help others around me. I was in the debate team, school vice-captain etc. I've always been more than happy to do things for others, it gave me purpose and made me feel appreciated. I also really liked that it made me look like a good person, as I'm very sensitive to the way people around me perceive me. Which obviously is not a great way to live. Its caused me to develop ed in the past. However my last 2 years of high school I had struggled to apply myself and find any motivation to study or do well. I was only motivated to participate in activities that would benefit the people around me. Things that were easy and fun. Long story short I didn't do well in my hsc. Earlier in the year, my careers advisor had told me that a bachelor of communications would be perfect as I had made many promotional videos for the school and videos about things like raising awareness for violence against women. I got into the course, and happy to do so because she had told me I was good at it and she could tell I enjoyed it. In March I started my course and I quickly realised how uninterested and unmotivated I am. I don't care about studying and I'm too scared to admit that to my parents because they are strict and have always expected a lot from me. I don't know what to do because I'm failing my degree and I've just realised that I don't even know what I truly want to do. I don't have any talents or interests in anything except for anime and manga which is a hobby. I've lived my life going off what people told me they wanted or expected from me and now I'm in the real world and I have to live by what I want, except I don't know what to do. I can't imagine myself doing anything in the future, I lose interest in things quickly and give up if I'm not good at the 1st attempt. I'm thinking about dropping out to stay at home so I can care for my grandmother like I have been for the last 3 years. I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I'm being selfish and lazy. I'm starting to have bad thoughts that I haven't had for a long time. I have to make a statement in court that's 3 weeks away, someone had sexually assaulted me while I was a minor. I've just been really unhappy.

PTSD-1002,Anxiety due to Covid 19 and I've used all my sessions on my Mental Health Plan,"Hi, My PTSD was triggered several months ago. As a consequence of this my anxiety level has been through the roof. At the beginning of this year I started seeing my psychologist weekly, as I didn't feel safe. Consequently I used up my mental health plan fairly quickly. Finances are really tight at the moment, so my therapist has given me a reduction in my fee which I am grateful for but also feel bad about. I've always paid my own way. In the midst of this the Covid 19 isolation happened. The stress it has caused me is enormous. I'm coping with the isolation, it's the financial side of things that is worrying me. That and the fact that one of my children is a teacher. I have lost a child and I am constantly frightened of losing my remaining child. With recent talks of lifting restrictions, my anxiety went through the roof again. I just wish this pandemic would end. In relation to the mental health plan, when the Govt initially announced funding for telehealth psychology appointments, I was hopeful they would extend the sessions on a plan. I totally understand that the pandemic will trigger mental health issues for people who may never have had them in the past. But I feel like for those of us already dealing with issues.... well I know Covid 19 has pushed me to the edge. Sorry for venting, I'm just feeling very frustrated and anxious at the minute. It has taken me years to be able to confront my past, and due to my financial situation, I have had push out my sessions. I know I'm not the only one feeling it at the moment. I also know that there are many more worse off. I just needed to vent what's in my head, in the vain hope I might get some sleep tonight.

PTSD-1003,Does your home reflect your state of mind?,"Hi guys I'm pretty sure my house is reflecting my state of mind. It's getting worse and worse and worse. I just feel exhausted over trying to manage it all. I wish I could press pause on all that stuff, start my PTSD therapy and then re-open sectors with tasks I think I can manage. What a great thing that would be. Does anyone else feel like their house is / has gone downhill? Are you managing better? If so what helped? My parents separated but I know they were both hoarders. My step mother kept a 'neat ship' lol so she put ALL my dad's stuff under the house to degrade with weather. He passed away years ago. I have a small bag she sent me of his memorabilia, she kept the awesome stuff lol! My mother is obviously a hoarder (No Contact with mother for decades) and she can't live in her house now. I know I have hoarding tendencies, it's truly a fight with these tendencies every minute if I'm up for the fight. I finally sorted through my g-grandmothers things this year, she passed a long time ago. That was sweet, joyful and difficult and I cried quite a bit. I threw lots in the trash! I disseminated some, filed some, we use some. But I have ex husbands things, not all ofcourse, just what that creature left. I found AWESOME power tools but have a weird association with them. Due to the DV, reporting, Courts, it's a triggering experience finding anything of his let alone deciding to GO THROUGH his stuff. Plus I need to talk to the kids about what they may want and I don't want to trigger them, so I put that off big time. Plus he destroyed and stole and threw out a lot of my precious thing, so venturing into those spaces leads to high emotions. And my garden but that is more manageable since I employed a cheerful, gnome like man to help me at times. Big step for me but he is good. It's like a sad archaeological dig site and far better with someone toiling with me. I find toys and things from happier times but the garden was neglected as I fought in Courts for years. It's a 'STATE' ughhh. Thankyou for letting me vent. If you can help, that would be awesome.

PTSD-1004,"Advice please?? Overwhelmed, anxious and feeling lost is my permanent state of mind lately","I'm not really sure where to post but I am really hoping for some advice. ve been on anxiety and depression medication for around 5 years now and have experienced anxiety, depression, and PTSD my entire life after experiencing quite a traumatic and neglectful childhood and some of my teenage years being homeless. I don't really have any friends due to moving around a lot and constant upheaval of my life repeatedly over the last 10-12 years. I don't really have a family either. I tend to keep to myself and am scared of pretty much everything and anything. I'm 27 years old and I have a very reliant fiance, 2 stepdaughters who come on weekends (they live with their birth mother, during the week), a very stressful full-time job, and to top it all off I am also studying a bachelor degree online. y partner is heavily reliant on me - I have to drive him and his kids around, and although we get paid virtually the same ammount, I always end up paying for the majority of our living expenses. am that person who is literally expected to do everything for everyone, and not only do my efforts go unacknowledge and unappreciated, but when I need time or money or ANYTHING for myself, it is deemed totally unacceptable. I recently had to start seeing a new psychologist and gosh, it felt horrible having to recount everything and basically start all over again. These past 4 months I have experienced a serious decline in my mental health, my mood, my approach to life. I just don't feel like me, it feels like all the life has been sucked out of me and I just can't do it anymore. I have nothing left to give. have spoken to my partner because my hope for next year is to drop some days at work so instead of working a 40+ hour working week, I would work part-time and have more time for myself and to study. He flat out said no and told me if i only want to work a few days a week I should move back in with my parents (knowing full well I have been unable to live with my family since they kicked me out of home when I was 15 years old) I am not prepared to give up my studies because I am only studying part-time at the moment and I have been putting off completing my degree since I graduated high school in 2010 due to the need to be able to support myself (and everyone else!) financially. what should I do?",loouuiiee,Blue Voices Member,02-12-2019,PTSD and trauma,28,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/advice-please-overwhelmed-anxious-and-feeling-lost-is-my/td-p/492531

My abuse ended four years ago but it haunts me every day. I still work in the same industry, although at a different organisation. I was mostly verbally abused but occasionally the abuse was physical. Hair pulling, pushing into doors, arm pinching, kicking shins. On a few occasions it got out of control but I don't like to talk about those. I think it went on for about 9 months. The man was my direct supervisor though he wasn't the head of the office. I never told anyone at the time. I've only told my psychiatrist now, and that was about 12 months ago. I have PTSD and pretty bad anxiety. I don't like men being close to me. I don't like being touched. I hate people being behind me where I can't see them. I don't like the quiet because that's when i didn't know where he was. My treatment did help but it's up and down at the moment. I'd love to hear from anyone else who has experienced the same thing. I feel pretty alone.

PTSD-1006,C-PTSD diagnosis pending - unsure how I feel about it,"Dear BBers It looks like the diagnosis of C-PTSD will be made official pretty soon for me. I was diagnosed 'off-the-books' with it by a Head Psychologist about 2-3 years ago. I know the reasons they did that and I thank them for it. I attend Counselling weekly or less depending on my 'state' I will call it. I have improved but now I am stuck. I have had all day to think about the diagnosis and what it means. It's made it all real now. Before I could pretend perhaps. To the recent psychologists I spoke with, it was a no brainer lol. Black and white comment there. No grey areas I can fiddle with lol. A close friend, who is a psychologist also lol and known me for 30y, gently suggested a few weeks ago that I really needed a tailored, specialist PTSD therapy. That counselling was not enough. Also that there was some evidence that I was dissociating. She was terrified that I could become worse. Later I told said friend that I had begun using the language I speak with, to re-integrate myself and attend to my 'inner child' so to speak. That was met with silence. I also said that I would search for a therapist who specialised in trauma and PTSD, then she sounded a sigh of relief lol. She is SO HAPPY today. eye roll lol. I have a list of specialist psychs now and will start 'interviewing' them, that was the suggestion! There may be long wait lists too. I promise myself that I will take the first appointment with chosen one and I will MAKE a choice. I cried when it was kindly said to me today, again. I really don't want to have the label that so many other valiant and brave trauma survivors have. I feel like I'm being rude, greedy, arrogant IDK, just insulting to them. I want them to have everything they could possibly need, all the time. If I could just hide away and keep myself safe then I can evaporate from that PTSD scene.. But I can't. It's beyond manageable now. I want to get better. I want that for my children, my beautiful faithful friends and myself. The myself is hard to say. My pets is even easier lol. I'm really scared. I'm scared to tell a psych everything. It's so much. It's entirely unbelievable. But it all happened, so it is what it is.

PTSD-1007,Coping during relapse of mental health issues,"Hi everyone, this is my first attempt at joining a forum. Really I need somewhere to share .. I cannot function. My head is a fog. I have been through too much. Years of psychological trauma and physical pain. A struggle to find work and to become capable of doing it. The effort to function in any way that could be considered normal leaves me exhausted. I’ve tried my best to be a good mum through all of it. I know at times I have failed. The guilt of this is overpowering. In two years I’ve had to go back to my parents as I could not afford to keep a roof over my own head to trying once again to rent and take care of myself and my daughter. No matter what I do I irritate and upset her. I ask her if she’s ok... try and have conversations and I’m told not now or I’m sleeping or I’m just not interested in talking about that. I clean, pay the bills, shop, do the washing, help with her dog. I share my day or my concerns to try to build a relationship and I’m accused of overloading on her. Twice now she has lost it at me to the point I have snapped emotionally. I’m currently living at my other daughters as I’m no longer welcome in my own home. There is no concern from her towards the impact this has had. Only recriminations and blocking all contact. A process I am sure is to punish me. I cannot cope with her vitriol and anger. In that I am sure I’m completely normal however I am not normal. I have bipolar disorder. I have PTSD. I have survived years of gas lighting and lack of emotional validation that has left me questioning just who I really am. And now I feel trapped into an environment where this time the abuse comes from my own child. Am I really such a bad person that this is deserved. I honestly don’t even know what I did in the weeks leading up to this incident that made her feel so angry towards me. And yet I’m desperately trying to stop myself from reaching out and trying to resolve things. To do what I used to do and take responsibility on me and apologise... even when I know the problem is not me it’s her. I’m homeless again. Not because I don’t have a roof over my head. I’m fortunate to have my daughter and my parents who’ll take me in. But it’s not my home. It’s not the family home I spent 20 years of my life to build. There is no security or sense of achievement. If I had grandkids I’d have nowhere to invite them too. No family home. And no hope of making one. Life just feels so hopeless. I know I need help. But I can’t afford to lose my job.",Lady_of_Shallot,Community Member,24-04-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/coping-during-relapse-of-mental-health-issues/td-p/501757
PTSD-1008,Is there a grey area for consent?,"This is my first post and I’d like to thank you for reading and any light you can shed would be most helpful. After some health issues I came to realise and understand that my first sexual experience might not have been fully consensual. I don’t want to say I was raped but I question just how much was actually consensual. I was dating this guy who knew I was a virgin and the reason behind me wanting to wait. We were fooling around and it got too intense so I told him I wasn’t ready and that we wouldn’t be having sex any time soon, which he accepted. Two days later when we were fooling around he succeeded. I never said no or told him to stop or anything at all. I just remember laying there and feeling very empty and having all my feelings for him dissipate. It was almost an out of body experience. The relationship didn’t work out for many reasons other than not being able to regain feelings. I regretted allowing him to treat me so poorly but I just accepted the decisions I made while I was with him including him being my first. Fast forward to the beginning of this year and I had a lot of health issues that made me be completely honest with myself. I finally saw everything that happened in a clearer way. I thought by brushing it off and fully taking responsibility of my actions I was doing right by me but now I feel that he groomed me and it felt almost like a mentally abusive relationship. I’m currently in a lot of physical pain and on a lot of pain medications but it’s this realisation that hurts me the most. I don’t know how to feel about what happened. I don’t hate him and don’t have any animosity towards him. I don’t think of him much at all just the actual act itself. Is silence considered consent? I feel like he took advantaged of my trust but I think to him I was fully consenting to the act. I blocked it from my memory and I tried to write another narrative that showed I had the control but I don’t think I ever did. It was something I told myself to sleep better at night. The hardest part for me is not understanding the situation. I’m not even sure if I consented because I didn’t know it was happening and how does one consent to something they’re not aware of? I wish you are all doing well and staying safe during such hard times. Xoxo.",Somez,Community Member,05-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/is-there-a-grey-area-for-consent/td-p/470289
PTSD-1009,PTSD Depression and no support from my employer,"Hi, This is my first time posting and I’m hoping that someone can give me advice. I was a victim of an aggravated burglary in my own home and as a result I not only suffered physical but also mental injuries. I suffer from severe PTSD, depression and anxiety and my employer is not at all helpful. Prior to the incident I was working in a processing centre but due to mu injuries I requested a transfer to an office closer to home and I was granted a temp transfer. To get the transfer I had to prove to the executive managers that I was suffering a mental health injury first by attending an appointment with 2 IME’s. I ended up having to take a month off work after suffering a breakdown due to what I perceived as bullying from the execs. The transfer was successful and I found myself working with a lot more supportive staff including the manager but it had its downside as well as there was customer aggression on a weekly basis and I often had triggers from the same type of people I was threaten by in my own home but I was doing well. We had even discussed my staying there on a permanent basis which overall I was happy with. Then a few weeks ago my PTSD and depression spiraled out of control and I had to take another month off work to get myself in a better place. I then get a call from the manager telling me I would have to return to my previous place of work and that they would not allow me to stay there. An hour later I get a call from the previous office with a big list of demands regarding my days and hours, and what’s required in order to negotiate. I have always been part time but had to reduce my hours down even further because of the PTSD and depression. I also have a chronic medical condition which results in severe fatigue, muscle and bone pain, memory and concentration problems add that in with the others and my life is pretty crappy. I honestly don’t know if I can continue fighting not only my demons on a regular basis and now my employer any more. I’m physically and mentally exhausted, I was hoping to try and apply for TPI but with my super fund the hoops you have to jump through are enough to put you off and my rehab consultant told me I was not sick enough to even try. Should I stay and make myself sicker or just give up the ghost and throw in the towel and retire ? I really don’t know how to move forward with this !",pippi9699,Community Member,21-04-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-depression-and-no-support-from-my-employer/td-p/498684
PTSD-1010,Reset button,"Hi, I am 38, turning 39, female and a bit over three weeks now I left my house and my former partner and faced the virus head on rather then deal with said former partner. So you could say I was a bit desperate. I found myself a safe place to stay at a backpacker hostel and was in such poor metal and emotional state that I shut down for a few days, which lead to me been reported missing. Once I reassured the Police I was actually ok, it still took me a few days to recover enough to get in back in touch with my sister who has been a massive help. She kept me going even when said former partner started emailing me, trying to get me to come back. The actions he took while I have been gone, from what I've been told, has led to him been arrested. I have been assured that is safe for me now to return home. While I am a little apprehensive, I am hoping that I can reset my life and move forward from here.",Mar8ie,Community Member,05-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/reset-button/td-p/472775
PTSD-1011,Hopeful new member,"Hi everyone Sophie suggested I start a new thread, am I posting in the right place? I'm new here. I've been reading some posts for a while now and was too nervous to join. I'm nervous now writing this! But I felt so much of myself being mirrored in the posts here and wanted to join a community where I felt understood. Barely a person can, but it's not their fault lol. I am grateful that others haven't been through same. I posted quite a bit last night and am not familiar with the workings of the site, I will work it out somehow lol. I feel like I wrote so much about myself last night that I don't want to repeat myself but here I go... I have LOTS of children, am a single parent and work more than full time. All of us have experienced far too much trauma for words to ever express. All of us have exhibited signs of PTSD and C-PTSD has been mentioned more than once. We all receive varying amounts of counselling, psychologist support and sometimes a lot of extra support in our places of work and school. It is exhausting seeking and finding a person to trust in getting help in almost every sector for each of us, I have been doing that for decades in one form or another. I have found that no one has all the answers but I really appreciate the people who have tried their best. I am not sure how much to disclose here but basically because I was directed to report to scary sectors, our family can receive free counselling for the rest of our lives. A lot of what we suffered is like a horror movie but worse, we lived it. Those things are in the past for us, hopefully forever, but the memories and dreams are haunting us still. My children sometimes tell me about their frightening memories. I don't know what to do when my children express their own horrors to me but my counsellor said I am doing okay with these moments. I listen. Nod. Hug them. Cry with them. Tell them they are amazing and beautiful. Reinforce that we will NEVER let this be in our lives again. I was completely unaware of the worst things that happened to my children. I have reported my guts out over everything and been in every Court imaginable, almost. I have strong negative views about legal processes. On the flip side I am trying to fit the pieces together of all the things I've learnt to become a happy person. Happiness is SO HARD to get. I settle for contentment if I can find it in moments throughout the day. I try to remember to smile, that's a nice contagion.

PTSD-1012,Grieving estrangement from daughter,"I have a daughter, only child, aged 23. We have been very close her whole life. Possibly too close as I have a history of family abuse during my own childhood and strove to create a loving bond with my daughter. I'm not a perfect parent, but have supported MG (my girl) throughout her life and built a very close relationship. She has been in a de facto relationship for 2 years with a 24 yo man who has disengaged from his own family, has no friends and seems to have a problem with my daughter's friends. Recently he had upset MG very much and I went to visit, that night she didn't come home and in worry I confronted her BF. My daughter was angry with me and I apologised to her BF later. He however had been pressuring MG to stop having a relationship with me, as he has done with his own family. She has recently decided to distance herself from me. I respect her decision and am trying to just give her space, whilst letting her know I'm here for her. However I'm worried about her as she deals with depression. I'm also very hurt and angry, which I suppose is grief. I'd love some advice on how to distance and detach a little from the parenting relationship, so I can heal my own feelings, without cutting MG off completely. I'm also ending a long term relationship atm, and although we are mostly amicable and I have a new direction re home for myself I'm feeling a bit sad & lost with what is going on.

I always feel alone and unable to connect with people. Since high school I’ve been having problems with social interactions. I talk fine with my family and very close friends, but with others my mind usually goes blank and I lose track of the conversation. Other times I know what I want to say and I keep repeating it in my head but it just doesn’t come out. I moved to a new place five months ago and it got worse because I don’t get to talk much with my family and close friends anymore. I’ve had online friendships but I failed to maintain them. I feel so detached from everyone. People are generally nice to me but I feel like all I ever do is disappointing them. I used to be fun and social when I was younger, how did I turn into this?

PTSD-1014,Drowning in Depression,"I have suffered this for over 30 years, but have never had it as bad as this. Married to an alcoholic for 25 years who has emotionally and psychologically abused me and our 16yo daughter to the point where she has freaked out so bad that we had to call police to take her to hospital. While there they questioned me about his alcoholism and i finally broke down and told them everything going on, daughter and i both gave statements and the following day husband was served with a family violence intervention order and removed from house. Our court case was last Thursday and i was not allowed to attend as it was police who served not me. He was given a 6 month complete no communication order.

PTSD-1015,PTSD and anxiety getting worse as I get older,"Hi there, I am new to this type of forum. I am in my mid 50s and have a PTSD, depression and anxiety. I guess in some ways I am high functioning but everyone I work with and those who 'know me' call me too sensitive. My childhood was full of domestic violence and physical and emotional abuse towards me and my siblings by my father. He was an incredibly violent alcoholic. For years I thought my upbringing was normal. Also, for years, therapists tried to tell me it wasn't. Over the past 5 years my anxiety has increased a hundred fold. I was being bullied in two different workplaces and my PTSD is currently being triggered by a charge being brought against a close friend. A nephew took his own life 4 years ago and a niece has been in and out of hospital with drug induced psychosis. I am really upset for my friend as I know they would never do what they are accused of. My case was a little different. I managed my traumatic upbringing by becoming a party girl and I did something stupid when drunk. I no longer drink and haven't for quite a while but this has followed me around all these years as it has impacted my employment. When I tell people they just laugh but to me it wasn't funny. Now my friend is being accused of something terrible and I know exactly how he would be feeling. He has also now expressed that he doesn't want to live anymore. I really feel for him but there is nothing I can do to help except listen. My GP recently put me on anti-depressants and I was referred to a psychologist but they never rang. (where I live you have to wait for their call). I am isolated as working from home and my partner works away. I seem t have constant flashbacks of all of the stupid things I did in my 20s and I feel like I have wasted my life. I have constant anxiety and I don't want to return to work (where I was bullied) when the restrictions lift but we need the money and I need the job. I feel like a failure even though form the outside people think my life looks great. All of this triggered by the issue my friend is going through. I can't talk to my partner as he can't cope with when I am not 'coping'. I just don't know what to do. I am exercising, eating healthily, trying to focus on other things but I am consumed by fear for my friend. If anyone reads this I am sorry that it is all over the place.",borders,Community Member,02-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-and-anxiety-getting-worse-as-i-get-older/td-p/468093
PTSD-1016,Feeling hopeless,"I have wanted to leave my relationship for some time now but it all came to a head 2 weeks ago. My partner saw me and tried to initiate sex. I said I didn’t want to because I still had to put the kids to bed. I wasn’t interested. He pressed the issue and we had sex anyway. Of course one by one the kids came in as small children do. He stopped each time and threw a blanket over us and told the kids to get out. I was feeling humiliated. The third time we were interrupted I walked away and he got angry with our daughter because of it. I scooped her up and took her to my bed. The next morning I asked if he thought his behaviour was respectful to anyone in the house that night. He said “well you were having sex with me too” I told him I was breaking up with him. That I didn’t love him. For 2 days he seemed to accept it and then went back to normal. I broke up with him again 2 days ago over the phone. We discussed dividing assets etc. and then he came home and said let’s find you a hobby, you aren’t coping at home with the kids. I don’t work, I look after our 3 kids (all under 5). The accountant has allocated part of his earnings to me so my tax returns looks like I have earned $200,000 a year so I am not entitled to any support from Centrelink. He won’t move out, or accept the breakup and I have no access to funds to leave. I find myself crying at the drop of a hat, not eating, drinking wine which I shouldn’t because I take medication for anxiety and hiding in my wardrobe or the laundry for 10 mins to get away from the noise. The situation feels like it will never get better and I wonder why I can’t cope when everyone else around me seems fine. All I want to do is fall apart but I know I can’t do that because my kids need me.",Island11,Community Member,02-05-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/feeling-hopeless/td-p/467627
PTSD-1017,Emotional deprivation/ childhood emotional neglect,"Hello, this is my first post but I’ve been reading the forum for a while. as background, I am in ongoing therapy for my anorexia, and associated depression and anxiety. I’m working with my therapist to uncover the underlying issues to my AN. we have uncovered a history of emotional deprivation / childhood emotional neglect - as my parents in turn did not receive emotional support from their parents and never learned these things themselves. It was a huge shock to me to realise this in my past as I had been completely unaware of it at the time, thinking I’d had a ‘perfect’ childhood and ‘perfect’ parents who gave me everything I needed. so to the point: when i am feeling emotional pain or distress, I find that it is NOT helpful for others (friends, therapist, GP etc) to offer reassurance or to remind me that I’m doing well or that it will get better soon. This makes me feel so invalidated and I’ve had to train my support people not to use those more common techniques. I am learning to identify and validate my own emotions as true and real. So I need them to exist, as they are, as difficult as they may be. It’s been very difficult for my support people to learn this. is there anyone else here who has suffered similar CEN experiences have a similar response to people trying to make you feel better? Since CEN is invisible/ defined by what DIDN’T happen I can’t find others to share my experience with so thought I’d try here. thank you.

PTSD-1018,Slow rollercoaster of ups and downs.,"Since child hood I feel like my life has been a slow roller coaster of ups and downs, Abusive narsistic mother, absent father, long term out of love relationship with first 2 children's father, cheated in and left me.

Since then I’ve tried medication and therapy. They were somewhat helpful, until they weren’t anymore. Mostly I just cope by not thinking about it. I have no feelings about it really, but the trouble is I have no feelings about anything else either. I have young children so this is problematic. If my children cry I will comfort them because I know that is what they want, but I don’t feel anything when they cry anymore. I feel defective and broken. I feel like I’m not a real mother. I take care of their needs, but the connection isn’t there. I’m not really interested in life or the future. I don’t care about anything. I used to be so close to my family, but I just feel disconnected from everyone now ... and not because of the social distancing rules. I have felt this way for at least a year.

PTSD-1026,Am i the only one rejection consume,"This is my first time here and its come at the stage in my life where i have lost everything i love because i have pushed and pushed until they couldn't take it anymore. Im try to get help but opening up is terrifying and only possible in small windows which never seem to be open at the right time. Its great for everyone to say get help, like its that easy!!! Truth is, ive been carrying my pain since i was six years old when my sexual abuse started. I have been almost re living the worst days of my life in my mind over and over in my head for the last five years, only having a chance to breathe in that small space between starting to drink and being too drunk to see reason. My partner who i love with all of my heart, bore the brunt of my fears and to be honest, i couldn't even see the effect i was having on her when i was in that state. I hate me for that. When we met, for the first few years, things were great, she knew i had been abused but not in any detail. She was proud of me for being so strong and i guess at the time i was. Over time, after we had our three beautiful children, the intimacy between us died and the past just kept coming back. It was as tho every advance i made was rejected, i couldn't work it out. I put it down to me, not being good enough and all of the related feelings that go with it. Eventually, i feel i let all of my good intentions become a quest for a sexual connection again because for me, feeling rejected sexually had become a trigger. To me, my abuser never rejected me, he is the only one who wants me. I dont know how this thought process manifested itself because there were reasons that explained the lack of intimacy but none seemed to take away the rejection i felt. So i would internalises it and push it away. We would make up for the outbursts i had in a quick fix till next time cycle. The thoughts never went away, the past grew more and more into my present. I feel like im going crazy, im panicking as i write this. I really dont know what to do. I just want to treat the ones i love like i want to, why do i let being raped as a child be the defining part of my life. It changes and rules everything. I want to tell her everything. But the reason i couldn't for all of those years was that it would hurt her less to feel i felt rejected by her, to fight and make up for that than to let her see and feel the pain i do. Has anyone else out there had those feelings?

PTSD-1027,Going to court to give evidence,"I'm not sure if this is the right section, but I was just wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how to ease the emotional (I guess anxiety mostly), about having to face a perpetrator in court? I'm still months away and it'll probably be delayed because of corona virus, and I need to try and live my life right now and all the way up to and beyond then. I'm struggling to function. I'm either stuck in bed staring at the ceiling, sitting at my computer staring at my work (which unfortunately doesn't get done by desire alone), standing somewhere staring at nothing, you get the point. The amount of times in the last few months since I reported and it got to the court stage I've found myself in a zombie state is increasing as October draws nearer. I'm desperate to feel like I'm around about at my normal. I'm scared I'm going to give myself an ulcer or something, let alone give up because the whole justice system feels just as much like an abuser... My PTSD is worse too. I'm jumping at the sight of people who look a certain way, or sounds from anything I can't see or identify immediately. And to 'help' myself, I thought I'd get a new shepherd pup, after grieving the loss of her predecessors. Wellity well well... I damn forgot how exhausting puppies were, didn't I? Now I'm struggling to keep the house clean too. And really young people (dogs in this case) are primarily interested in what they're getting (food, a warm bed and a pat), so there's not a whole lot of support coming my way. Although she does love a cuddle, and when I had a cold a few weeks back, she was soooooo good. So I think if I can keep myself going, I will have a very good friend for at least another decade. And right at the end, the real reason for my stress - how do you deal with it if the court finds your abuser a better witness than you? I mean it's easy for them, they only have to deny it. They haven't had 30-odd years of punishing themselves for what a piece of shit did to them when they were a child.",Boobella,Community Member,28-04-2020,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/going-to-court-to-give-evidence/td-p/437954

PTSD-1030,PTSD from shoulder fracture,"Hi everyone Due to a trip and fall onto concrete, I sustained a brutal injury to my right shoulder and had to wait 3 weeks for surgery, needing to take opiates for the pain. Before then I was a fit and healthy person having recommenced University studies this year. I also loved weight training. Since the reverse shoulder reconstruction surgery five weeks ago not only has my physical health declined but so has my mental health. I think this is partly due to the anaesthetics and opiates but also major grief. I had so many plans for 2020 and am mourning the loss of those plans. I am undergoing counselling at this point in time but still feel so lost. My counsellor has said I have PTSD. I think the reason that I'm reacting so strongly as well to my injury and operation is that my mum fell and broke her shoulder in the kitchen at her unit in 2018. Mum needed the same operation. My sister was her carer and was supposed to be looking after mum properly and this didn't happen. I still blame my sister for this. Mum ended up in hospital delirious with pain and having to be on heavy duty medication. Mum never was the same afterwards and she was hallucinating and ended up in rehab for 3 months and then was diagnosed with a delusional disorder. From the date of the injury to her passing, it was six months. It's only been a year since my mum’s passed so I think what she went through keeps coming up for me but having had the misfortune to have the same injury as her, makes my trauma worse.

He had a very traumatic childhood; alcoholic father, sexually abused, friends' deaths by suicide, etc.. He drinks. Alot. And when he does he gets abusive, emotionally, verbally and physically. He does not hit me, but he'll throw something in my direction, or lean right into my face and shout. He says he doesn't care about anyone else. He used to say that his mother was the only person he cared about then she passed away 4 months ago. On three occasions, i am embarrassed to say, I have got physical with him. In my mind, it is to make him stop what he's doing. To try to make him see what he's doing, to try to make him snap out of it. Obviously it never works, it makes everything worse. On Saturday, he was going crazy.. he was blasting music at 3am trying to wake our neighbors, he was shouting.. it all came out of nowhere. Things got physical and then he told me to leave. He got an AVO against me last year after another similar incident, so he holds that over me. If I leave him he will call the police. I have pleaded with him to get help. He tried going to AA, and after 1 or 2 meetings he decides there's no point and continues drinking. He went to see a psychologist, but kept missing appointments because he was drunk. I know that he's a good man. I know that he loves me, and that he doesn't want to be like this. I know that when this episode is over, he will be remorseful and will cry and say he's going to get help. I also know he will take no responsibility for his part in any of it. It will still be my fault.. I suppose what I'm hoping is that someone may have been in a similar situation and can suggest a way of getting him help. Thanks for reading and providing this outlet.",M2219,Community Member,13-04-2020,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/boyfriend-is-alcoholic-won-t-get-help/td-p/482126
PTSD-1033,I'm not sure how to go about this,"Hello, I don't know what to do with these thoughts that are scarred into my memory. I have the feeling of hating humans in general, a sense of anger and resentment, highly sceptical and distrustful of others. I am struggling to build new friendships and interacting with people in my daily life because of negative thoughts and emotions attached to building a relationship with people following some life events. I will try my best to keep it concise. I left home and my parents in 2014 because of the toxic environment that I grew up in and how sheltered I was from gaining life experiences and make any progress towards creating my own future. To elaborate on the toxic environment, I was groomed to be a trophy child and a retirement plan for my parents (first-generation immigrants) so expectations were high with very little emotional support. Anyways, I graduated in 2017 from the degree I wanted following my detachment from my parents, I built up some network and set myself up for a new graduate job that started in 2018. All of this was very challenging for me with the amount of anxiety and the lack of self-esteem that developed from being so suppressed throughout my development until I was 20. In 2018, I landed my dream job but 6 months later my boss started to psychologically abuse me due to a conflict in our opinions and this triggered something very deep and dark from my past and eventually, so I quit and moved back with my parents to restart from the ground up and sought assistance from a General Practitioner and a Psychologist. With my psychologist, I discovered that many of my emotional and traumatic triggers were stemming from my relationship with my parents so I worked to rebuild my relationship with my parents. One day I was talking about suicide and self-harm, which I intended to do before I left home in 2014, and I received a response from each of my parents; my dad told me that I'm an ungrateful child and my mum told me that bearing me inside of her womb was an accident and a mistake and I ruined both of their life goals and aspirations. I left home again shortly after, found a new job (which I'm very stable with) and my relationship with my parents have grown further apart. Around the same time that I had this chat with my parents, my best friend who was my safe haven and a place of comfort through my hardship started to hurt me emotionally and psychologically. I communicated these problems but they refused to apologise and hurt me further.",MysteryPerson,Community Member,22-04-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-m-not-sure-how-to-go-about-this/td-p/500014

PTSD-1035,Really struggling with anxiety tonight,"Hi, I have PTSD and I see a psychologist and up till 16 months ago my symptoms were relatively manageable. I had a bad experience in hospital and it triggered a lot of my previous traumas. The anxiety started becoming an issue then. I don't seem to be able to manage any kind of stress at all at the minute. For the past 6 months we have been preparing for, and then put our home on the market. The stress this caused was enormous for me. I have started having panic attacks, something I haven't had in years. Due to the Coronavirus we took our house off the market earlier this week. The past couple of days I started to relax a bit, despite the fact that financially were strapped, we really needed the house to sell. Then today my husband got a text message from the real estate agent to say he had someone he wanted to bring through. My anxiety immediately went through the roof. I don't cope well with chaos and it all feels chaotic. I am trying to monitor my breathing, I have tried to meditate but I can't get my brain to quieten down. I don't see my psychologist till Thursday next week. I'm trying to spin out my appointments because I've used all my sessions on the MHP. Just at my wits end. I haven't slept properly in months. So tired and so fed up with PTSD. Sorry about the rant. I'm hoping my posting this it help get some of it out of my head. I've been writing but that's not helping either.",Mara56,Blue Voices Member,16-04-2020,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/really-struggling-with-anxiety-tonight/td-p/486618
PTSD-1036,Struggling with effects of childhood sexual abuse on adulthood.,"Hello, I'm new here. I don't really know how to start. I grew up in what I thought was a loving family. Mum and dad fought constantly I hated it and it scared me. From early age dad sexually abused me. I grew up very scared and confused and constantly on edge and would space out all the time - like my mind would leave and I would'nt see hear or feel anything only scenes in my mind. I still experience the on edge and space out stuff. Mum approached me around age 10 asking if anything had happened to me. At the time I couldn't think and everything was so fuzzy so I said I didn't know. To which she replied with if anything did happen you would know it. Now in my 20s. A lot has come back to me and it is really crippling. Only really told one very close friend. I feel so alone and scared. And just generally don't know how to deal with it all. More recently I had my first boyfriend of 18 months brake up with me. It's been a super rough road. Over the years there's periods where I feel like a normal human being and nothing seems to bother me. And then from time to time (more commonly recently). it's all very overwhelming and I can't seem to function normally and space out all the time. Scream at ridiculous things. But it feels so real and I find myself crying about it. Will it ever stop. I know I need help but don't know where to start and too scared to talk to anyone about it face to face or even over phone...",Swan23,Community Member,18-04-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-with-effects-of-childhood-sexual-abuse-on-adulthood/td-p/490464
PTSD-1037,FROM ONE SIDE OF THIN BLUE LINE TO THE OTHER,"Hi there one and all, I'm a former Police Officer, and as with any former serving member, we've all pretty much seen the inhumanity of humanity at its worst. There's a saying in the job ""when the sun goes down and the people go home, the animals come to prey"". It's an unfortunate reality of our society today and my heart goes out to all the serving and former members of the thin blue line that keeps most of us safe at night. Having said that, my time in the job I call my ""baptism of fire"". I went in bright eyed and bushy tailed as one person, and came out the other side something quite different. Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, Alcoholism, Suicide etc are all accepted pars for the course of being a Police Officer. So, I can speak from first hand experience myself having survived the journey. Many of my fellow colleges didn't make it and took their own lives. It's for these fallen fellow officers I find myself here today looking to help others. It wasn't that long ago I could easily have been a caller reaching out for help.

PTSD-1039,PTSD from abusive ex boyfriend then 8 or more of his friends got involved and now stalk me - struggling with daily triggers. Please help,"I dont know where to start. I have a learning difficulty so its very hard for me to understand what is happening to me and then to put it in words.. so please excuse me while I try. I have severe PTSD. Basically what my ex did to me is very graphic and not appropriate for some users to read, he repeated doing things to me over 3ish years before I could leave him. He also had filmed me 24/7 and possibly even the things he did to me. Then he told me that his friends got involved. Now I fear that they are stalking me and I don't know what to do. Some of the guys I met on dating apps and out in the clubs, they started behaving like him and did things that he used to do to me and eventually one even told me that he was spying on me for my ex! They all knew private things about my life that they shouldn't know about. At the same time I am having triggers daily and its destroying my current relationship, its making me want to turn to substance. I don't know what details I can give you as the stuff that happened and still happens today as its most likely going to upset readers. Questions I would like help with: What do I do about my stalkers? How do they know private things about me? How can I accept that there is footage of me out there I didn't know about? Do I need to go to the authorities? How can I manage daily triggers? How can I explain to my current partner whats happening? How do I know what is PTSD and not? I am so destroyed.

The psychiatrist wants me to do this 2 week in patient treatment to trial meds and im wondering if anyone else has done it?

PTSD-1041,Numb  for years after abuse and toxic family/friends,"Hi All, I was reading some of the threads and was impressed by people's honesty. So I decided to start a new thread to share myself what I have been through. Last year I got very unwell and had to get mental health help from the public hospital. I was suicidal. I had no friends, was crumbling, living alone and developed horrible body dsymorphia. I looked in the mirror and was disgusted. I couldn't believe things could get so bad, like that you can kind of just die while still living. i was not taking care of myself and was a zombie at work. I told a few people I was suicidal and they didn't care. My family haven't been there for me at all, although I have one sibling who tries. A family member abused me verbally for years and destroyed my self esteem, and I'm only now putting together the pieces. I'm very numb. I keep hearing the word disacociating (terrible spelling) - ---and a light is going onfor me, it feels like the right word for what i've felt. I think that was a part of how I survived for years, by disaccoiating. I used to have friends and go out a lot but slowly I just narrowed my life down to myself, and I was alone all the time, and very sad. It became normal and I just pushed through it, until one day I couldn't any more. The triage was very helpful and pointed me to a group that helps people who are suicidal.... anyway.... i'm still here and feeling like i have a new lease on life.

PTSD-1042,New here - childhood troubles,"Hi there, I sometimes lose so much sleep over this and really hope someone can offer me some advice. When I was a kid, probably around 9 or 10, I had experimented with both a neighbour and my cousin. As a gay kid growing up in a very strict Catholic and narrow minded family, I had nobody to talk to about this. It was never abusive and nobody was forcing anybody to do anything, we were curious and didn’t know it was wrong. I realise now that I’ve grown up that I’ve carried so much shame and regret about it and sometimes it feels like it consumes me. I wish it never happened and it makes me feel awful. We didn’t do it anymore once we’d grown up and we never spoke about it again, assuming we all regretted it and would prefer to pretend it never happened. I wish it hadn’t more than anything else in my life. I hate that it happened and would never EVER do anything that made someone else uncomfortable but was something wrong with me? Please tell me someone else has gone/is going through something like this?

PTSD-1043,In need of support..plus want to say thankyou for prior help etc xx,"So I'm relatively new to the forums here and already I feel so welcome and accepted. I posted my first post about a week ago stating I was alone during this crazy messed up covid eppedemic I had quiet a few responses and it blew me away knowing people actually took time out of their lives to Contact me and make me feel supported and less lonely in my time of sadness. What it did make me realise though is I have so much more past/(and present) underlying issues and trauma I need to address. I have a small (very small) select real life group of friends (that I obviously can't see atm) and not many of those Friends understand or wish to understand the reasons I suffer from ptsd,aniexty, depression etc. I was speaking to one in particular yesterday and I started on a roll about my upbringing and my life story And how in my short time on this earth I have already encountered so much and she was shocked and it Made me realise that my life is not normal ,the things I have endured are not normal that I need help and that I need people in my life who I can relate to that understand me a little better and accept me for me and realise I act and say the things I do because I know what having a non normal life is like. Since the age of 6 I have seen councilors, doctors, pyschs ,etc I've tried medications and therapies to no avail yet . As I get older my condition gets worse and everyday I tell myself and everyone around me I am fine but I'm not . I guess I'm just reaching out for support from people who actually get it , not just say they do . People who have suffered and overcame, people who are struggling but are coping, people who aren't Afraid to put their hands up and admit they to need help , love and support . Because I'm now at that point in life . I want to start my healing journey properly......

PTSD-1045,Emotional detachment - Could it be related to my childhood sexual trauma or toxic relationship.,"First time poster. I will try keep it as short as I can but abit of back story, I was sexually assaulted when I was around 8-11 (not exactly sure) by my older cousin.. I grew up really struggling with it as I thought I had told my mum or sister at the time it happened and nothing was done about it nor was it dealt with in any kind of way so I guess I grew up thinking maybe that what happened to me wasn't a big deal or maybe they just don't care about me, Since having my own children I struggled even more as I could imagine if anything in anyway happened to them I would handle it ALOT differently, Its also hard because my father still acts as if nothing happened and he is still talks with his nephew as if nothing happened. I got into a relationship when I was 17, had my first baby with him at 18, he did show signs of abuse at the start (he wouldn't allow me to leave the room when arguing and he became very aggressive. This was my first real relationship, 2 kids later and a marriage, I decided I needed to get out of the toxic marriage, I struggled for years and stayed because I wanted my children to have their parents together (I grew up with both mine together despite my dad also being abusive and using drugs my whole life) So seeing my mum put up with that and staying with him through anything I felt like leaving wasn't an option until one day we were in the car arguing infront of my young children and he threatened to hurt me (there was alot more problems), I knew from that moment I needed to start planning a way to leave, it wasn't easy, there was times he would message me telling me his self-harming right now and it's my fault my children won't have a dad (really regularly). Fast forward to now I finally met someone amazing, treats me so well and honestly treats my children like his own and at first I couldn't have been happier, almost a year on I'm 20 weeks pregnant and lately have really struggled emotionally, if we do argue (normally over something small) I just feel so detached and like i have no emotional feeling at all, which then makes him feel unloved and like I don't care, I'm also not as affectionate as I was with him at the start.. I'm wondering if this has anything to do with my past? and what help do I need? I don't want to make him to feel that way, I do realize I was also like this during my marriage with my ex, especially towards the end.. I just want to feel normal",LS_baby,Community Member,12-04-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/emotional-detachment-could-it-be-related-to-my-childhood-sexual/td-p/480326
PTSD-1046,Mum Diagnosed with Cancer in QLD and I’m in Vic with border Isolation,"Hi, I found out Thursday that my Mum, who lives in QLD, has stage 3 lung cancer. I’m in Victoria. Because she’s not terminal (although has been told she has 3 years to live after Chemotherapy and surgery) I still can’t get to her. I had what one could say was a tumultuous childhood and have PTSD, anxiety and depression as a result. My Mum allowed her husband to commit physical and emotional abuse on me and my siblings (she was in a domestic violence relationship too.) We’ve tried to patch up the relationship over the years and now I don’t tell her when I’m feeling angry at her because I don’t want to hurt her as she carries a lot of guilt. Now I’m so distressed about her illness and not being able to be there I’m having flashbacks and intrusive thoughts of traumatic events. It’s been made worse because she told my half sister (who doesn’t like me) first and she got across the border before the lock down. Now the half sister has convinced Mum that even if I could get there I’d pose a risk to Mums health... but she and her husband went desk shopping (something she could’ve done online and had delivered) yesterday, going to multiple stores and interacting with a Petri dish of strangers I feel so sad for Mum and her prognosis but at the same time I feel betrayed and angry for not having the chance to get there before the border closures, for not being told straight away (like my half sister was). This makes me feel so guilty too as this shouldn’t be about me, it should be about Mum. I’m feeling very fragile today and have had self harm thoughts. My psychiatrist is closed until Tuesday so I can’t get anything to help sleep or medication for my out of control anxiety and bursting into tears every five minutes. What to do?

PTSD-1047,Childhood Trauma (sexual abuse),"I am new to the forum and I haven’t really done anything like this but I am looking for new ways to cope with my depression, anxiety and PTSD. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist for these diagnoses’ however the worst time for me is in the middle of the night when everything is still and quiet and I have nothing to do but sit and be with my thoughts. I have been struggling more than usual these past couple weeks with my anxiety skyrocketing and having flashbacks and a lot of PTSD symptoms. I haven’t slept in days and I am exhausted. Self harm is something I always seem to go to in time’s like these. I just feel useless and alone and scared and I know that tomorrow and the next day and the day after that I will go through the same cycle over and over and over again. Somedays I feel like I just don’t want to get up. I have to force myself to get through the day. Anxiety is a part of my everyday and it’s exhausting. I don’t want to do this anymore. I was sexually abused by 3 different men at 3 different stages in my life. When I was 7 for a few year then again when I was 13 and again at 16 for a few years. I find it difficult to not blame myself. I simply can’t see that 3 different men all thought the same thing at 3 different times in my life. I must have done something to deserve what happened. I must have provoked it. I blame myself and so punish myself all the time. lately I have been having a lot of flashbacks and when that happens it is immobilising. It feels like I am right back there all over again. I feel the sensations, I feel the touch and feel how my body reacted to what’s happened...it is literally like you are reliving it all over again and again again. Like it wasn’t enough to go through it once. I have also had a few panic attacks recently which are the worst thing ever. I hate that this is my life. It feels like none of it will ever get better.

PTSD-1048,How do I stop having breakdowns when i see/think about my toxic ex-boyfriend,"Hi ! Background info: I dated my ex in high school before breaking up half way through first year uni. It was a very toxic relationship and I will say I also started to become toxic near the end which I am not anymore. However I did develop depression and severe anxiety while dating him which mainly stemmed from the fact I never knew if the next day he'd break up with me and if he loved me as there had been incidents where he was kept bringing up other girls and talking to them openly flaunting it to me. He was emotionally abusive and extremely manipulative (I have come to realise he had severe self-esteem issues on reflection). This lead to me not being able to eat, sleep, do basic functions, lose weight, and overall just become weak and overall I have traumatic memories of this period with bits missing in my memory and my mind not addressing this period of time mentally. Once we broke up however my life did get a lot better. However, it was a very messy breakup and I know I walked away and kept with my friends and tried not to interact nor cause drama with the people he knew out of common decency. However since the break up he has spread rumours about me , stalked me both in person and via social media, left letters at my door, messaged me numerous time and inappropriately tried to contact friends. Some of these activities happening one or two years after we broke up and even when he was dating another girl. SO anytime I see him in public, I know he is a coward and won't come and talk to me ever HOWEVER I still get extremely anxious and at times start to break down (tearing up, vision goes blurry, nauseous) seeing him as I get scared and start to think what if and mentally start thinking of the past wrongs. My question is are there any ways I can prevent or ease these sorts of behaviours and thoughts when I do see him. I'm sick of feeling anxious every time I think he may be in the area and want to ease my own mind to not have these reactions.

PTSD-1050,The three Musketeers and the damage to me.,"Hi Everyone, I call the the family I once had, the three Musketeers. It somewhat takes a little of the sting out for me. I was not able to use my voice for 40 years and I stayed quiet. I can't anymore. I was horrifically abused by all 3 Musketeers.The usual brood, 1 mother, 1 father and 1 younger sibling. I have no contact with all 3 Musketeers anymore. There is a lot to deal with. Older Musketeer Female has NPD. I only discovered this 2 days ago. I'm trying to make sense of one incident out of the thousands. When I was 14 or 15, the three Musketeers left me at home alone on Christmas Eve to go and celebrate it with another family that we did every year. I cried all night alone. I cannot understand this event and it is still hard to face it yet it haunts me so. I had a falling out with this families daughter. Their daughter had lied about something I did not do and it was a serious allegation. No one believed me at the time. I knew I was innocent of this accusation. Their daughter made life at high school for me hell and systematically manipulated school authorities to turn in me too. I went into a deep depression and no one cared to ask me if I was ever ok? No one at all. Not even the three Musketeers. Much later in life the older female musketeer said to me that the daughters mother said to her that night that I was still welcome there that evening. No further discussion was had on it. I made no comment. On the older female Musketeers 60th birthday she said she had a surprise for everyone. I was a bit excited. The surprise.... The daughters parents attending my mother's birthday. Did not know till they arrived. I said nothing. I stayed quiet. I have stayed quiet all my life. My issues is not with the daughters parents, it is with the older female musketeer and the other two Musketeers. I see now separating what happened as it is two different stories mixed in with one that I was a victim from the daughter from these parents. I see now the incredible damage it did to me and my life. I have decided to do my own victim impact statement and send it to the parents of this daughter. I'm doing it for me and that's right for me. I don't understand.

PTSD-1052,Narcissistic parent/s,"Hi all, so what has made me come here is a recent argument with my mum. This is the only real argument we've ever had and it's made me realise that she is a narcissist (my dad is possibly one too but right now I'm dealing with mum). My whole life I have just put up with her behaviour and have always seen it as just the way she is. It always seemed to hard to say anything negative about her behaviour because she'd make such a drama about it and it just didn't feel worth it. I have a 1 year old and am not going to put up with it all anymore for his sake. She goes against my wishes constantly and does the opposite of what she's been asked. This includes (but definitely isn't limited to) giving him food I've asked her not to give him, sharing photos of him with my brother who has a serious drug issue (I had no contact with him, hadn't told him I was pregnant and her explanation of why she did it without asking me was ""you would've said no"") and touching his head where his skull hasn't fused, even though I have asked her not to on multiple occasions. My childhood was quite unstable. My parents split twice. My mother attempted suicide twice (I don't believe she had any intention of it succeeding as she contacted people while doing it) and apart from all that it was just a very unstable environment centred around my parents and what they needed and were feeling. I finally got sick of it and sent her a list of things that she has done that are the opposite of what I asked. I also brought up things from my childhood and her response was basically that she disagrees with the things I've raised about my son so my concerns don't matter. In relation to my childhood her message was ""I can't change the past. It sounds to me like you're resentful and angry about the part and only you can deal with that, just like I'm dealing with my past. There was no selfishness involved, it's much more complicated than that. I'm sorry you feel that way. I love you and wish you didn't have so much anger in you."" She has never taken responsibility for anything in her life from big things like the attempted suicides in my childhood to the smallest things like spilling milk on the floor. If something doesn't fit her narrative then she just lies about it, even if you witnessed it. I know this is all part of her mental health issues but I'm really struggling with it as I know I can't get her to change or understand how I feel but it makes me so sad that she possibly won't be in my sons life.",ElectricBlue,Community Member,18-03-2020,PTSD and trauma,15,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/narcissistic-parent-s/td-p/489256

PTSD-1056,Childhood trauma impacting as adult,"Hello... How do you even start? How do you possible write about your trauma when you cant even think about it properly? I was abused as a child. By someone close to me. It took me 3 years to tell someone. I was embarrassed. How do you talk about that? I told my mother. She didn't help me. I told my aunt. She didn't help me. I told my dad. He didn't help me. My adolescent years were difficult. My mum describes me as being nasty during those times. I didn't care at the time. Why would I? No one cared about me.. nothing happened after I told the people who were supposed to protect me. Years later here I am. Horrible anxiety, fears, manic depression, bad eatting habbits.. all because of those times. I'm tired. I'm tired all the time. I am happy, I have many things to love but have sadness. When does it go away? I used to smoke but I quit. I always think about smoking. I used to drink but I don't anymore. I want to drink all the time. Sometimes I cry. Not for any reasons.. well I mean there is reasons but I'm usually okay in the moment. Sometimes I can't breathe. Sometimes I don't want anyone near me. I have to be alone because talking is to hard. I cannot stand loud noise. I would rather watch the TV with subtitles because the sound is too much. I can't talk to more than 3 people at once. It's too much. My job is hard. I work for Child Protection. I have to protect the children. It's how I give back what was taken from me. How long does this last? When does it feel okay? I don't love myself. I'm discusgting.

PTSD-1058,Child of Disfunction.,"Many years ago i found my way in to ACA. I was in so much denial that i was reenacting my childhood traumas in my adult life. I made progress, but alas a year ago a move to a different state and work pressures i fell back into my same unhealthy pattern of procrastination and self pity. I am now in full blown relapse and with the current state of affairs in the world feeling more isolated then ever. I see no clear path but i know i have to get help and most importantly support. With no way to connect with people in person i am taking a leap into the online world. Doing something is better than doing nothing right? Its daunting to be back at the beginning and the programmed defaults in me tell me to give up it too hard. But what I'm certain of is i need to stop waiting for something to change and actually be the change that i need in my own life. I know i am not alone in my feelings and that gives me some comfort. I would love to connect with people who may be feeling similars feelings.

He's great and super sweet. they're great for each other and the three of us are going to be moving into a house together, (planned for July but now with the pandemic probably next year). My best friend lives in student housing and hates sharing her room so stays with her boyfriend a lot. Slowly she started telling me a few things about him and his family. He has anxiety and depression. He used to burn his arms with cigarettes and i've seen his scars. He's also tried to kill himself. He lives with his dad and older sister. He makes out that his dad is pretty good and not as bad as his mum but i met his dad and he's really mean to him. always putting him down and making him feel awful. His sister is even worse. Iv'e always known that I didn't know the whole picture and that there was stuff that they weren't telling me and I knew that it was none of my business. But just tonight my best friend told me something really awful. He told her this pretty recently and said that he trusts me to know. His older sister used to repeatedly molest him for years. he still lives in the same house as her! Until now he couldn't afford to move out. He once told his dad while they were fighting then he ran away for a few days and when he came back it was never mentioned again.

I am recently having a lot of panic attacks , particularly at night time. I constantly feel like I am battling a mean demon version of myself in my head. I am not having self harm thoughts instead quite the opposite. I have a severe fear of death that has come from anxiety and my precious experiences of trauma. I often have images of a version of myself like a twin who is mean and out to hurt me and make me feel scared and fearful. I cannot get those thoughts out of my head such as this frightening version of myself, images of death, hospitals etc. I am really trying to find ways to cope but instead keep suffering with panic and anxiety attacks quite severely I become so scared I am also suffering with disassociated feelings. A feeling like i am not alive and am not living in my body instead watching the world around me. I am responsive however and I get on with things. I cannot seem to get this feeling to go away, If anyone has any tips on treating disassociation please share. I have come to the online forum on the lookout for some advice , people to share their experiences on how they cope or how they are dealing with things. I am hoping to find people to reassure me I am not alone and we are in this together.

PTSD-1068,Finding myself again - escaping the narcissist - NO I'm not crazy,"My injuries can't be seen when you look at me but they cut deep to my core. My confidence and expertise in the workplace are appreciated and applauded, I laugh and chat like nothing gets to me or stresses me. On the outside I have it all. Of course I have the normal disruptions and setbacks of everyday life, but only two people closest to me know the truth. I live each day in fear that he will snap and come after me. I constantly look for him everywhere I go. Leaving the relationship was relatively non eventful (mainly because he thought I would come back AGAIN), but the non contact and extracting him from my life is the most difficult thing I've endured. He has not let go, he won't let go and has harrassed, stalked and attempted all ways to manipulate and coerce me into submission and return to his secret world of abuse. He has been relentless and comprehensive, demanding one day to remorseful the next. Endless voicemails, text messages, emails and visits to my workplace. It didn't matter if I blocked his number, he would call or message from another persons phone. He has threatened suicide if I did not do as he asked and talk to him, a guilt he knew I could not live with. This time I am not giving in, I'm stronger and have finally realised I deserve better. I deserve respect. I deserve peace. This was not love, this was manipulation in it's extreme. It's hard to talk about the daily grind of navigating this life. It's hard to know who you can trust with your experiences because you now second guess everyone's intentions and trust. It's lonely and it's scary. The control was extreme. I was not permitted to say ""No"" to him, I was not permitted to have my own opinion. I was not permitted to have friendships he didn't approve of. I was his servant. If I did make a mistake or displease him there would be consequences always. He showed love by giving me gifts and holidays but there was always a payoff or repayment of some sort. His ""LOVE"" was always conditional. Would love to hear from those who have experienced this type of abuse. Sharing experiences might help us realise we are not crazy and we are not to blame. Hoping there are people out there willing to chat. One day at a time, moving forward and never looking back no matter how difficult the day is or how much the fear invades my mind.

He even said he would move out of the family house and rent a one bedroom apartment even though there would be no where for the kids to stay. Questions- am I doing the right thing and can i cope with the kids by myself? Can he change, considering he is getting professional help? Or is is over?

I was abused from the age of 7 to around the time I started high school by someone so close to me that should have protected me. I’ve blocked that part of my life out so much throughout the years that I’ve been able to manage to live a ‘normal’ life. This secret closes in on me at times and sometimes I cannot pick myself up. To make things worse I have to endure seeing this person at all family events and pretend like this never happened to me. It’s devastating how alone I can feel. I’ve always felt like it was my responsibility to keep this secret to protect this person. I don’t want to ruin family relationships over this. It’s only the last couple of years I’ve started a path of internal destruction. I’ve hurt people I love, I’ve betrayed people I’ve kept secrets after secrets. I’m at a point where I feel like I don’t deserve to be loved and that everything is my fault. I know I need help just someone to talk to but I’m so afraid that If I go see a psychologist that it will just unlock all of this trauma I’ve hidden for so long. I don’t know how to face it. I’m feeling lost and I want to take the pain away, I feel like I don’t deserve love and all I do is hurt people I love.",Rose_T,Community Member,20-02-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/childhood-trauma-and-the-effects-later-on-in-life/td-p/455374
PTSD-1078,My depressed partner wants a break from our relationship,"I am in a same sex, long distant relationship. Usually we only get to see each other about once a fortnight.I am medicated for anxiety and she tells me she suffers from depression but I suspect it is also PTSD. We were so happy in our first 4 months. In the beginning she told me about a time she was sexually abused as a child and that she also struggles to let people touch her and that she prefers to be the giver in the bedroom. A few weeks into our relationship she was happy with me touching her. Until 4 months in when she (maybe jokingly) said that I was being selfish in the bedroom so a few days later I started being more aggressive (in a good way). She wasn't into it so we stopped. After that, her sex drive tanked and we have been on a downward spiral ever since and she would jump when I would touch her. I figured she was just super ticklish. It has taken me 3 months to realise that I triggered her that day in bed. I realised only after she we were having a great week talking on the phone every night then the day before she was suppose to come visit me, I commented on her gorgeous thighs and she suddenly went emotionally cold again. And she cancelled our visit. She said she was sick but I think she was lying to me. She told me a week ago that she has trust issues with me. But I have never understood the boundaries or trigger till now. She never communicated with me about what was upsetting her. She said she wanted to go on a break. I supported her decision and went quiet for 5 days. Then I messaged her and suggested that I come to her town next week for a coffee. She exploded with anger and said that I have blown her trust gain and that I have now ruined us and will never get that trust back. I explained that we didn't state an mount of time for the break. And then I said that I will go off the radar for 2 weeks then check in on her and that if by then she still needs space I will go away again until she is feeling better. Any advice please? Is this relationship salvageable?",Rosebud2020,Community Member,01-03-2020,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-depressed-partner-wants-a-break-from-our-relationship/td-p/469484

PTSD-1080,How do I start,"Since 2011 throughout my marriage falling apart i have lived everyday with the mindset that regardless of what happens I can control myself and make the right decisions so that nothing will break me. It turns out, by fighting so hard for so long and never giving in I didn't realise, the whole time.. I've been breaking myself.. I didn't even see it coming, or if my measure of caution raised its head it was immediately chained and boxed away. To touch on 'events' that led me down this path basically I was manipulated and controlled into a state of what I see now as resigned submission.. due to spending any money or time on anything she didn't enjoy or want.. simply bullied out of doing healthy socialising with the few friends i had, giving away all sport, dozens of threatening calls if i was only minutes late home, to her more extreme threats of absolute destitution, screaming and threatening she'll go prostitute herself out on the streets while the kids live in a cardboard box, getting eventually to the point where she would threaten me with taking the lives of our kids if I wasn't home..i endured this for 2 years getting to the point when every single day I came home from work i was sick to the stomach with dred if the house was quiet fearing what lay ahead, . Fast forward 5 years and several jobs I am incapable of addressing financial issues through outright torment, i don't know how much debt I'm in, 2 maxed out cancelled credit cards,Ive been scared to do my tax since 2013 through shame and fear, i don't answer my phone and i ignore all mail through fear..i seem only to be able to manage the necessities for the kids of house, food, car and school. I'm absolutely exhausted, frustrated, scared, sickened, confused. I can't lose my job, I am scared of going to prison and I definitely don't want any medication. My kids deserve me winning this fight as much as i do..I need to find a way to win against myself.

PTSD-1081,PTSD in a partner,"Hi there, This is all very much new to me. I was in a loving long distance relationship with my partner for 11 months. Everything was great, we had made plans for one of us to move countries, communication was great literally went from I love you to the next day she suddenly text me, yes TEXT (we are in our 30's and previously spoke about the importance of proper communication) to break it off. Said there were no issues and nothing to work out and also nothing more to talk about. Her previous relationship was extremely abusive in every way possible and I always tried to support her the best I knew. She suffered from anxiety and depression and was on antidepressants, which she later told me she was drinking a bottle of wine a night with them. She was working an extremely stressful and time consuming job where I would try to encourage her to take a break and look after herself. She had a pending court case where she would have to stand against her ex for the horrendous things he did to her. We didn't talk for 3 weeks then got back talking, she admitted to the drinking and being overwhelmed and not feeling herself and numb. I definitely felt like I was walking on eggshells and didn't want to trigger anything again. We had conversations about me moving over there which she later denied saying etc. All while this occurred it spurred up some anxiety I didn't even know existed in myself, I sought the help of a therapist to try and navigate this. She sees a therapist but never mentioned our relationship or the drinking on her meds. When I said I wanted to fly to the states to check on her, she shut down again and went MIA. I'm reaching out to see if all of this behavior sounds characteristic of someone who has experienced trauma and PTSD and if cutting out relationships when overwhelmed. I love her dearly and don't want to give up on someone if they are not at their best but also understand I can't ""fix"" her.

I was administered ECT to one side of my head the left side, as there is a permanent burn mark there for proof of that treatment.

My family experienced a number of traumatic events overseas, which meant my daughter witnessing from age 8-11: a drowning; a category 5 cyclone; my heat stroke (delirium and seizures) and later, concussion; her close friend’s relapse with leukaemia; an accident where a boy was hit by a truck; a dog’s death; a neighbour’s house fire; a Rottweiler attack; a house assault in which rocks were thrown at the house and a machete attack. I tried to get help for her at the time and after, but it was ""all in the box"".

PTSD-1085,Return to work cycle and non supportive family,Hi first post so here goes. I was diagnosed with ptsd by 2 psychologists and 1 psychiatrist. Another psychologist suggested I have adjustment disorder. All from a series of bullying related workplace incidents nearly 3 years ago. I have worked really hard to adjust to life as it is now and as a rule I am doing ok after a rocky couple of years. I have a support group around me in my hubby and adult kids. Two things that never fail to get me upset and set me back - constantly trying and failing to get back into the workforce. - lack of understanding by my siblings and elderly mother. Advice from psychologist has been to avoid family but my dad has dementia and I want to spend as much time as I can with him before he fades away. Any tips on keeping the negativity at bay about the going back to work cycle of starting again and again? Also how to deal with non supportive family? I don't expect miracles but maybe some of you can relate and have some ideas.,Thxlcc,Community Member,28-02-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/return-to-work-cycle-and-non-supportive-family/td-p/467736

PTSD-1087,Group therapy. What are people’s thoughts?,"Hi everyone. this week I’ve just started a 10 week women’s complex trauma program and I’m just wondering if anyone has previous experience with group therapy. I found the initial interview process (to see if the group would be a good fit) really great and I was super excited to begin. But since the first group session I have been completely overwhelmed. I’m sure this is somewhat normal but honestly the past week has been a struggle. My body has literally shut down on me and I’ve been crippled with pain from what I can only assume is body memories from past trauma. I’ve also been so emotional. Like it’s out of control. My housemate killed a spider and I cried all because I felt like she took the choice away from the spider about whether it wanted to live or not. I’m just at a bit of a crossroads. I want more then anything to get better and I 100% want to keep giving the group a go. I just don’t know if this is my body and brain telling me I’m not ready. I don’t know. A lady in the group actually made the comment that what she wants to achieve out of the group is how to really live and not just survive. And I feel that way too! I just don’t know if I’m going to cause myself more damage if I put myself through 10 weeks of this if I’m not ready. anyway. I’d love to hear if people have had any previous experience with a similar situation. Like I said, I am so ready to move forward in life and actually start living a life that I really enjoy being a part of instead of just telling myself I can make it through the day one step after another to then continue to tell myself this on a daily basis.

My son, who was 15 at the time found graphic photos and messages between his Dad and said women. this led to divorce...I left quietly broken and walked away with nothing but my children. 2.5 years on, he still continues to tell everyone I ended the marriage and he was crushed and he is happy he’s found love again... this of course angers his children who have expressed their concerns however their Dad has chosen his happiness with her and has not seen his children for 2 years. its hard to try and support two teenagers through University on one income... they study full time and work casually when they can. My ex says he’s “no longer obligated to support them” im financially destitute, left with debt I ran up to pay for psychology appointments when we split as my then 15 year old tried to take his own life.

PTSD-1089,I hate my parents what do I do?,"Before I start I just want to say I know my situation is no where near as bad as other kids but I could really use some help. i want to start by saying that I had a great childhood, my parents are among the wealthier people so I always had the coolest toys and nice clothes and for that I am forever grateful, but around the time I started high school is when everything fell apart. They would check my phone every night and go through my room once a week to make sure I wasn’t hiding anything and at the time I thought fair enough they’re just making sure I’m not doing anything bad but I’m 17 turning 18 this year and they’re still doing it. As my mates and i got older their parents became more relaxed but mine became unbearable to live with. I’m not allowed out past 7, I can’t go anywhere that’s too far from my house, they check my phone, my room, my phone plan usage, my bank statements and all kinds of things along the lines of that. Most people I tell just think I have overprotective parents but they aren’t like that to protect me, they do it so they can find something I’ve done wrong and get me in trouble for it. They seem almost desperate to catch me doing something I shouldn’t, last week my dad told me he wished I was never born because I left my ceiling fan on when I left my room to get lunch from the kitchen. They let my younger sister do everything she wants, she doesn’t have a curfew, she doesn’t have to hand her phone in or anything like that, and I’ve never done anything to give them a reason to. I hate them because they make me feel like everything I do is wrong, whenever I do something I worry about what they will say because they’re so unpredictable with what they will get mad at me for. Everything I do seems like an excuse for my dad to try and intimidate me and if I fight back or tell them how I feel it always ends up getting violent between me and dad. I don’t know what to do because I can’t keep living like this I’m in grade 12 and I’m trying to get the best marks so I can get a good job and move out but I’m failing and falling behind because the stress of school and my parents is too much. I feel hopeless and don’t know what to do.",Tomwce,Community Member,20-02-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-hate-my-parents-what-do-i-do/td-p/454367

PTSD-1093,Don’t no what is wrong with me,"Hi, i don’t no what has happened to me. For the last 6 months, maybe more I’ve been feeling empty with no feelings towards my kids, husband and no interest in anything. I work full time and I’m pretty busy, but a lot of the time I just want to cry. I can’t see a way out and I think I’m destroying my marriage cos of my anger towards everything. I have 7 children but only one left at home. I was sexually abused by my father from a very young age and it stoped when I ran away from home at 12. I never told anyone in my family what he had done to me (he is dead now) So they just thought I was a uncontrollable child. I was put in a children’s home because of it and I still never said a word. I was very young when I had my first child to a extremely violent man. It took me nearly 8 years to get away from him. Having 3 children to him, they suffered at he’s hands to. Then I meet someone who was a pot smoker very calm and caring not violent which I need in my life, even though I hated that he smoked drugs. But he started smoking so much that when he didn’t have any he’s moods were terrible and he’s abusive mouth was unbelievable, but I was no angel, I would abuse him back. After years of living total different lives but share the house and bed and 3 more children, I needed to get out. It became nasty and he ended up with someone else but kept trying to turn my kids against me and make as much trouble as they could for me. I ended up moving away to stop all the troubles. In this time I meet my now husband (we have been together for 11 years) who I was totally in love with, he changed everything in my life I was totally happy he was there for me when ever I needed, I told him every secret I ever hide. About 4 years ago he had a accident on he’s dirt bike. In hospital for 5days he had memory lose and was paralysed in one leg. In a few weeks he was walking properly, but had depression. He use to ring me 20 times a day stressed, angry sometimes crying while he was at work, and I stopped everything for him just so I was there for him.He is a lot better now not taking any meds But he has changed not completely but I feel it and we argue of stupid things. I feel we are destroying each other. Iv been such a strong person all my life did everything on my own, I could always rely on me. Now I don’t no what to do. I feel lost, empty, sometimes angry.

My new partner was furious and installed cameras which deterred my ex. Ever since then I have been unable to sleep well without medicine. If I am home alone I have everything turned down really quiet so I can keep listening for changes. We moved house and I thought it would be better but it is just as bad. Almost worse because this house has a lot of doors so I have to keep walking around the house all night checking locks. Because my ex and I share children I have to talk to him occasionally and see him on occasions, my partner always attends these times. I just don't know if I will ever get through it and move on.

I would like to say before I post that I totally understand that there are many people going through what iam at the moment with their friend or wifes and partners , i dont think for one moment its just me ...... My wife and I found each other about 4 and a half year ago and fell in love and got marriaged to years ago this month so known each other 5 years this November 2020 . My wife turned 60 years of age last Dec 2019 and ive just turned 65 years of age this Jan 2020 ...... when I met my wife i didnt know at the time she was suffering any symptoms that anyone else would go through after coming out of a previous marriage two years before me . I realized that she was quite spoken and very well mananned and beautiful .... but after knowing her for six months or so i started to realize there was more to her life and past issues that were effecting her quality of life .... I wanted to know more from her but soon found out she was not able to give me answers or communicate about her past at all without breaking down and crying ... she would just say I cant talk about it ... My wife was dumped by her parents at age 5 years and her 3 siblings at some children centre .. then fostered out to husband and wife who both abused her one with mental and emotional and the other sexually. The doctor knew this as well cause she had mentioned to him a long time ago .... he advised her to seek a proffesional to discuss all of her past .... it was very overwhelming for me to know about her history and Ive been trying to understand while any human would do that to anyone especially a child . So for me living and dealing with my wifes illness has been very challenging and sad at the same to to see her not get enjoyment out of little things like just waking up in the morning and saying wow ..what a wonderful day outside it is and excited about what we are going to do today..... my wife doesnt feel any emotions joy or happiness from life from those things ...... but she does get enjoyment from her 3 daughters and her grandchildren which i love to see her smile and laughter and also a lady friend she met just before I met my wife 4 years or so ago . The last 2 years Ive realized through been councelled myself that I cant make my wife happy around me if she doesnt want to be what hurts me is the fact she can laugh and smile and enjoy conversation with her daughters and her friend but not me !!!!! ........",Songs58,Community Member,02-02-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/husband-how-to-cope-caring-for-wife-ptsd/td-p/500605

PTSD-1098,PTSD and staying at work,"Hi all New here, not sure what I'm actually looking for, but here goes. I was bullied at work (I work in Prisons) and consequently broke and was off work for a year, in treatment with a Psychiatrist and a Psychologist, on medication for Depression, Anxiety, mood stabilisation, sleeping and then something to assist with the affects of the medication and mental alertness. This happened in 2013. Since then, I returned to work but it was rocky to say the least, I was mistreated through the process and the insurer needed to engage a rehab person to try to ensure I was treated right during this time. I also lost my marriage and family although I see my kids as a normal single dad, but that and financial implications has been a huge stressor. I was then diagnosed with PTSD. I've been back at work and this has been a rollercoaster ride all the way through. I still see a psychiatrist monthly for reviews. I've tried to get a new job but so far unsuccessfully. I struggle hugely with anxiety, and I think my depression is much worse than id thought, so I am often flat, no energy, a feeling of dread continually, and don't remember the last time I felt truly happy for other than like something with one of my kids, but not for like a day. Financially I'm trapped, so cant just quit. I had a career meeting with the GM last year and one thing said was I ""need to let things go, that's why things went bad years ago, so I need to let go or (suicide)"" Feel like I have no options, but cant keep going like this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Balinor,Community Member,27-01-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-and-staying-at-work/td-p/491148
PTSD-1099,So lost,"Hi I’m 18 years old, going into my second gap year. I’ve had to learn how to deal with my anxiety ever since i was 12 years old. My anxiety only got really bad when I was badly sexually abused mid year of grade 12. Every since then I haven’t been able to have any self love for my self and am consistently putting my self down for every thing I do in my life, even for things like; trying to pick an outfit to wear for a day or to deciding what career path I should go on. I just feel so lost and confused. So I spent my whole gap year last year just working thinking of what I want to do for university and for the rest of my life, I’m now into February of my second year out of school still feeling just as lost as I did in grade 12. I have no idea what to do with my self. Every idea I have about studying or doing a trip overseas, I instantly find a way to shut every idea down, by thinking I’m not going to be good enough for anything at all. I just feel like I’ve put so much pressure on my self to ‘ try figure it all out’ but I’m so scared Anything I choose to do I will fail at.

PTSD-1101,Mental health about to cost my umpteenth job,"Just an biannual performance review and my boss has called out for the third time that my lovely colleagues have complained that often, especially in the field, that ""I am not there, am somewhere else."" I cannot deny this. I always feel like I am in two levels of consciousness, one trying to concentrate on what I am doing, the other off fighting the war inside my head or worrying about something else completely different. In year 3 my teacher called me ""The Dreamboat"", not unfortunately because of my wonderful looks but by apparent disassociation with everything around me. Every whinger in every job has noticed this and got me into trouble, and fired - not matter how hard I try not to make mistakes I always do, wrong labels on bottles, typos and other mistakes in final report drafts, bad data processing and/or input. No matter how good the job is there is ALWAYS little mistakes, and these all add up and annoy supervisors and I end up fired. Held on to current job for 5 years but now after 2.5 years a second senior colleague has made a complaint that he does not want to work with me anymore. I feel angry and hateful towards them and yes, wish them ill but on the other hand I know that they are right, I just really resent them reporting such piddling mistakes I cant help feel its a personalised conspiracy. But its in my whole life. Although a good and responsible driver I often just forget or don't notice what speed zone I am in an seriously over the last 30 years all the fines I have paid out could have bought a nice new car or deposit for a house. Can anyone suggest any type of mindfulness therapy for this, or can identity just what is wrong with my mindfulness? Let's cut a long story short: I am - white Australian, 48 yo - lifetime clinical depressive/dysthymic - Functioning alcoholic and fond of legal downers - Recently officially diagnosed with Complex Post Traumatic Stress disorder - Struggling to keep my mental illness(s) from work ""mates"", recently divulged CPTSD to boss, seemed understanding, after second supervisor refused to work with my due to my ""incompletence"".

PTSD-1104,Not sure how much longer I can continue,"Hi again, my daughter is now 25. I continue to bend over backwards for her and she continues to be rude and spread vicious lies about me. It came to a crux overnight when she came home very late. My rule is if you are going to be late, let us know. It's not about control, it's about concern for well being. She hadn't spoken to me for two days and she entered the house, slammed the door and went into her room where she proceeded to yell how much she hates me. She was covering her face so I touched her hand so I could see her face. She accused me of being violent, then pushed me into the bed, smashed my picture frame and punched my back. She then ran out of the house. As it was past 2 am, I thought it was best to drive around to find her. I took her car as it was the most accessible at the time. She woke up the neighbours and called the police. She told them that I stole her car, that I physically abused her along with a litany of other lies. This is the third time that she has contacted the police is 7 years. The venom in her eyes was soul destroying. She wanted me destroyed. As all the damage in the house was caused by her, she then started to fabricate her life story to elicit support from the police. It broke me to see how far she was prepared to go to destroy me. She can be very self destructive and emotionally immature. She resents people who like me, especially people her own age. She makes up a lifetime of abuse stories, focus on me being an aggressive bully. As people cannot believe her stories, she records me when I'm really angry and having a rant at home (typically to myself). She uses this against me and plays it to anyone who will listen. I have always been there for her, even after all her shenanigans. She can either be very loving towards me, or very nasty and manipulative that constantly tries to entrap me. Her lies are baseless but the repercussions are enormous. I'm now beyond exhausted. I told her last time she called the police that if she did it again that our relationship would be invariably damaged. This affects my work, my relationships with people, and especially my relationship with her father (my husband). I always make excuses for her and many times have even taken the blame. She honestly hates me and wants to hurt me - physically and emotionally. I'm not sure that I can move on from this. I'm traumatised. She tells me that I'm not deserving to be a mother and that everyone who knows me hates me. How do I move on?

PTSD-1105,Experiencing Domestic Violence as a 16 Year Old (DV Trigger-warning),"Hi, this is my first thread I honestly don't know how to put this so I'll just type. Last year I had witnessed my dad physically abuse my mother, this was the only time this has ever happened. It has been since around 2011 when he first started verbally abusing but up until late last year he finally ""went over the edge"" since then I've gone to get professional help which resulted in me being diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and MDD. Prior to all of this I've had anxiety as I'm still in school and I'm so worried that I won't be able to achieve what I need to do what I want in the future. With school coming back in again in a few more days my anxiety has come up again. I feel lost and I have no idea what to do my usual coping mechanism would be self harm or drinking. However, tonight, or this morning I suppose I decided to come to this forum to see what would happen. I guess I've here to vent to anybody. From these events I feel guilt from not being able to stop what happened and for having my dad arrested. As a family we no longer live together and I stay with my mother. I'm finding it hard to even think about contacting my dad. I have no idea what I'd even say to him, what's worse is that he's not remorseful for his actions which hurts so much. All I ever wanted to do in my short amount of teen years was make him proud but now I can only see the evil in him. I have no idea how to approach communication with him and I don't want him to cut me off.

PTSD-1106,Sexual Abuse,"I’m new to this website, however I am in need of venting right now. When I was a little girl (roughly 6 or 7) I was sexually abused by two of my cousins. I’m not going to get into detail but I will say that considering my age, I didn’t actually know what anything sexual was. I’m 15 now and I only just told my mother and step-father about it after years of it floating around in the back of my mind and occasionally the front. It feels absolutely amazing to have it let out but because I’ve been hiding it for so long (I didn’t know what to do) and I’ve been acting normally around everyone as to not ruin the family, I feel pathetic and regretful. I used to feel at fault but now that I’m older and I know how wrong it was, I know I’m innocent and shouldn’t have been treated that way. Anyways my mother started crying asking why I didn’t tell her and I tried to explain that when things like these happen, especially as a child we don’t know what to do and feel pathetic that we couldn’t stop it or do anything. She kept blaming herself and saying she was a bad mother, however I kept denying that because she isn’t a bad mother, I just couldn’t figure out how to tell her until now. My stepfather said he is very proud that I said something even though it was hidden, and he was extremely supportive. I keep getting a sick feeling like everything is going to change. And of course it will because life doesn’t stay the same. Unfortunately because of this trauma, my childhood was cut short and I learned that the world could be cruel just as much as it is beautiful. I guess I’m just scared that the family will be ruined. I’ve always been one to protect others and put myself last but honestly I couldn’t hold it in any longer. I have school in only five days (which I am grateful for) so I will be distracted and be comforted that things will still be the same just with a few changes. I hope I become open minded to the fact that things will change whether or not I’m scared of it.",monmoo,Community Member,25-01-2020,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sexual-abuse/td-p/489039
PTSD-1107,Am I experiencing PTSD?,"Hello there, About 5 months ago I was woken up to what I thought was an aggressive break in next door right outside my bedroom window. There was lots of crying, screaming, banging on the garage door and glass smashing from the house next door. A person had died so the cries were gut wrenching screams (I wasn't aware of this until the next day). As I called the police I remember feeling so terrified as I listened to the events unfold and felt helpless. I remember begging the person on the phone to get the police out faster because the people next door sounded terrified. It was really traumatic for me as my biggest fear is to be broken into while I'm at home and I guess not being in control of the situation and not being certain that myself and the people around me are going to be okay. It makes me feel sick thinking about it. It didn't end up being randoms that broke in, so I should feel better knowing it wasn't a random attack but there is more to the story. I now have mini panic attacks before falling asleep at any sort of noise that I can hear outside, which happens most nights. My heart races and I struggle to breath. I constantly am checking my house cameras, especially late at night. I constantly check my community pages on social media and when I hear of a break in around my suburb I Google to see how far away it is. There are break ins quite frequently in the area that I'm in, which doesn't help my stress. However, I feel I would be like this where ever I live as I live out of home and now it's not my parents who would take the brunt of it, it would be myself and my partner if something happens...and this scares me. I don't know how to get over this and forget about it. I don't want to feel this way every night. I thought by now I would have forgotten about it but something about the screams and cries and initially thinking it was an aggressive break in has really triggered me.

It was a time period from roughly 4 years to 15 and a half years of age. I never sought to take this one to court. Potentially I should have. I just wanted to get away from those moments, and try and move on. I never was given the idea councilling was something I should have, so I dealt with it myself the best I could from then until in my early 20's when it became finally too much and I actively reached out.

PTSD-1109,Do you think PTSD can still affect up to 15 years following trauma?,"Hi, I am just wondering do you think it is common for the effects of sexual abuse as a 14 year old girl to impact adult life? The main reason I ask is that my parents are very recently undergoing divorce and my father strongly believes that my exposure to sexual abuse when younger is to blame for the downfall of their marriage. When I was 14 I was abused by a male friend who was invited into the family home by everyone, the followup of this event took over 2 years to go through the court system and I had a few attempts of counselling and seemed to put it behind me with avoidance of triggers (school friends, places in town, etc). Now with my father bringing this up again I have began to experience several panic attacks and am in a constant state of anxiety that is making me physically sick. I am wondering if you think it could be delayed PTSD or a more general anxiety/panic disorder?

PTSD-1110,Introducing Myself - Snoopy56,"Hi, I am 64 years old. I am divorced since 2009. I live alone with my cat, Mitzi who is 12 years old. I have suffered depression since I was very young. My childhood was an unhappy one with a father who committed suicide when I was only 3 years old and a mother who didn't know how to love. School was also hard as I was extremely shy and poor. Kids picked on me a lot. High school wasn't much better, I spent a lot of time alone. I moved to Queensland when I was 20 years old. I married and had a son. The marriage was abusive causing me to fear for my safety. It took 33 years before I had the courage to leave him. For years later I was in fear that my Ex would find me. I am now medically retired from the Police Service after being hospitalised for 3 months. I had attempted to end my life. I had ect, 12 treatments which caused me to forget how I had attempted suicide as well as what I did for my job. Since then I have been admitted into Mental Health Units about 4 times. Medication I was given caused me to appear as if I had early onset of Dementia but it was proven to be incorrect. I had tried CBT, DBT with little success. I was diagnosed as having severe PTSD after many years of seeing Psychiatrists who treated me for Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depression, severe Anxiety and OCD. I found little help with the numerous Psychologists I have seen because many use only one tool, CBT. This tool didn't help after going to Outpatients sessions at New Farm for almost 2 years. I have found a Clinical Psychologist that is treating my PTSD. I see her weekly because I cannot cope with life on my own. I didn't necessarily choose to be alone but my son has abandoned me and my nearest family member is in New South Wales. The village where I live I am not welcomed because of my age. There are many who treat me with hurtful comments. I no longer attend any functions at the village. They don't know I have Mental Health issues, if they did it would make life at the village worse than it is at present. I don't have any friends to speak of, certainly anyone to talk to when the pain from my Fibromyalgia is so bad or I can't sleep for fear I have another nightmare. I hope my experiences in life can help others who have periods of deep depression.

I don't think I know all the genises of my chaos, but I am aware of quiet a few & I have a few suspicions as well. I was abused by a friend of the family, around 6. I was hospitalised at 7 for 45 days with a life threatening condition. I felt abandoned, confused and in a LOT of pain. I was left with a turned eye, shaved head & horrific memories. I never felt like I fit in anywhere after that. I was abused by a family member from age 9 for several years. I met my husband at 16, was wooed & promised so much, married at 20, had 3 children. Over the years I was dragged down to a place where I had no self esteem, questioned my intellect, memory & beliefs. I had nothing left of me I didnt doubt. I was so ill I could barely function. I was progressively diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, chronic insomnia, PTSD, Adjustment Disorder and finally c-PTSD. I left him after 25 years together, took my 3 kids, all the clothes I could pack & 2 single beds. I couldn't drive, I could barely make myself move. I was also struggling with bulemia & walking pneumonia. I believe I was in a delusional state as I remember having ""friends"" that didn't exist. I lived in constant fear. He would come to work & spread lies & intimidate my co-workers. He would break into my rental home & menace me through the house screaming all my faults at me, trying to make the children side with him & make them come home. I met someone 18 months after I left the marital home. Eventually we moved 4 hours away from where he was. It was only after I learned that I was safe, respected & loved that my Mental Health became obviously out of control. Benign events, words, sounds would trigger me into a chaotic, nonverbal, traumatised puddle. Small things would spiral me into self loathing, fear & regression. I apologise ALL the time. Today I am in fortnightly trauma therapy & some days I feel like it might even work. I accept that I am broken, possibly beyond repair, but being mentally ill is not going to stop me living my best life. I Live with my partner who I also am full time carer for. I have two of my 3 children with me, my youngest, the one with Autism and ID, & my eldest who has bipolar & chronic insomnia, both of whom I am also carer.

PTSD-1114,advice on what to do with family members who've caused PTSD,"Hi, So on paper I look like I've recovered from a lot of my trauma i.e I have a job and study and seem functioning. But I still maintain a close relationship with my parents who greatly contributed to my PTSD and sometimes I find it hard to tell if they're the reason I'm still not getting much better. My dad overlooked my brother abusing me as a child and in present day continues to scream, swear and belittle me. When I've discussed how much these behaviours impact me he storms off and won't speak to me for somewhere between days and weeks. His longest was a year. When I don't challenge his behaviours he's a generally kind person who's fairly supportive but these outbursts of belittlement and screaming trigger past memories horribly. He also gaslights me during and after these outbursts to make me feel as if I am to blame for his anger getting out of control which I don't feel is fair. He'll also deny saying horrible things seconds after saying them which makes me feel insane. Alongside this he constantly excuses my mums manipulative behaviour. She always tries to guilt trip me into not moving far away from them (I've lived out of home since 17 but close by due to this) and says things like 'you don't care about my happiness,' 'you won't make it,' and just things along the lines of 'you're not capable enough for that'. As a child she kept me in the house with no contact to anyone else or the outside in general up to age 11 so any comments that make me feel trapped make me go a little crazy for fear of being locked up again. It took a lot for me to break free from that but I feel like the constant reminders of my past in their behaviour are starting to bring me back to rock bottom again and I don't want to lose all the progress I've made. Sorry if this is long and unclear but I'm just unsure on what to do as I don't want to lose a relationship with my only family left but I'm not sure if the mental toll is preventing me from making positive relationships. I feel like I'm slowly screwing up more at work and uni because of all this and I don't want to ruin it all before it's too late. If anyone has any advice on how to even begin managing this kind of situation it'd be greatly appreciated as I'm at a loss and losing hope.",bee2003,Community Member,14-01-2020,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/advice-on-what-to-do-with-family-members-who-ve-caused-ptsd/td-p/477389
PTSD-1115,Work based ptsd,"Hello everyone, I received a diagnosis of PTSD in October 2018. The reason for my diagnosis is from a previous job where I was exposed to a lot of family dysfunction and child abuse/neglect. I have been seeking psychological assistance for 18 months, 13 of which have been emdr and it has been incredibly helpful. I no longer work with kids or families, however my current role requires me to read intimate details of childhood abuse. This used to lead to light headedness, accelerated heart rate and agitation, which has since subsided. I do notice though that for the remainder of the day and into the next day I feel emotionally fragile, have little tolerance and notice the hypervigiliance creeping in. I can continue on with my day, challenge my thoughts, engage in mindfulness or distraction ect but something within me just doesn't feel right if that makes sense. I am wondering if anyone has experienced a similar feeling ? I should also say that I have worked incredibly hard to be in the area of work that I am and in no way do i wish to give it up!

PTSD-1116,Trying my best to receive the DSP,"Hello, This is my first time ever that I have joined an online forum regarding my mental health so I'm a little bit anxious in writing this. I have struggled all throughout my life, from early child abuse (Physical and mental) from a wicked drunk stepfather who was so intimidating and mean. I had no support back then and was always told that I was the problem and had the abuse coming to me. I was told that as a baby I used to rock myself in the cot, back and forth and at 44 years of age I still do this, Autism? I was a mute around people my whole life and still am, I hate myself so much that I can't be outside the house. I am a loner every single day and have had history of schizophrenia, OCD, Anxiety/Depression and just recently after telling my story to a psychiastrist, he believes I have Austism Spectrum Disorder, which looking back into my past, and even now, it really does make sense. Trust in other people I don't have anymore, I have been abused and ridiculed in front of people, and I have told it's my fault. I have bad OCD, but the schizoprenia is the hardest part of everyday life, the thoughts and the symptoms are there every day and night, I only feel I am able to cope when I am at home, alone. I have full backup of my GP, psychiatrist and psychologist of over 20 years to help me with my DSP claim, but I am extremely worried it will be rejected from what I've read on other people's experiences with a claim. Since April 2017, I have had a total of 10 jobs, every one I've been fired from, all from my mental health condition. I mean, how much information do Centrelink need? My entire life story?

PTSD-1117,Child Abuse and Neglect survivors,"First time poster, needing insight from other survivors. Q is at the bottom if you don't need context I've recently stopped talking to my parents because for the last 30 years they've been incredibly abusive and violent to one another. I had lived with my parents on and off over the last (almost) 30 years, when not with my parents I was with my grandparents who were very nurturing and provided me with the few positive memories I've got. I've living independent for a few years now My parents (mostly mum) was very harsh toward myself and my siblings growing up, verbally abusive and made us feel like anything that went wrong in her day was somehow our fault. We were fed, clothed and had a roof over our head but we very rarely received any love. that doesn't sound like a lot when compared sexual and physical abuse survivors, but it's still affected me nonetheless. Mum and dad were even more abusive to each other, violence occurring on occasion from both of them. Our house was the one the cops would always get called to. mum would often ask me to intervene as I was the oldest child, ask me to run next door and call the police on my dad, directly involving me in their fights. they would reset the next day and we made our way to another fight, (1 - 2 times a month). still stuck in this cycle today, a few months ago I finally had enough called it quits, ceasing contact with them for the 2nd time this year (and in my life). strangely, I miss them. but when I think of them I get flashbacks to the abuse. This has been happening since ceasing contact 4 months ago. I know I'll never go back to them as long as they continue their behaviour.. and I know they absolutely will. I'm now coming to terms with life without my parents. Honestly, its bitter sweet. I can now see the results of my childhood. I have trouble forming complex connections with people, I'm hyperventilate regarding my environment and relationships. I'm petrified of my own anger, isolating myself at the first sign of it (Im angry a lot), when I'm not angry, I'm mostly apathetic. I've spent the last 7 years numbing myself with alcohol, party drugs and weed. I've been sober a week now. My question is will I ever move on from my childhood? will I ever be able to regularly feel something other than anger or apathy? Will I ever be able to form meaningful connections with people? Will my flashbacks ever stop? how do you live a happy life when all you've known is the toxic potential of relationships? - P",PB92,Community Member,01-01-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/child-abuse-and-neglect-survivors/td-p/453900

PTSD-1119,PTSD and grief. How do people manage?,"The Christmas/new year period has always been particularly hard for me. I always feel like everyone gets on social media and tells everyone how wonderful their year was and how excited they are for the new year and all the great things it has to offer. It’s for this very reason that I’ve been off social media for the past 2.5 years. For the past 10 years I have struggled with anxiety and have really tried to figure where I fit in in life. But 2019 has by far been the worst year yet. I was sexually assaulted which resulted in pregnancy. I accepted the pregnancy and decided that I would tackle this situation head on. I have always dreamt of becoming a mother and this horrible situation was allowing me this chance. Not long after I discovered I was carrying twins. Again I thought to myself I am truly blessed because even though something terrible and unimaginable had happened this was my silver lining and like was looking up. At 13 weeks I learnt that my babies were not meant to be and I continued to remind myself that I would be ok and things would get better. For the rest of the year I have continued to fight and try and figure out where I belong. My PTSD is out of control. I get around 3 hours sleep a night if I’m lucky. Everyday life is draining and I’m trying my best to stay a float. A random smell or a image from the past sends me into complete meltdown mode. I just cry all the time. My chest feels like it’s being squished and my skin crawls with a tingling and painful feeling. And once I’m in this state it takes forever to calm back down. How do people cope? How do you stop yourself from getting into this state? 2019 really really kicked my butt. I need 2020 to be my year. I need to still find the good in the world. Coming up on Jan 17th it will be 12 months since the assault. I really hope that someday I will see how all these situations have helped me to become strong and to fight each and everyday. Because all I can see right now is my world crashing down around me. 2019 was a great year for some I’m sure, but for me 2019 tried to kill me, emotionally and physically. So 2020 had better be a winner because I know I can’t have another year like last year. I barely survived and I’m not sure I could survive all that again.",Slipperyfish,Community Member,05-01-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-and-grief-how-do-people-manage/td-p/457154
PTSD-1120,PTSD & Guilt - a combination from hell?,"Last year I was diagnosed with PTSD, depression and an anxiety disorder. I went through a massive process with my psych last year and did some amazing healing but the PTSD feels so unshakeable... I constantly am living in an altered state of reality and I can never see anything for what it really is. So often I come off as nasty and cold to people I care about but internally it's a massive mental battle. The guilt I feel for being so cold eats away at me so much, to the point where I dread people even saying hello in case I come off as a b*tch. I love being around people and talking to them but right now I'm not okay and it's so hard for me to fake it. When I was 15 I ran away from home after years and years of abuse, watching my Mum get beaten, having strange and scary people do drugs around me because I was forced to live in a dealers house, I was constantly watched and followed, never allowed to eat, I would have to sneak out of my room hoping no one would see me just so I could use the toilet or get a drink of water. I would drink about 6 or 7 cups of tea a day just to try and fill my stomach with something. When I escaped, I found myself in a living situation that was just as mentally abusive and struggled for another 2 years, constantly being watched and judged and made to feel unsafe. Now I live in a state of disconnect, even though for once in my life the house I'm living in is safe. My body is constantly tense, my heart pounds out of my chest if my boyfriend leaves the door to our room open. It takes me hours to build up the courage to go shower or make food. I'm currently living with my in-laws who are lovely but super nosy, and it sends my anxiety through the roof. Something as simple as the dad saying hello and looking over my shoulder makes me panic, and shake and feel like I'm about to get killed. My PTSD affects my every moment, every thought, every action. I feel so alone in this battle, having no one truly understand. The only person that knows I have this diagnosis is my partner and while he is supportive, he doesn't understand. I feel guilty for being so blunt with the people who offer me a safe space in their home. I'm going to try and get approved for some more sessions with a therapist in the new years because I can't carry on like this. I don't know what I'm searching for with the post. This mental disorder is a lot to deal with, I think I really just needed to vent. Any thoughts or ideas about coping would be so appreciated.",Feya,Community Member,29-12-2019,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-guilt-a-combination-from-hell/td-p/448461
PTSD-1121,Recovery after car accident,"Hi everyone. 1 week ago I was driving home and I blacked out. When I came to I was in the back of a ambulance. I didn't know where I was. The ambulance officer said I had been in a accident. He said the car veered across 2 lanes of traffic, hit a light pole and hit a brick wall.He said I was lucky I didn't hit anyone else or killed myself. I was taken to the hospital and while I was there my brother turned up and I broke down. They ran the tests and everything came back clear. My brother took me to his home and then the rest of the family turned up. They were asking all sorts of questions but I couldn't think clearly. I told them I was tired and needed a rest but they kept on asking questions. I got really upset and got up and stormed outside. I walked to a bustop and caught a bus back into the city and went home and went to bed. The next day I went for a walk and found myself in the area of the accident and nothing came to mind. I started walking back home when all of a sudden I felt faint. I made it to a bench and sat down and just started crying. After I had finished I got back home. I checked my phone and had about 20 messages from family members asking me to ring them. I ignored them. The thing is that since the accident I have slipped into a depressed mood. I can't stop thinking about the accident and how lucky I didn't kill anyone else. I need to find a way to get out of this slump. Can someone give me some advice. Thank you Anthony.",Brisguy55,Community Member,05-01-2020,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/recovery-after-car-accident/td-p/457266
PTSD-1122,Lost after leaving mentally abusive relationship,"Apologies for the length of this post. I left my narcissistic partner nearly 4 years ago. Have been battling in court for 3.5 years over property settlement. Has been huge fight including fighting the ex-Ptrs lawyer cause they did not pay the bill so a warrant of sale was placed over my house where myself & my kids live. Ex did not comply once with anything. Has made false reports about drugs in the property, that my son is selling drugs, of child abuse against my daughter & has now even threatened to cause issues at work so I get sacked. Property settlement is finally done just recently with orders I am to pay the ex out & retain the house. I now feel lost as it would appear the bank may not finance me, I can service the loan on my income but due to how much I need to borrow they may not approve it. I have been beaten down so many times since leaving not to mention the 20 years with the ex of being mentally beaten down. I feel so lost & like my last 4 years fighting were for nothing. I have tried so hard to remain positive & focused, to keep looking for light at the end of tunnel & now I am done. I do not feel like I can continue. I have no fight left in me & do not know where to turn. I want to just crawl into a hole & never come out. I am beaten & do not feel like I am worthy of ever being happy. Every time I feel the slightest happiness something happens to break me down again. The moment I feel I am finally moving forward another hurdle is thrown at me that I have to fight & jump through hoops to get passed. I can’t take anymore of it.",NMS_broken,Community Member,03-12-2019,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/lost-after-leaving-mentally-abusive-relationship/td-p/499196

PTSD-1124,NPD dysfunction over long term,"Hi, I grew up with NPD father & have suffered greatly over my life. My first method to protected myself from the incured emotional & mental damage was by hanging with extremely violent people who no body would dare mess with. I'm an adult now & realise that kind of thing isn't the answer. But it was the best I could do as a teenager who just assumed that NPD was a normal part of life caused by white-picket-fence lifestyle giving men too much power. I swore off ever living that life & upheld the promise. I had an extremely hard life from the damage incured during childhood. I never wanted or thought I'd make it past 30. But I'm now 41yrs old...So I guess you could say, I'm a survivor of NPD but my unborn children are not. I didn't even know about NPD until a week ago & have never sought help...the label helps - but also makes it hard because of the realisations. I found the label after seeking help in dealing with my partner...he's also NPD like my father. Even though I survived NPD (lived past 30) = it's still torturing me & inhibiting my input into life. One of the biggest challenges I deal with is some kind of self worth thing (?) which affects care for myself...I don't think doing things for me is worth it. I have to trick my mind & do it for someone else...but not like a slave (that was my Mum to my NPD Dad)...I've modified it. I'm ""saving life on planet Earth"" working as a research scientist & teaching permaculture. But recently I've hit a block & it's not working anymore. Sometimes I can hardly get out of bed. I don't want anti-depressants, anxiety treatment, not even the promise of sorely needed money can give me the motivation. Another challenge, is some kind of fear reaction (?) where I can't focus on what I'm doing because my BF has me on my toes...demanding & harassing. I am not a teenager anymore, I can't go find a big friend to growl whenever he treats me bad, then go live with a friend. This time, I have to find a way to deal with it or work through it. I can't move out until I save the money. I live rural with 2 horses, 2 cows & a dog...it's no small move. Please help. And thank you for all who do. You're making a real difference in my life & I'm so very grateful.",ChrissyStar,Community Member,24-12-2019,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/npd-dysfunction-over-long-term/td-p/443660
PTSD-1125,Hi Anyone else with PTSD have panic attacks for no reason? *Trigger Warning*,"My psychologist says i have PTSD well CPTSD and I have been through some traumatic stuff, oh um *Trigger Warning* I was groomed from a very young age and sexually abused by my narcisstic father for 6 years from age 12 til 18 when i went to Uni, at 15 I also witnessed a girl be seriously physically assaulted at The school bus stop, at 19 and 21 was raped different guys and just recently cornered in an office and verbally abused by my Boss who thought I was incompetent and falsifying my timesheet, he since apologised after trying to do my workload after I quit but damage was already done I can't go back to a place i no longer feel safe. So I don't have flashbacks I don't remember dreams so no nightmares im aware of, I can talk about what graphic stuff I do remember in an aloof manner with as much emotion as flipping through an aldi catalogue, but truth is most of the time unless i have to see my parents i give it very little thought at all. But I have days when i feel so agitated and on edge but nothing has happened to trigger it, I can be washing the dishes and my heart starts to race my vision blurs i cant breathe properly. OR days I seem to be frozen and cant leave my bed my eyes glued to my phone tuning the world out. The anxiety and panic attacks seem to get worse the older i get. When I'm anxious my brain doesnt function properly from using the wrong words to not being able to answer a simple question at all so naturally I get angry. Yesterday my husband asked a question and took three steps towards me and I reacted like he was going to kill me severe panic and screaming at him to get out of my face (he was still 3 metres away). I am lucky he is compassionate and understands its not a rational reaction on my part and I am not scared of him logically speaking obviously my brain is slower realising that. I always told myself I didn't want to be a victim being all woe is me won't get me anywhere seems denial hasn't worked out in my favour either have all the problems with some weird detachment to it as well.

We have had a toxic relationship from the beginning. This was my first real relationship and I believed he was the one. But abuse snuck in and I put up with it. My two suicide attempts have been triggered by his lack of love and lack of caring and understanding. He has been hot and cold. I thought he was strong enough, and insisted he was, to help with my depression, anxiety, OCD and adjustment disorder. He then changed his tune and said it was too much and couldn't see a future with me. He is traumatized and has PTSD due to my attempts.

PTSD-1127,Domestic Violence and fires,"So thismorning the Police turned up knocking on my neighbours door, for the umpteenth time this week, due to domestic violence and abuse. And there is a LOT of alcohol being drunk too. The woman, I think, is the main drinker and the main offender. There is an adult male and two children, I think in their early teens. My neighbours door, by the way, is only about 15 feet away from my door, as I live in a block of units. And all the fighting and stuff takes place pretty much at my door, about 10 feet from my bedroom window. Last night, as well as the DV incident that took place before Christmas, both started at around 11:30pm. Last week, just before Christmas I had called triple zero twice in about 10 minutes due to a major incident happening. I could hear children crying and begging someone to stop doing what they were doing, and adults yelling absolute obscenities at the kids and each other. It was so awful, and I was still shaking the next morning. Anyway, back to today, and as I was walking out to check my letterbox for a parcel I’m expecting, the Police were walking up to the neighbours door so I said to them “Can I please give you some information to pass onto them?” And they said yeah sure. So I went back inside, and grabbed an AA flyer – the 12 question one that is headed with ‘Is AA for you?’, an Al-anon bookmark size flyer, and 2 printouts for rehabs. Both rehabs, mind you, are an hour and a half away, in opposite directions and there is no rehab here in town. Which is crazy because this town where I live is, in my opinion DESPERATE and WELL QUALIFIED for a D&A rehab. Anyway, so that’s been my morning and week. I am so, so, SO glad I got sober. SO glad. I NEVER EVER want to go back to drinking. Ever. Oh, and by the way, it feels like pretty much the whole damn country has wildfires. Not doing great with that either, being a wildfire survivor. Got some PTSD stuff happening and flashbacks and stuff. Not such a great week here. I'll be okay though. It could be worse. And for a lot of people right now, it IS far worse for them than it is for me. I do hope the police pass on the AA and rehab info to my neighbours. I think these people need all the help they can get.",Soberlicious96,Champion Alumni,31-12-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/domestic-violence-and-fires/td-p/449658
PTSD-1128,"It feels like it has been so long, why is my trauma still impacting me so much?","I'm new here, and I'm not sure where the start, so I guess I will just write what comes to mind, unfiltered. More than 10 years ago I was raped, by a friend I knew and trusted. I reported the incident to police, however, no charges were ever made, I attended counseling early on, but I know now that I was not willing or ready to work through what I had experienced. My partner at the time was sympathetic, but not supportive and my coping mechanism was to bottle things up and ignore feelings. In the years following my rape, I experienced many symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I made life decisions perhaps in response to these symptoms, and it feels like the trauma completely tipped my life off balance. Fast forward ten years, the sympathetic partner I had when the rape occurred is still in my life, we were married, had two children and separated in less than amicable circumstances at the beginning of this year. I have since met a new partner, and things with him have been amazing. However, when I entered into a new sexual relationship it seems the trauma resurfaced. I began having terrible nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety attacks and a general feeling of unrest. I sought counseling and was open and honest with my new partner about my past. He has been supportive and asks what he can do to make things better. As the relationship becomes more serious, and the feelings become stronger I have so much fear. I am still having nightmares on a very consistent basis and the last two nights, the person depicted in the nightmare hurting me is my new partner. I feel as if I am constantly trying to make sense of what is going on in my brain and where these thoughts are originating, what are they revealing to me, or what am I feeling deep down. But it is a maddening loop. I am finding it very difficult to open up to this new partner and tell him what I am thinking, or what I need because I can't make sense of it myself. At the root, I feel it may be some very deep seeded trust issues. I just wish someone could tell me what is going on in my mind, that I am not losing it, and how to make it better. I feel exhausted.",inthenight,Community Member,30-12-2019,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/it-feels-like-it-has-been-so-long-why-is-my-trauma-still/td-p/449085
PTSD-1129,I am old now. and i just dont know where to write this,"Gosh there is so much to talk about and i just wish to put it all in words It started wehn my sister and i where 6 and 5 respectively. One day mom and dad sat us down to explain we will have a new mommy soon. We were kids and too this day i do not know the reason for it. i was just sad that mommy was goping away, early that morning mom woke us and we fled states, too live with gradma. i had started school by then, but i was always upset after that, i failed to make any friends in the new place, and just fell behind in school. I never cuaght up. Im sure there was legal battles over custady right, and some time in grate 6 or 7 i spent a year living with dad, his new wife and her three kids. This was my year of hell. My step mom just did not plain like me, i never understood at the time, but now i believe that she saw me as some kind of threat too her own security. And she started forbidding me to return home after school, without my father, So at abotu 10 years of age (i think) i would wait around the ferry pier for my dad to return from accoss the harbour at about 6-7pm each night so i could go home That essentially left me roaming the streets, alone, and very sad. for 3-4 hours every afternoon. It so happened i chanced on a man, who was very kind too me, he would talk too me, play chess with me, and buy me icecreams. But he also did other things too me, things that a child should not experience. And i just, dreading it, went along with it, let him do what he wanted cuase he paid attention too me, and bought me icecreams I tried to tell Dad, a few times, not about the man, he was my friend. that my step mother never let me come home after school. They would have fights, i could hear it, and her kids would call me a ""home wrecker"". But Dad just casually passed it off too me as ""i thought you just liked greeting me"". So im old now, and ive never talked about this, ive never moved on with my life, its been wasted.

PTSD-1130,Living in fear,"Hello, Just over a year ago now my partner of almost 8 years just left said he wanted a break, didn't want to be with me anymore. This broke my heart. All I kepy thinking in my head was what I did wrong, how can I fix this, I would have did anything for him. Not long after he left I found out he had been cheating and dating someone while he was still woth me. He left to be with her. What makes things worse is while all this was going on I found out I was pregnant. To be honest I wasn't happy. I felt like I couldn't be. I was scared and he couldn't care less. I had no idea what it was like living on my own again let alone doing it all while pregnant. Not long after this his new girlfriend got pregnant also. When I say I died inside I truly did. All I ever wanted was to be withis person for the rest of my life and have this wonderful family with him yet he meets this girl and does it all within a few months of dating her. Was I not good enough, did I waste 8 years of my life caring about someone who could so easily forget about me and everything we did together. To make things worse again his new girlfriend was sending me horrible messages pretending to be him saying he never wanted to have kids with me, he never loved me and I am a joke. She goes out of her way to text me and look through his phone to make sure I am not texting him even if it is just to ask if he wants to spend time with me and his son at the park. This texting business only stopped a few weeks ago after she was mocking me for being depressed when he left. She even blamed be for his depression saying I am the reason he always feels like crap. I can't believe he sticks up for her every time. I let him come and see his son every day. I have got him fathers day presents, made him gifts from his son and invited him to so many outings so he can spend time with his son but it is never enough. He threatened me today with going to court. It isn't the first time. I have panic attacks when I go into town I get so worried I am going to see them together with their baby and it just takes me back to this really depressing place where I question myself why am I not good enough to have my own family. Why does my son have to live in this broken home. He told me to grow up and get over and what he did in the past. Believe me I tried but it hurt so deeply I don't think I ever will.

I endured 12 long yrs with this person who did not love or respect me in any way shape or form & the trauma from the daily occurrences has given me severe PTSD type symptoms, i now have regular panic attacks with the thought of him coming through the front door so i hide in my room as when the feeling comes over me i have to lay down as ive been close to passing out at times. The straw that broke the camels back was when he announanced & laughed infront of me to a friend, that in his eyes i resembled a 414lb woman (i gained 10kgs after loosing my young mother to a brain aneurysm so gained a dress size or 2 due to depression) i couldnt take it anymore, he made my skin crawl with his personality traits, the list of things that made me question my sanity of why i was with a person like that is so long & involved that i cant possibly write it all down. As i write this i am waiting for him to arrive home to pack his items up as hes moving out, i feel like ive escaped the 12 year prison of unhappiness i was in & immediately entered another prison! Most people have said to me that i should be happy with him moving out, well of course i am but im left completely on my own with ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF LOOKING AFTER MYSELF....I WASENT ALLOWED TO WORK.....So i cant find a job as i have NO EXPERIENCE, NO SKILLS AND NO QUALIFICATIONS & on top of that im turning 40 this year so they wont consider me due to my age so im terrified & dont know who to turn too! Ive also never been allowed to have any control with finances, or make any decisions in the last 12 years. I feel so completely overwhelmed. Ive also gone from him earning a very lage amount of money each week (3 to 4 times higher than the average wage) to being drip fed the tiniest amount each week to live on until i find myself a job which is extremely difficult when i cant apply to 98% of jobs so im in panic mode right now with 2 kids to support.

PTSD-1132,My husband's severe betrayal and the workplace that knew..has left me with PTSD,"I was married to my best friend. I adored my husband - loved him immensely I thought he was a man of integrity, and for nearly 19 years thought he went to work in an environment where he was appreciated and respected. I also thought his work colleagues respected him because he was married and, I assumed he spoke highly of me as his wife. I was severely deceived and betrayed and had no idea. I was caring for my mother for some years. She suffered from severe anxiety, AMD and dementia. I also have some chronic auto-immune health issues. She died in October 2015. My husband, I thought adored and loved her. But after she died, he left me suddenly, five months after her passing. I had NO idea. Suddenly, this monster emerged, a man I had loved and respected. I found out later that I was the 'joke'of the workplace and he planned to leave me by cheating on me with another woman in another country and planning on exist when I was deeply grieving my mother. I had absolutely no idea all this planning and deception was going on behind my back, while I was busy planning a funeral and grieving my mother. I was also mentally and physically exhausted after many years of caregiving. My husband was well respected by friends, my family and our church community for over 20 years. He abandoned me and I discovered later that his work colleagues knew what he was planning and were supporting him. I am not sure if they knew my mother had died or not I assume they did as he took time off work for her funeral. I was the 'joke' and the joke was on me. I have suffered with severe PTSD since. My husband divorced me, I lost my home, my dignity and now live with confusion wondering who this man is and what part of my life was real with him.. I have little or no support. I have pondered..should I contact my husband's place of employment and tell them what he has done and what others had done in helping planning this horrid joke and that they had done this on a woman who just lost her mother and was in deep emotional and physical pain and exhaustion. I know, it's nearly been four years but I feel as though it may help relieve the PTSD. I don't want them to let my ex-husband know though. Or, do I need to let this go, not say anything and try and heal of this PTSD myself?",lantern22,Community Member,24-12-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-husband-s-severe-betrayal-and-the-workplace-that-knew-has/td-p/443264
PTSD-1133,Ageing women value,"I’m hoping I won’t offend anyone with my post ad I realise what I’m thinking is a product of my experiences and thoughts but I’m really having trouble or getting past themsince a very young age perhaps 9,10 I recall older men being inappropriate towards me . A man exposing himself , many many inappropriate comments , leering , sometimes ‘accidental touching , then at 11 sexual ‘relations’ from a 17 yr old boy That went on for a year or so . I’ve never known what to make of it as he wasn’t technically an adult . I have raised it with a couple of counsellors but both were reluctant to say much . I’m extremely angry and tearful when I think of it and ashamed . I went completely off the rails and into abusive relationships from there anyway , my issue is I have zero trust in men and a huge obstacle believing I could ever have a real relationship , even though that’s what I truly want , because I believe deep down all men truly care about and want is youth. All my examples in life have confirmed this in both my personal experience and friends around me . I hate porn as In my mind it confirms mens obsession with youth and beauty with older women being relegated to a fetish .My closest friends tell me that men on dating sites their age block women their own age even though they say they don’t want children in their profile and I read that men’s optimal age for a partner for their entire life is 22 even through women prefer men within a few years of their own age . Apparently that survey was taken from over 200k people so it’s not small I look around me for some examples to try and give me opposing views and think ok I’ve found a man standing by his wife then I find out he left for a 21 yr old ....I just feel women are only valued for youth and looks and so discarded and that any of a relationship of you didn’t get it right in your youth is decreased for a woman just because she losses the thing men value most . I feel like I’m permanently damaged . I mean if I can’t be through these thoughts by this age . Everyone else is living in the same world as me and either doesn’t see these things or isn’t bothered by them so there’s clearly something very wrong with me and I don’t seem to get anywhere talking to therapist . In another thread a psychologist was suggested but I’m apprehensive as my experience is no one wants to hear this ... o guess I’m venting and wondering if anyone has ever felt this",Goldenribbon,Community Member,18-12-2019,PTSD and trauma,14,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ageing-women-value/td-p/436869
PTSD-1134,Recently diagnosed with psychosis from PTSD,"Hi everyone! this is my first post on this forum, I have been in intensive therapy for a bit over a year, last year I was hospitalised for a suicide attempt as a result of my depression and anxiety, along with my developing psychotic symptoms. I am doing a lot better than I was last year, but recently I was officially diagnosed with psychosis, and it's taking a toll on me. I have used up my therapy sessions, but I don't think I want to return to it for a while because I think I can cope by myself now, but I'm just looking for a bit of support on these forums. I had an extremely bad acid trip on new years a couple years back, and I've never felt the same since. I have 1st episodic psychosis and PTSD as a result. It drives me nuts.. I'm often very paranoid, and I have slight auditory and visual hallucinations, though nothing too extreme, it makes me feel like I'm going crazy. I feel dissociated literally 100% of the time, and it makes my work life and social life quite difficult. For example, I get confused about my surroundings, it feels like I'm looking through a screen all the time, like nothing is real around me. It feels really scary but I'm just trying to accept that this is my life now. Sometimes I get so confused that I don't see where I'm going and I might walk into someone or something by accident. My vision is always fuzzy, and I can see halos around people. I know it sounds crazy, and I know it's just my illness but it gets so tiring having to act normal around people, like I'm not experiencing anything. I guess I'm really scared of this developing into something like schizophrenia. It would be reassuring to hear from people with psychosis or a similar experience to me. I feel there is so much stigma around it because people think you're crazy or will harm others because of it, which isn't true at all. I also have really bad depression and anxiety, and I have panic attacks a lot simply because I get anxious about the possibility of getting anxious. It's so draining Anyway, sorry if I have rambled a lot but I'd just like to get some reassurance that I'm not alone and I'm not crazy.",lazycalm,Community Member,13-11-2019,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/recently-diagnosed-with-psychosis-from-ptsd/td-p/469704
PTSD-1135,"Sexual Assualt, mental health, full-time work, support?","Hallo BB community, I am reaching out for advice. I experience very extreme ups and downs caused by complex trauma from childhood sexual assault. I went to a music festival in Nov 2018 and experienced assault again and haven't had a grip all year, I started a new full-time job thinking a fresh start would distract me but ive had multiple break-downs and seriously embarrassing emotional days. I have recently applied for counselling and cognitive behavioural training through Victim Services but ive seen two psychologists in 6 months and really don't feel like they've helped. My mum keeps telling my it'll take time but I am burning out. I have spiralled AGAIN> displays of aggression to my boss and total anti-social behaviour with colleagues leading up to it. Felt like I was experiencing bullying all year and told myself I could talk it out with people before the holidays. A lot of the time they work in pairs and I never felt considered. I must have been too confrontational because I have been given a warning from my boss about it. Im really disappointed in myself for not handling it, im an only child and I think I take these things too seriously, I was so embarrassed and didn't know what to say to anyone. I feel sick and pathetic that this is how I feel. I talked to my GP about it and he gave me a 3 day medical note and said it sounds like everyone at work is stressed. Ive worked really hard all year and he knows I have. My boss wanted to know what was wrong with me, hes really old school and makes all the woman at work uncomfortable so this was really hard for me. I told him my GP says im stressed, he asked for a diagnoses, I said complex trauma, he said that has nothing to do with work and if its affecting me then I shouldn't be in the workforce and he would like to know so he can replace me. I want to crumble. I don't want to find another employer. I want to sit with myself and accept the world, study at tafe and do volunteer work for the planet. Does anyone know where child sexual assault victims stand under disability payments from centrelink? I don't feel like ive healed at all this year. I feel so tired and angry.

PTSD-1138,PTSD from an anaesthesia awareness trauma,"I was diagnosed with PTSD recently due to a traumatic event when I was 2.5 years old and its been the most horrendous and strangely empowering journey. Memories that we block usually come back, however hard we try to keep that door locked tight. I realised that my body was always trying to remind me of what happened but I always stopped it until last year when, during an incredibly stressful period at work, those memories refused to stay in that black hole any longer. My trauma was what they call ""anaesthesia awareness"" and happened during a tonsillectomy. It has been a lonely journey because there is very little information and support for people like me. I do know that a lot of sufferers commit suicide and I can understand why. Sometimes it felt like I was tiptoeing through a minefield, defusing bombs (memories) and wondering if the next one was the one that would blow up in my face, the one I didn't survive. For the first time I was afraid to go to sleep because I naively believed that I could control my memories/thoughts while I was awake. Yes I thought of suicide, because trying to escape internal pain can sometimes make you feel like that is the only option. It isn't but it can seem like a blessed relief until you realise the pain it will cause your loved ones. It gives you the strength to get through one more day, and then the next... I'm lucky I guess in that the panic attacks come in the middle of the night and so don't affect my work. This trauma affected me in so many ways, a personality was created out of unbelievable terror and I wonder if the innocent little girl is still in there, the one who doesn't know fear and can feel joy and freedom with that fear constantly lingering in the background. My way of coping was to try to control everything around me, I felt it gave me a false sense of safety and when I got older, alcohol - it made the fear go away - temporarily at least. The trauma stopped me having a family as I couldn't be around young children, they terrified me and if they were upset or screaming it was even worse. Maybe its because it forced me to remember a little girls' internal screams that no one could hear.. My journey isn't over but I am getting closer to the end with the help of a wonderful psychologist and an amazingly supportive husband. I just wanted to say if anyone else is suffering from a trauma and internal pain that is threatening to overwhelm you - please don't despair - there is help and there is hope!",Chelle72,Community Member,24-11-2014,PTSD and trauma,14,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-from-an-anaesthesia-awareness-trauma/td-p/77362
PTSD-1139,"CPTSD & Bipolar, but still trying to smile.","Wow, would you look at that. I’ve reached out for human contact... Hi guys, I’m a 29 year old mother of three. And clearly I use humour or sarcasm to mask my true emotions... sigh.. Anyways I thought I’d post my first time and introduce myself to others who also have similar MHCs. I have been on a long journey with my mental health and it began when I was a child. Being sexually abused for 10 years til the strength to make my way in the world. However due to trauma, a lack of education and a rebellious streak I didn’t seek the help I needed til much later in life. When I found myself homeless, pregnant and alone. I endured many years a single mother, made some poor decisions had the worst luck when it come to my decision regarding my partners. I ended up suffering a great deal of violence, both physical and sexually in natural, in my early twenties. I managed to free myself after years of torment at the hands of the biological father of my youngest child. I’ve been in a safe, new home now for 2 years now. Just started to see my doctors and have my medicines fixed up. I still have really shit days. But today was a good day. I seen my psychiatrist and spoke about making a new plan to manage my bipolar.

PTSD-1140,"Experiencing immense grief, sadness, loss, loss of hope and angry over family.","Hi, I am an adult survivor of Childhood abuse and Trauma. I was abused by both parents growing up well into my adult years. I am now 40 years old. I let go of him (male family member opposite to a mother) I cannot even say the name. I let him go just after I turned 30 years old. I finally realised it was not my fault that my father did not love me. 18 years of my life completely wasted. It took me roughly ten years to deal with the grief, loss and abuse. It was so so so hard. I did not go to counselling. In hindsight maybe I should have but cannot be undone what is now done. I still have some things to work through in regards to him but nowhere near as much as my two remaining family members, her ( again opposite to a father) and my sister. I have made a choice that when he passes away (not that I will find out probably) that I will not be going to his funeral. He did not want me being alive, so really he does not deserve my farewell or respect. I already said goodbye to him. I know there is no chance left nor hope of ever having a relationship. So I have said my goodbyes in my own way. Sometimes it still hurts, like when I am going to do something that any daughter would love to have him with them and I feel sad for a moment. I guess no matter how much work I do there will always be a small part of me that feels a pang of sadness sometimes. I don't acknowledge Fathers day and I don't acknowledge his Birthday. I just get on with things. 5 months ago I left a same sex Domestic Violence relationship.Nobody knew I was in a Domestic Violence Relationship. I still have that to heal and recover from. When my remaining family members found out, I was not even going to tell them, My sister never did a single thing, not one single thing to help me or support me. My mother came to court with me once and I will not say what she did that day, I will just say that after many many many years of severe abuse and trauma from both of them, something inside of me said NO MORE. It was a real strong NO MORE and I meant it which changed my whole world. So to cut a very long story short, I am currently in a place now where the hope has died. I held hope for a long time. Hope for the family I needed and wanted. I have come to realise neither of them actually want to change and that is why my hope has gone. They don't want therapy and it is all about them. I am in therapy. I don't have any friends so I have no emotional support or people to talk to.

PTSD-1141,"Feeling trauma, grief, shame and a never ending headache.","I am sorry it is going to be a bit long but I would like to share what I am going through. I was in a long distance relationship for 4 years with my best friend from school whom I knew for 8 years. Things got a bit bad 2 years ago when I found another charming girl here in Sydney but quickly I realised that I am doing something wrong, broke up with the girl and admitted it to her, obviously she heartbroken broke up and left me, I . The depression, guilt and shame completely crushed as I bunked uni classes and went behind a semester and thousands of dollars in Uni debt. I BEGGED for her forgiveness. A few months later she came back saying she has forgiven and wanted to spend her life with me. All things went fine for the next year albeit a few difficult days but things were going alright. She broke up soon before our wedding and then kept me on hold saying it is still a break. A few days ago she called me up and said she has found someone, which killed me. I made one last effort to sway her mind but it was to no avail and was instead abused for my mistakes. Meanwhile all this while, I was so concentrated on the relationship that I have fell so far behind in life, went into credit card debt of 10k and a mediocre career. I have had this headache for the last 2 years which won't fade away, and an intense feeling of guilt and shame (no one likes a disloyal person) which has developed in Insomnia and affects my day to day life. I have this array of unresolved emotions where I don't know what to do, also I did not look for any friend all these years and feel a lack of a support system. I don't know what I want from this post and it doesn't show the whole story either as it is too complex with my financial instability and responsibility towards family coming from a migrant background.

PTSD-1143,Heart shattered to bits.,"I wrote a ""letter email"" to my mother this morning. It was painful and I cried. I wrote to get to advise her that I had decided to cut contact for the time being. It is the second parent I have had to cut contact with. I did my father ten years ago. I didn't even tell him I just cut contact and have not looked back since. I didn't have any support and did not look for support. This however I know I need to instead of trying to do it alone. In my letter to my mother I named the abuse and some of the incidents of abuse she inflicted on me. The abuse went on for 33 or 34 years. One of those numbers. That is a very long time. I told her how the abuse made me feel and I told her how much damage it had done to me and my life. I told her that I have wounds and scars for life. I told her about the things I have never been able to do, still cannot do and may never be able to do because of the abuse. It is not possible for me to heal fully nor make a full recovery. I do wonder if anyone will love me even with my past. I know I will never find myself in another abusive relationship again, I just wonder if someone healthy, loving, kind and good will be able to love me or just see me as ""damaged goods"". I told my mother that the abuse was not my fault and that there are no reasons or excuses that justify the abuse inflicted on me over the years. I told her about the flashbacks I live with. I told her that she was never there to support me when I needed her the most. I told her that all I had ever done was love her. I would like to talk about the abuse but due to the rules here I cannot. I do not want to speak to someone from beyond blue via phone or via the online support chat. It is a trigger for me so I do not wish to. So here in the forums and 1800 respect is all I have for now. I told her a lot more that I cannot cover here. I also said that I could not promise when and if I would ever be in contact again and I would not put that pressure on myself. I told her that I would not be responding to any emails. I had to work through so much fear before sending it. ""What if my mum did something stupid""?. ""Is she strong enough to cope with this""?, as she is getting older now. ""How will she cope""?. I had to feel guilt and like a bad person for hurting my mum with this email. All of it my conditioning growing up. I knew that, it was just hard to see past it to send it.

PTSD-1144,From back pain to brain pain,"Hi there, I'm new and this is so out of my comfort zone but here goes. I'm in my early 50's & live by myself in Vic with my 2 rescue dogs. I stopped working mid last year because my back pain had become so severe that I could no longer walk more than about 5 minutes so I had back surgery in January then another surgery 3 days later after my right leg went numb and they discovered a blood clot. From hospital I went into rehab for 2 weeks with lots of hydro and physio before coming home in a back brace, my best friend come from interstate to look after me. I then commenced rehab as an out patient desperate to get feeling back but have given up on that about 2 months ago as there was no improvement, although I am persistent and continue the same exercises at home. My expectation was that I would be right to get back to work by March at the latest and here we are in December. My right leg, foot and both inner legs are still numb,I have rolled both ankles and sprained my right knee - walking is painful and scary, I have fallen in excess of 10 times, usually a rolled ankle and a few bruises. Feeling completely useless and overwhelmed my physio & rehab suggested that I see a psychologist and i have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and started medication in June. Seeing the psychologist has brought up alot of emotions that I had carefully hidden away, particularly a serious sexual assault and a lot of physical abuse and now I am afraid of leaving the house and cannot see any future for myself. My back pain is exhausting, the pain killers cause me gastro issues and it is all becoming too much. I have been questioning why I would continue living like this since May and as the days pass nothing improves and there is no joy or happiness. I thought that the medication would take this away but I have already had it changed, increased - doubled, and the feelings are the same. I've now found myself in a terrible financial state after not working for so long and am terrified that I will lose my home if I cannot get better and get a job. I'm receiving income protection but that doesn't even cover my living expenses so I had to drop my private health insurance along with many other things.

PTSD-1145,Sexual harassment,"Hi, this is my first post... I don’t really know how to say how I feel in the simplest way but this year has definitely been hard. It started with ongoing sexual harassment from a number of bosses at my work, For months I brushed the inappropriate comments etc aside as I was there to do my job. But one day one of my bosses cornered me upstairs and I didn’t know what to do. Currently I’m in a sexual harassment case with these bosses and although I feel I’m doing the right thing and making sure other girls don’t go through what I’ve been through. I seem to feel like I’m not fully in reality anymore, I go to uni, work and go to the lawyers every once in a while to sort out the case but I feel like I’m in auto pilot mode and not feeling 100% myself and everything is a blur. I used to see a psychologist when I first started the sexual harassment case and I was diagnosed with situational depression and anxiety. My psychologist however, didn’t support me with how I wanted to go ahead with the case and pretty much gave me handouts on how to breathe during an anxiety attack and I didn’t feel like her approach to it was helpful at all and I felt like I wasn’t heard. I know I should go and find someone to talk to again but it’s having to re-tell my story that puts me off. I don’t like feeling vulnerable and I don’t like feeling like I’m weak however, im noticing that I’m tired all the time even though I have an okay sleep, im restless and it’s hard for me to stay focused, when I’m driving I’m constantly looking out and worrying that my old boss is driving his car and he will see me etc. I know most of what I’m saying is all over the place sorry to whoever is reading this ! But I guess I’m feeling alittle lost on what to do, I feel like I know in my heart I’m doing the right thing, but I also feel that what I’m feeling is minor compared to others so I feel like I don’t need to do anything about it and I can handle it on my own. I hope the case doesn’t take too long, I hate feeling like I’m alone in all of this, I have amazing support from my family and boyfriend , but I feel it’s me against 3 grown men, one of which is old enough to be my grandfather... it makes me sick to feel I’ll have to see them again and I know I’ll have to deal with that when the time comes, but it’s also hard to feel confused and if the way I’m feeling is normal or if I’m just overthinking things.

PTSD-1146,Chronic instability/ moving house growing up and the repercussions now,"Hi I'm a 22 year old guy and this is my first post on these forums. I wasn't sure which section to write this in but I think at least what set off my mental health problems is rooted in the trauma I experienced primarily in my early teen years and teen years in general. So this is where I decided to start. Let me go over my past as concisely as I can. When I was 11 I was in the last term of primary school. Coming into my final term of primary school, my mother impulsively decided to pack up our lives and everything we'd known and move interstate for a new lifestyle. We sold most of our belongings or put them in storage and within a few weeks of chaos we were driving up interstate against our will for mum's new life. Due to the word limit I'm going to greatly summarise the next year and a half of hell that was my and my siblings life. So we moved interstate with no long term house arranged to move into. We literally arrived at a short term holiday accommodation with just our suitcases to spend the next 6 weeks until my parents could ""figure it out""... They didn't. I spent the last term of primary school at a school where I knew no one. We had to move again shortly after. I started high school a term late and then left a term and a half later after barely making friends. We became essentially homeless, and due to a bizarre combination of factors, we were moving all over South East QLD, from temp accommodation to temp accommodation, in dodgy units that could barely fit us. I had to share beds with my brothers or sleep on a blow up on the floor. This went on for at least 6 months. Packing up our suitcases and taking trains to another unit or apartment every week at most. During this period we moved roughly 26 times, no exaggeration. And I missed the rest of grade 7. When we finally settled for a few months, it was after another failed start at school that my panic attacks and dissociation started. I'm at the word limit and have left out a lot of detail and haven't gotten into my future issues but initial responses would be appreciated as to whether this counts and trauma. I can tell you as a 12 year old, I was stressed and scared all the time not knowing where we were going next and waiting in the cold sometimes at night at train stations for my parents to find somewhere to stay.

PTSD-1148,PTSD - using new DV rental legislation and anxiety,"Hi Guys looking for some practical supportive help. I have severe PTSD having been in a physically and mentally abusive relationship for 10 years (2 years out) I left after a number of severe physical altercations almost cost my life. thanks to the support of friends and my therapist I have relied on the new Dv legislation to move out of the place I have rented for 5 years as my ex keeps causing issues. I didn’t feel strong enough to move but my therapist and I agreed it would be the most positive thing for me. My problem is this. I move in 3 weeks time however the landlord in that time wants to come in so she can see what she needs to be done and has started giving my number to tradespeople. My anxiety having strange people in the house is overwhelming and I find I am triggered in certain circumstances. I kind of want to help the landlord out and be obliging but the stress associated is awful and I’m worried if I’m difficult that they will find any reason to withhold my 3k bond which I could really do with. I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or not. If I should just oblige and get on with it. The landlord herself wants to turn up at 6pm in the evening which I find stressful as I now work almost full time. My history dictates a necessity to clean almost obsessively and to be honest I’m exhausted, my home is full wit half packed boxes and the thought of having anyone here is overwhelming. thanks in advance for listening and posting any tips or advice that you can think of",SandyO,Community Member,22-11-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-using-new-dv-rental-legislation-and-anxiety/td-p/480070

PTSD-1150,Reaching Out...,"Hello there, this is my first time in ever reaching out for advice or people who may have experienced similar problems in there life. So to begin i'm 26 years old and as far back as I can remember I've struggled with some kind of Stress/Anxiety/Depression although I've never been diagnosed for any of these conditions due to troubles with GP's and any kind of referrals for mental health I've had that i will touch upon. I mainly go through fazes of the 3 issues I have mentioned sometimes like lately they affect my day to day life such as not being able to eat or enjoy time off from work and etc, this can go on for weeks at a time were I feel a constant dread in my stomach which has made me sick on occasion by not being able to stomach foods or drink. This can easily be triggered for me by work, even the most minute things cause this (I.E maybe I felt I didn't smile at a customer enough) and I can go home in terrible bouts of anxiety to the point of shaking sometimes. The majority of my stress is work related, I have this deep rooted fear of being fired although I have worked for my current employer for 5 years and truly I know this isn't a likely scenario but the stress for me is uncontrollable. I suffered this stress all throughout my schooling life too and I was always a constant victim of extreme physical and psychological bullying which I don't think I've ever fully overcome, touching upon receiving mental help I know that would be the first thing anyone is going to tell me to do I have this feeling of it not being the answer as during my tenure at school I was sent to 2 different physiologists/counselor who were both considered of high degree. The first was early in my high schooling and she told me that ""the boys who are doing this to you come from broken homes so its not there fault they do what has been done to them'' which never quite sat with me right, it always made me feel as this was all my fault. The second physiologist/counselor who i saw near the end of high school after an incident were I was followed home by the same boys I had dealt with for 5 years assaulted me to the point of being hospitalized, fearing to leave my house for weeks after this incident she only ever spoke of her sons happy life, every session told me how happy he was? I never understood this maybe she thought this would help me? In my 26 years I've lived in constant fear only on brief occasions have I ever spoke out about this, maybe someone can share some advice?",Leone39,Community Member,25-11-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/reaching-out/td-p/483864

PTSD-1153,New- trouble leaving a domestically violent relationship,"Hi, I recently left my bf, I felt it was verging on DV. Things moved very fast and after only a couple weeks I was spending every night with him. He asked me to move in. He had a list of things that were my job in the relationship- breakfast and dinner every day, sex and general house keeping. I didn’t really like this but I wanted it to work. He asked me how many men I had slept with. I lied. It’s not something I wanted to share. Things turned sour. He became obsessed with knowing the truth. He would question me repeatedly- to try to catch me out. When my story didn’t match, he threatened to end the relationship. He made up stories that he heard I’d slept around and did drugs-to see if I’d admit to sleeping with more guys. We had a cycle. It would go well for a couple weeks. Then he’d bring up me lying and we’d argue. He starting to go through my phone and read my messages. He drank every night (bottle of vodka), he’d swear at me and call me names. He would apologise and then treat me like a queen the next day. He would belittle me, threatened to cheat on me if I didn’t spend every night with him or if I didn’t have sex with him every day he’d find someone else who would. I was starting to feel that I was never good enough. I ended up leaving after he kicked me off the couch and I fell on the floor because I wouldn’t let him go through my phone. I moved out the next day. I msgd his ex gf who said he was abusive and manipulative- it didn’t end well. After I left he was apologetic. He admitted to being at fault. He sweet talked me. I thought I overacted. He did lots of kind things for me. I saw a psychologist (I’ve had 2 sessions). He told me to be careful of him. That his behaviour is that of a sociopath, what he was DV- emotional abuse. Even though I was told this I couldn’t let go. I felt guilty for moving out. I continued to msg him and then going on dates again. I continued to see him (2 weeks now). I thought him quitting drinking he’d change. He told me tonight that he is done and doesn’t see a future with me anymore. I feel he has manipulated me. He couldn’t handle I left him so for him to be back in control he won me back just to end it. I feel insecure and have low self-confidence. I don’t know why I’m crying and still want to be with him? I’m trying to figure out if our relationship was real, if he genuinely had/ has feelings for me or if it was all about controlling me? I feel as if I’ve made this into a big deal.",Nat777,Community Member,17-11-2019,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/new-trouble-leaving-a-domestically-violent-relationship/td-p/473472
PTSD-1154,"Feeling depressed, lonely and unsuccessful","Hi all, Hope you all are well! I am Kuan. I moved to Victoria 8 years ago. I am feeling really useless and unsuccessful in comparison to my peers. I was made redundant 3 months ago and I don't know which direction I should go and stick with. I feel very lonely and depressed all of a sudden and normally it isnt this bad given my current circumstances. To be honest, I feel like I survived life because I have always been really lucky in terms of being born into a high-income family. However, I have never been happy when I was growing up. I knew I was gay when I was 4 and felt I was somehow different from other kids my age. I suffered from dysthymia and anxiety because I was severely bullied from Grade 1 till I graduated from high-school and by my family too. I never had a real friend when I was a child. My social circle consisted of rich people's kids, arrogant and rude. When I was 13, I was sexually abused by a classmate until I was 15/16. I never told anyone in my family. I wished that my life would end at 17. It didn't because I thought to myself that i could make it. That one day, I will be loved. So i decided to study abroad, hoping that I could meet a guy who would love me. I met a guy who turned out to be a cheater and discovered he was having sex with another guy. I kept all of these in me for years while I pretended I was okay while I was with him. I was too afraid to lose him so I let him abuse me over and over again until a friend of his encouraged me to leave him. I did.. but i never felt better. I met all these friends who ended up finding ways to hurt me and they were actually happy that I was hurt. That just kept reinforcing my perspective of people. Now even I have a wonderful boyfriend, I still can't wipe my past away. Why? because I feel so useless in my life. I told myself I could surpass them and I could be happier. But I keep failing.. and recently I am diagnosed with ADD which explains so much of my behaviours and my sensitivity towards my surroundings. But usually people are diagnosed when they were younger. I feel like i've lost so much time that I can never make it in life and my experience with people are not helping at all. I've been seeing a psychologist but because I lost my job I really dont know how long I can see her for. I don't know anyone else who are like me. I can't connect with me. I feel skeptical about people and I feel maybe this time I won't make it, that finally I have no more energy.

Its messed with my head and my life along with my mom's accident and trauma from her loss of limb all at once, was like a smack in the face.

PTSD-1156,Struggling with my family --- (trigger child sexual abuse history),"Hi there Lately I have been very upset at my family because they no longer believe I was sexually abused when I was 9-12. Initially they believed me but because my abuser is a doctor and he has told them about the ""creation of false memories"" and how my alcohol problems has likely affected my pre-frontal cortex = I should not be believed. This is a load of bull as I clearly remember the abuse and have never forgot it. I do drink too much, but not daily, and my liver enzymes are not elevated, to help create the picture. Anyway, just being in their presence - regarding my mum & dad - triggers me, and makes me feel angry and I want to abandon them - but I love them. It just feels so toxic and I feel lost. I really does hurt that he has the ability to change their mind, it's like he has abused me all over again. I am a professional too, but because I am not a doctor - I rank further down the line, in my parents eyes. In actual fact - I think they don't want to believe he did this (he has been accused by others too), and they do admit that they don't want to believe. Thanks for listening.

PTSD-1157,An open introduction - I'm an open book after all.,"Hey there all, I will start with a bit of traumatic history, I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse that lasted about 8 years. I was raped by my first two serious boyfriends in my teen years. I thought I had finally found a decent guy with my ex-husband, but it quickly turned ugly 6 months into it. He began manipulating me, psychologically, emotionally and mentally abusing it - triggering flashbacks and making me feel absolute putrid claiming ""I liked being abused - every minute of it"". I ended up breaking free of him but only after agreeing to leave our daughter with him (rather than being homeless with a toddler) - he still has her and won't let me see her, she's now 11. I was homeless for 3 years, turned to alcohol for comfort. I couch-surfed, barely held grips with my reality, went out clubbing every weekend - then I got pregnant off a one night stand... oops. I was still homeless at that point. My mother took me back in (my ex was living with her til 2 months prior - yea don't get me started on the fact I was homeless and he wasn't) at 8 months pregnant, by which point I met my current partner. Was originally diagnosed with depression in 2008, and the Doc said I was most likely suffering since I was 11 (when I learned I was being abused). Knew I had it by then, but refused medication as I just had a baby and was breastfeeding. Got diagnosed again in 2015 and she claimed I had ""Chronic Depression and Severe PTSD"" and I am now on antidepressant medication which works for the most part. Up until today I hadn't known about Complex PTSD but it seems to fit my symptoms and trauma more. Is there such thing as having a double form of PTSD? I haven't had the best trot, and occassionally my partner reminds me of my ex which triggers flashbacks - had a full blown attack last night, the worst in a long time. I so tired of being tired and unmotivated. I have 3 daughters now, my ex still has my oldest as I mentioned, and I have my 7 year old with ASD and my 5 year old with Down Syndrome. They can be great, but draining to look after. Anyways, that's my god-awful story. Look forward to meeting some people. PS.

PTSD-1162,Feel like the universe is punishing me,"I need to be blunt - I genuinely feel like the universe is out to make my life as awful as possible. I have cptsd from 18 years of abuse from my family and at 19 I was abused by two both friends after finally escaping my family. This year I cut them all out but my family situation is worsening. What’s pushed me over the edge is my psychologist who has done nothing but minimize my trauma, try to make me reconnect with my abusers and has ruined me so much. I feel like a hollow of a person and I truly feel hopeless for the first time in years. Everytume I try to improve my life something happens and ruins it. Last year I had a wonderful therapist but because of the actions of my abuser I lost her. I’ve tried so hard in therapy to do all the homework but at this point I feel unfixable. I feel like my issues are too much and I can’t get the help I really need. If it wasn’t for my partner I’d literally be completely isolated in all this everyone else in my life blames me for my abusers actions and everyday I feel closer and closer to a nervous breakdown. My whole life I’ve had to restrain myself and hold myself together to function but I don’t want to anymore. I feel like if I had a full on breakdown and lost control of myself I could finally defend myself from abuse and would finally be seen as actually needing help. I want to go on a rampage and destroy things because having a complete and visible meltdown feels like the only way for people to care about me. Therapy has become a major trigger for my ptsd it makes me sick and tbh the reason I didn’t drop my therapist earlier was because I’ve Been using it as a method of emotional s*lf h*rm. the things my therapist says are so eerily close to my abusers that I think I subconciously felt i can’t escape it so I kept going to therapy. My boyfriend has been helping me so much but I feel so guilty like I can’t complain about therapy when I willing kept going back. I just feel like my trauma can never be fixed and I’ll never get the help I so desperately need I want to give up on trying to get better I want to scream at the people who have done this to me I hate it I hate everything so much how does the universe expect me to cope???

PTSD-1165,DV situation,"Hi everyone, Im new here and just trying to grasp at anything that will give me some strength and support at the moment! I have been in a relationship for 6 years with someone who I now am not even sure I know. By all the behaviours he exhibits, the things he says and does...I can only conclude that he is a narcissist. I really don’t want to believe it as that means everything we had was not real...it is a hard pill to swallow to find out the most intense love you have felt is not actually real, that every wonderful dream for the future doesn’t exist anymore. over the last 6 years I have become a shadow of my former self...I have depression and anxiety symptoms and I just feel total defeat and hopelessness much of the time. I function like a robot 90% of the time. I do what I need to do, my kids are looked after, but it’s like I’m not really present and everyday tasks make me want to cry with exhaustion and frustration. the thought of the future without him gives me crippling sadness (strange I know) but also having to deal with him as an ex for the rest of my life is something I don’t feel like I have the strength for right now (we share 1 child). bottom line is I am quite a smart girl, I can see everything he’s doing to me and around me, I catch him lying and manipulating me and others all the time, and I rarely even bother to confront him anymore. I have learnt that no matter how much evidence I can provide he will always react with rage and turn everything on me! Or he will breakdown, admit how flawed he is (usually with excuses as to why) and tell me how I am the best thing since sliced bread. Only to repeat the process at a later date.....but I keep staying or taking him back. I know I can never be truly happy...or be in control of my life, and emotional state as long as I stay with him. I don’t even believe his professions of love and adoration anymore, but I still really desperately want to be able to believe them! i also feel overwhelmingly sad and sorry for him, the life he has lived and the life he is going to live in the future. The despair and sadness and self-loathing that I have seen from him almost matches up to the amount of anger, lying, manipulating, violence, antisocial behaviour that I have witnessed. I guess I’m just waiting for my time where I will feel truly done and would love to talk to others who have felt this kind of grief and confusion in the meantime. thanks in advance",mum4x,Community Member,27-10-2019,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/dv-situation/td-p/441764

PTSD-1170,Stopping the nightmares,"Hello Beyond Blue, in March 2017 I was involved in motor vehicle accident. Though only a small one as someone cut in front of me with NO under cater or anything. The light changed from green to amber the person in front slammed her breaks on that hard the front of her dipped while the rear of the car went up in turn I had to do the same thing, on a nice wet road. The point of impact was 39km. Her car came out with just a few scratches n dints while the front of my car just folded like a tin can. I later found out the this little gas part that makes the airbag go off was faulty and didn’t go off, it was an older car (2000 Mitsubishi Magna) I previously had a back operation a yr before I was all cleared to go back to work when this happened. That date has stuck into my head as I was taken to the hospital and found out I had broken my lower back (L5-s1) which was the weak spot prior to the accident. Today I’m still on TAC, now suffer from Depression, PTSD & Anxiety oh and sleep apnea due to all the nightmares I keep having due to my PTSD and use a CPAP machine. I’m currently seeing a psychologist which is helping me A LOT. I’m walking still which is also awesome, but like many other have had many good days & many bad days, with pain and not been able to work. All I did was play Xbox n watch Foxtel feeling sorry for myself and NOT THINKING OF PEOPLE AROUND ME. February 1st 2019 is also not a good date for me either as I hit rock bottom and did the unthinkable!! (I self harmed) I was in this very dark place and didn’t even know I did it at the time. To this day I still have bad thought but mostly on my down days. But thanks to my very loving family and talking about it has helped me so much. My point is there is ALWAYS help out there. Just because your a man doesn’t mean you have to be big n tuff and hind your emotions!! Talk to a family or friend that you trust. Make a phone call and just talk about how your feeling or want to just get something off our chest. ITS THE BEST WAY!!! I’ve learnt it takes more of a man to talk about your problems then to bottle them up like I do, but I’ll still currently learning not to bottle things up, TALK OPEN TOUR MOUTH. It’s the best way.

PTSD-1171,My diagnosis of PTSD.,"A week ago my psychologist diagnose me with PTSD as well as anxiety and depression. It has been strange to get my head around it and understanding this has been hard, specially because I don't want to tell anyone. Since I was young my mum was emotionally abusive towards me, putting a lot of her emotions on to me,filling me with guilt and shame, as well as expecting me to help her fix the problems she was experiencing through my childhood. In a way she resented me for issues with my dad and her and my sister manipulated me for years,. About 3 years ago I moved from my country to live with my dad in Australia, I was 15, and since he acted in a similar manner to my mum; overly controlling and manipulative. The change of countries has been the most shocking thing that has happened to me, combined with my negative household life, I started experiencing very intense feelings, specially anxiety and depression. After 2 years of dealing with panic attacks,increasingly dark thoughts and getting into drugs and alcohol, I started seeing a psychologist who has helped me deal with my life in a better way. A month ago I decided to leave my dad's place for a couple of week, once he started to become mildly physically oppressive, however he took this opportunity to tell me I was no longer welcome to live with him. I've been living with a family friend since; and it has been amazing to experience an stable household. However, my anxiety is been very present this past month, I have a constant feeling that what has happened in my life is my fault. Everyone around has been extremely supportive of my situation and I'm very thankful of that, but I don't feel like I deserve that. I feel like I'm exaggerating the situation . I feel alone, I've been pushing people away and been awful to people I truly care about. I have exams in 2 months and I can't deal with everything. I don't want to be a burden to the people around me as I know they have their own lives and I don't want to bother them specially because I feel like I'm exaggerating the situation. As for my dad, I don't want to see him right now, that is awful of me but I'm not ready to be his 'friend'. People have traumatic, scaring experiences that lead to them experiencing PTSD. I don't think what has happened to me is enough to leave me as broken as I am, and for that I hate myself deeply, but I have no other option than to keep going.",Lunaluz,Community Member,29-09-2019,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-diagnosis-of-ptsd/td-p/473518

PTSD-1173,Losing faith and hope in the world,"Hi there, I am really struggling at the moment. It almost feels like I’m drowning. The last 3 months have been horrendous for me. (I’ve had a horrendous life thus far, with psychical abuse, sexual abuse, trauma) but recently I feel like it’s the worst it’s ever been. My mum got diagnosed with a terminal illness, and I am a carer for her. Then my Aunty committed suicide a few days after her diagnosis. Then recently my grandfather passed away and he used to abuse me, and I had to plan his funeral and it got on top of me. Then recently I found out my brother has relapsed and had ice induced psychosis episode. I am finding it tough with everything going on every day. I find it hard with my partner because he’s got so much going on in his own life. I feel really lonely and struggling. I feel like I can’t catch a break. I work part time as a manager but I am struggling with that, as my boss is always fighting with head office, and vice versa. I just feel like I try to get it through it all but it just gets harder. I see a psychologist and my GP regularly and take medication for my anxiety. But it’s just something happens everyday and I feel like I’m drowning. And then this last week I’ve drank quite a bit and made myself sick. Just trying to escape. I can’t meditate as my mind wanders off. I just want a normal life. I want my mum to be around for my 30th, I want her to be around for all the big life events. They gave her 12-15 months and that was 3 months ago. But she’s not responding to treatment either and the tumour has grown. I had to plan her wedding to my step father and that was yesterday and it’s just sooooo much I’ve had to do. And I just think what can I do to get through all of this. In a safe way. Where I’m not burnt out and not exhausted and angry and hurt. Sorry this is probably just a huge rant. I don’t even know what I’m asking for.",Hope3110,Community Member,26-10-2019,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/losing-faith-and-hope-in-the-world/td-p/439969
PTSD-1174,Struggling,"Hi I am 24 and 10 years ago I was groomed and sexually abused by a student teacher at my school for almost 2 years. Afterwards I was raped by a boy from my college who was supposed to be my friend. I never told anyone until a few months ago when out of the blue I was triggered. I've been struggling with feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, grief and heartache ever since. I don't enjoy the things that I used to enjoy and I've lost touch with friends and family members. It hurts to say, but I feel jealous of them because of the success and vitality that they seem to have, which I've never been able to create for myself. As much as I've tried to lead a full life, over the last 10 years I've gone through patterns, usually in winter, of falling into depressions where I've been unable to look after myself, maintain jobs, friendships and housing. But every time I've fallen I've always picked myself up. However this time things feel very different. I'm seeing a psychologist who is helping me learn emotional intelligence so that I can control my anxiety. I'm also trying to look after my diet and I'm trying to get exercise, vitamin d and 7=8 hours of sleep everyday. But, despite everything, I still feel like I'm alone and I don't know how to live my life. I want to know how others have coped in similar situations?

PTSD-1177,Stopping flashbacks and thoughts after counselling,"Hi I've recently started trauma counselling for past abuse. I felt I had no choice but to seek help from someone specialised in this, as when I broached it with my regular pyschologist I felt judged. I've posted in the psychologists and therapists etc forum separately on the issue of my psychologist. Anyway, last week's session was really challenging. We did some grounding. I left. I felt ok. Two days later I had to confront my psychologist, then that night I got a concussion and ended up in hospital overnight. The day I got out of hospital I had a really bad trigger on the way home and ever since, I am stuck in this loop of shame, self-hate, depression, so anxious and just all flashbacks and so many emotions. Yesterday I sought help from my GP who sent me to mental health to talk to them. They were a waste of time. By the time I got there I had to wait in ED coz the acute team was gone. Which made my anxiety so much worse. And now today I have to deal with the ever critical MIL who has nfi what mental health even is. I just get so angry and I hurt... I just want to stop thinking and feeling.

PTSD-1179,"Do I have BPD (Trigger warning - references to self harm, abuse)","I was wondering if I have BPD. I have been seeing a psychiatrist since I was 20 when bulimia, depression, and anxiety became severe. I have a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety disorder. I’ve never told anyone including my doctor how I really feel inside as I feel ashamed there is something wrong with me and I don’t feel I can trust enough to tell anyone. I keep my feelings hidden from those closest to me as I am confused by them and unsure if they are valid. My mother had me when she was very young and was quite unstable with substance abuse and volatile moods for as long as I can remember. I was alienated from my father when I was about a year old until later in life. Among other traumatic experiences when I was 12 my mother's boyfriend at the time was volatile and did drugs and also sexually abused me. I told my mum but he lied and said I was mistaken and she believed him. When they split he broke into our house and terrorised us one night. Within the year or less after this I remember I started bedwetting and hurting myself. I remember being so angry or upset and hurting myself was the only thing that calmed me down. This reduced after time but as I got older I started binge drinking and having problems with anxiety, depression, and bulimia. At that time in my head whenever I did something that I was ashamed of or binge ate would repeat “I hate myself, I want to die”. With time, CBT, and medication I have stabilised, and rarely drink or have problems with eating but still have occasional relapses of depression and anxiety. I often feel lonely and empty. I also feel numb a lot of the time but other times I also feel emotions are overwhelming, especially anger. One thing that confuses me is when my husband goes to work I feel so angry at him, I feel he doesn’t care about me and that I can’t trust him (I don’t tell him this) but when I am with him I wonder why I felt that way and feel guilty and confused for being so angry. My doctor hasn't mentioned BPD. I am distancing from my mother under the advice of my doctor, due to enmeshment and emotional abuse. I feel similarly with my mother - at times rage and resentment towards her and then guilt and confusion at my feelings. With other relationships such as my father if I feel I am getting too involved or close I get scared and untrusting and worry that they will hurt me and then I push away. I guess I am trying to make sense of the way I feel and see if I can deal with it.

PTSD-1180,Complicated past issues,"Hi I think I have a complicated past. I'd like to think I have since moved forwards. Married w 3young children. However, I do poorly on my own and my anxieties, insecurities and feelings of abandonment play up. I sought help before and was diagnosed with dysthymia. Was on medication for awhile then stopped. I have been to counselling before too. I thought to share my story because I don't really talk about the past anymore. Why should I? But generally because I am stay home mum recently out of job, I find I disconnect easily, slip too easily into routine, prioritise everyone else's needs before mine and I think it is the disconnection and low feeling that now makes me see... since the death of my mil, that maybe I'm not quite ok. So apparently I was given to my grandmother to look after the first 9m of my life. Now with kids, I cant imagine doing that to my children after what we now know of baby/mum attachment, skin to skin etc. Then as a child, my dad molested me and tried to rape me and warned me to keep quiet. Eventually I told my mum after so much fear. It was the telling that made him remorseful. My mum sort of blamed me, she didnt at first believe me. I was sent away to study overseas as a result. My dad considerd hus vasectomy as 'punishment'. Police never contacted. Mum warned me to brush it under the carpet no one needs to know because my dad had changed and wont do it again. This is all pretty dysfunctional in my view. I have a series of poor dependent relationships before I met my husband. I smoked, hung out with poor company, I cheated on my exes. Then I met my husband, I gave up smoking and now have kids, walking the straight and narrow so to speak. I do yearn for my carefree days and feel tired and tied down most of the time. Now my parents are supportive of me, mostly my dad, he helped me last couple of weeks but mum and I don't have a good relationship still. Mum just finished chemo for lymphoma and my mil recently died a sudden death. I have fallen into an anxious cycle and got back on here... and I just want to let things out. My husband returns tomorrow and we still need to process grief.

My wife is trying so hard to keep me grounded and to understand and help as much as she can, I broke down and admitted to her I was sexually abused for about a 13 month period when I was 12-13 years of age and have not been able to close that box since, it has completely consumed me, our son had an incident when he was a couple of years old and I thought I was going to lose him, from that day I have not been the same. I started having nightmares, became easily angry, my therapist has said that this incident was the straw that broke the camels back so to speak. Once I thought I had lost my son everything from when I was a child came back, not even when I close my eyes, when they are open, awake, asleep, whilst at work, at home, driving....at all times.

PTSD-1183,"Childhood emotional abuse, wanting to hear how you have helped empower yourself","I have just identified that i have some issues as an adult, which i didn't realise may be attributed to my childhood, i am in my 40's and thought I was fine but i am not. My mother was abusive to me as a child, she used to destroy our belongings, particularly things that were of great value to us, an example was she would ask you how much you liked this particular item then snap it's head off and i remember her doing this around the age of 5 or 6. She was not nurturing and was constantly enraged and would throw things, break things etc, i guess we learnt to tip toe around her or hide. As an adult she has periodically been abusive, with behaviours that i cannot understand myself. I believe she has a mental illness that was not diagnosed or has not been disclosed. In this situation as grim as it was, I was very fortunate to have grandparents that took the pain away by nurturing, loving us and making us feel like we were the most important kids in the world, this i believed has helped me be somewhat strong although i am weak in other ways. I am afraid to stand up for myself to people that are in positions of power, so work wise this has been a struggle, particularly with situations when people have bullied me. I have identified that i flee if things get too heavy as this is the only way i can protect myself. I am working with a therapist at the moment and this so far has been helpful but through therapy i really feel flawed. The therapist asked me to say to my younger self ""what would you say to that young girl"", my answer was "" i could say nothing, there is no way out"". I am in early days of therapy and i look forward to going, but i am wanting to hear how have you empowered yourself when you were afflicted by the things that i experienced as a child.

However, my sister's turned on me ( been drinking and I guess stressed) and they beat me up. My son had to pull them off me. My kids and I ended up in hotel as I was scared of my sister's. I was in shock as we were close and this has never happened. I'm the youngest of 5 kids. Anyway. The night I left dad died. I never got to say bye. They blanked me at his funeral and left me sit at the wake on my own. Never said bye when we left to come back here. My man just stood and watched. I guess she was in shock too. I didnt8do anything wrong. I did all cooking and shopping. I think they hate me cos I left UK. I don't know but I just can't get over it. I lost my dad, my family then 2 months later I lost my job. I've never been out of work for 26 years. I feel I am lost . I put on my smile but I'm dying inside. I am moody, cry, get angry. Not good for my kids.

PTSD-1185,Insult to Injury,"Hello, I am new to the forum and not used to discussing these topics. but I am going to try.. Maybe someone could offer some advice which will help. I am in an uncomfortable situation where I allowed myself to become dependent on someone. Mostly this is ok and we have a calm relationship but there are some incidents which usually revolve around discussions on family. My partner is foreign and emigrated to Australia and recently told me his parents were visiting from northern Europe and would arrive the next day. It was a surprise and he and his family had been planning for months. His parents are very sarcastic, rude and literally everything they say to me is intended to be cruel. I try to be polite and the situation leads to stress which boils over. It did last night (his parents are not staying with us but invited themselves over yesterday) and after they left, without having eaten all day, I drank and became angry and had a fight which escalated. I live in a rural area but with another house on the property and very close by. We do not have too many discussions with the neighbours as they are inconsiderate. My partner and I are generally very quiet and last night our fight was one of the only times we became loud. I was yelling ""Ow Ow Ow"" as he assaulted me and this morning as the two children next door were on their trampoline they appeared to be mimicking what they apparently heard. Kids can make all kinds of noise of course but this seemed pretty specific and I know their mother has encouraged them to make fun of me before. I feel horrified that a fight escalated like that. I know that I need to improve my situation but am also remote, don't have a car besides the one my partner takes to work and and am probably dealing with children making a mockery of domestic violence. I am sure this situation will pass but I am ashamed. To leave the property I need to pass the other house and it seems that the people there find this funny. I generally look like I have my life together I think, even if I don't but I hate to think anyone could find a bad situation so funny. I do not have a relationship with my own family or too many people to reach out to as I live in a state which is new to me and I basically manage the property we're on. Is there anything I can do to keep my head up? Leaving is not easy in the short term and while I do live here I want to block out what is going on.

PTSD-1188,Gentleman Struggler!,"Dear all, This is my first time visiting Beyond Blue. I have got to the point wherein I feel I need to meet others that also struggle. If you don't mind, I wish to share my story. I have been married three times! My first wife was abusive, both physically and mentally, and after numerous years of trying, we separated. We went to marriage councillors and they could not help, as she was aggressive and refused to believe that she was doing anything wrong. She struggled with her own issues, due to her father being a violent alcoholic. After we split up, she took her our two children and moved down the road. After 6 weeks of us splitting up, she moved a new man into the house and told the children they had to call him 'Daddy' now. This was incredibly difficult and confusing and resulted in a lot of disagreements. She fell pregnant to him that year, whilst we were still married, and then told me that she was moving to NZ with him, and i could either stay or come over. I had met someone else in that time and was a year away from finishing a contract as a theatre director so decided to go, as I did not want to be without my children. When my children left for NZ, I was devastated. I sunk into a very deep depression and struggled to work and socialise. I missed them so much and could not stop crying. The woman I met tried to comfort me and during this depressive state, I asked her to marry me, which I should not have, as I knew I was not in love with her, but I needed something else to cover this feeling of sadness. I married my second wife and then we moved to NZ. I was back with my children and happy, however, my first wife was horrible and controlling and dictated everything, making my 2nd wife and I miserable. My first wife then said that she wanted to move to Melbourne, which we agreed to. My 2nd wife and I moved over, and the agreement was that my children would be moving over in 6 months. They never arrived and are still in NZ 6 years later. My 2nd wife soon got pregnant, however, we were not in love and she left Australia and took my baby daughter back to the UK. That was in 2014. I do not get to see her. I then received a lawyers letter saying that my 2nd wife and her new partner had been arrested for child abuse. They had beaten our daughter. I did not get custody and my 2nd wife was apparently rehabilitated. I struggle with my past and would really like some help or advice or meet others with similar struggles.

But I’m needing advice and I’m not sure where else to turn 2 years ago yesterday was when I was first sexually assaulted. It was after a date I went on with someone I met from tinder.

PTSD-1190,Brain zaps,"Hi, Im 56 throughout my life I have suffered with depression from early 20's until now. I have recently been commenced on a new medication which has helped in some ways for me, but my dose was increased (10 days ago)and last night (now 18:00)I experienced a 'brain zap' at least I think that was what it was. I was in a deep sleep and woken by what felt like a jolt of electricity coming from inside my brain through my forehead. It was very distressing and greatly concerned me. I can still actually feel where it seemed to hit my forehead. All the reading I have done says that it is a side effect coming off some medications. I have found nothing that anyone has shared about it happening to them increasing the medication dose. I am sort of happy with the way I am feeling on this medication( at least on the smaller dose and prior to this experience) I know from the experience of commencing this medication that the side effects dissipated for me about week 4 (now week 5 and 3 days) I want to give the increase dose a chance, but the way the zap impacted me has made me fearful about going to sleep. It was that frightening. I live rurally and am on Newstart, attempting to get my things organised to apply for DSP. My GP is a 160km return trip and I see my psychiatrist(whom I have to see via Psych2U on skype once a month for half an hour and am not scheduled to see for just under three weeks. ) I only began seeing a psychiatrist as my Psychologist is not a Clinical Psyhcologist, so for DSP I have to have a report by a psychiatrist. I am not that happy with the psychiatrist and my GP is aware, as the psychiatrist asked me how work was, even though known that I was on Newstart, and then suggested I consider moving into an over 55s retirement village.(my worst nightmare) This psychiatrist is in Sydney and it appears he has no idea of reality of life in a rural remote area, nor does this psychiatrist have any understanding or made any effort to know me or my life. sigh. I managed to speak up last time as the psychiatrist was 10mins late, then after he talked for a bit about the medication he was winding up , and I said I have some things I need to say, and told him how I felt about his comments. I felt like just a name on a list. he sort of apologised. any way I am concerned about the brain zap and and why i am experiencing it on increasing not coming off the medication thanks De",tassiedevil,Community Member,02-10-2019,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/brain-zaps/td-p/475588

PTSD-1192,First time post! Hoping last time search for help.,Hiya My name is not roo. I’m 27 yo female struggling with 17 years with my demons.I’m deeply ashamed of my mental illness and past sexual and mental abuse I received as a child. I’m here because I can’t even bring my self to leave my house. I’m currently unemployed and can’t afford the mental health support I’m in desperate need of. For the past 17 years I worked hard for my achievements and thrived in spite of situation. During that time I wouldn’t say I managing my illness but I endured my mental health. Even then it was unforgivable but knowing what I know now those are the good days. Unfortunately the past 2 years have I have crumbled and had to quit my job. I became so frantically unable to function that I had no choice. I now am nothing but a shell of what I once was and ever night I try and fight the darkness away. I know if don’t get the help I need but essential can’t afford I will lose this endless battle I feel live been fighting a life time. Please don’t judge or tell me it takes time. I’ve done time and it’s only worsening. I’ve searched and looked for every opinion and nothing is free nothing that can actually save me. This is my last resort. Possibly the last effort I have left in me to try pull myself out once more. I guess seeing other stories and other people who understand and know this struggle of being so disabled by their illness and having no means no options like me will give me the strength to do it on my own. Like everything in my life I’m in this own but maybe not alone.,Roo_w,Community Member,25-09-2019,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/first-time-post-hoping-last-time-search-for-help/td-p/470980

The only thing i do wrong is walk my dog in places dogs arent allowed. I opened the screen door and they moved right against me. One cop spent kept looking at my chest cause i had no bra on and it was obvious. They started accosting me where the teenagers are. I said what teenagers? They said i have teenagers living hear which i do not. In the end they realise they knocked on the wrong door.

I have regular visits with my psychiatrist who i have been seeing for over 7 years. I have also attended many groups sessions and one on one counselling, but sometimes its still not enough to remedy how i feel.

PTSD-1197,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is the beginning,"Hi, dears, I am a chronic patient, already over 10 years, I did not get rid of the voices. That was started after the PTSD injured caused by robbery happened at my 20th birthday. I have a good heart as people always told me. I am a good girl characteristic. Good in the musical instruments and art design during student, actively engaged in the school music festivals and won arts competition. I am a girl leader in schools. However, the Auditory hallucination with negative and depressive voices began after I finished my schools. I try to actively engage in the society but I felt discrimination and the auditory hallucination voices threatening me to be an active person. With the medication, the voices reduced to be the thought only when I am alone. Not voices anymore. Can anyone share their experiences with me for how to totally get rid of the voices disturbance? The reality is negative, a real-world is with sexuality and unrespectful, people wanted money, sex and power...... I cannot see real love. The voices made my health weak, very unhealthy. Finally, I went to Church last year. I wanted to get rid of the voices. I wanted to be successful. I wanted to be a good person. I wanted to engage in society positively. I wanted to be a healthy person. I wanted to help myself in order to help others.

That night i finalised that i am no more working there and today my boss called me for my whereabout. I explained i am quitting the job as i was been sexually abused by the man, and the owner was frowned at me when i used the word "" Sexually Abuse"" and he started to say that should not use that term and reminded me that it requires money to file a case. He even told me that people do this things for money and said there was an actor called Goffrey, where the alleged victim was accused back later. I am so disheartened to hear all this as i was looking for his support and he turn out to question me for my character and my money status.

Alcoholic father, verbally abusive, gas lighter. Looked after my mother with MH from the age of 11 and my younger brother, mother remains dependent. Raped age 13 and abused by an older man. Suffered repeated violence from my first boyfriend. His violence caused the loss of our baby. I was aged 15. Married and settled 34 years had two kids cancer in 2008 survived. I have a good job and responsibilities but no one knows what goes on in my head. My father made me feel worthless all my life this year he died of liver failure. I said good bye 3 days before as he asked to talk to me he still didn't say he loved me, he never did. I think about ending the pain sometimes, sometimes I punch myself for being stupid and the rest of the time I am just lonely and sad. I have anxiety and occasionally panic attacks they used to be a lot worse. The anxiety presents as swallowing difficulty when eating. I also have anger spikes which turn into hating myself. I'm posting to ask how you leave the past behind? I've seen a therapist through the GP but it was worth what I paid not much.

PTSD-1202,Dealing with triggers,"So I was diagnosed as having trauma after prolonged bullying/emotional abuse. I'm no longer in that situation and am getting professional help. The thing is that I am surrounded by triggers - people will simply say or do something that reminds me of what happened, send me into anxiety/tears. I even work with a very nice guy who is a huge trigger for me simply because of how he interacts with me. And of course sometimes flashbacks happen on their own. Maybe this is too personal a topic for people to respond to. People don't realise they trigger me - I have a very intuitive friend who has sort of clued in but sometimes she triggers me too. It's not their fault, they don't intend it. Every day something is bound to remind me of what happened and I hate it. Criticism, even constructive, is the worst. I can take criticism on its own, and before didn't worry so much about being criticised or corrected, but it is a massive trigger now, even if it's not a personal attack.

PTSD-1203,Stripped of a life dream.,"Hi, I write this post to hopefully see others experiences in this area. I was put into a situation where my employer/contractor was questioning my life and why I tried to commit suicide. As I truly believe in truth, I felt I have nothing to hide but the conversation became very heated, where this person believed that I did not try and commit suicide cause I did not succeed as she believes anything you do in life you succeed, and if I was real about it that I should go and do it, I became very angry fist punching the table and in absolute tears. It was a work Christmas party so alcohol was in play. The conversation came to a quick halt and by this time it was 4am in the morning and we had just stopped drinking. I no longer felt safe nor comfortable, so for the first time in my life I got in a car and drove for an 1 hour knowing I was over limit but I felt I was no longer safe and needed be somewhere that I would be. This all happen in December last year, by the time January rocked around I knew things were not all good. I shared a catering business with a person whom I thought was a friend. Late January got a phone call from my business partner stating she could no longer cope with what was happening which stemmed from Decembers event and that she wanted the business ceased as she wanted to save a friendship as well leave the woman whom we were contracted by as she could no longer cope with her controlling ways.. All her reasonings sounded factual and no reason for it not to be, so I agreed. Within 24 hours of this event, I lost my business, a friendship of over 15 years, and my lifes dream which took so long to a achieve. All my catering jobs gone, all business assets gone, to find out my ex-business partner had started a new catering business and continued working with the woman she so despised. Still to this day she works for this woman, all friendships I had created over my 2 years with this company were gone. People were told to have no contact with me. Today I struggle over the loss of friendships, and my passion for food. Some days are ok, but most is like mourning a loss so great as it was not easy to allow people into my life as dealing with BPD, PTSD, and depression is no baggage anyone wants to know about it.

PTSD-1205,Can't cope anymore after 2 decades of struggling,"First time using a forum, seeing if this may help. I was physically and emotionally abused by my parents from the age of 8, now 28. My dad was worse, he would chase me around the house and corner me. My mum slapped at me at times, never did anything to stop my dad. I was always a bubbly kid, sensitive but popular, loved people and my (extended) family. From about the age of 12 I started to develop depression, withdrew from my friends. By about the age of 14 I had MDD, severe generalised anxiety, bulimia and suicidal thoughts. My dad would always scream at me when I cried, or showed ""negative"" emotion so I held everything in and started drinking excessively to deal with them to the point where I abused it. At about 21 I'd finally had enough, I moved into my aunt's place. At this point my dad started spreading lies about me to my extended family. I don't know what he said but it was enough to make my nan (his mum) who was my only positive relationship turn nasty on me. I was devastated. That side of the family never knew what he was like, he was an ""angel"" to them and at home he turned on me. Never my sisters. Moved interstate not long after, still with MDD and anxiety. Since I've had a number of jobs where I've been bullied, struggled to build relationships or friendships because I'm so damaged and scared of people. I've on/off been struggling with bulimia and anxiety won't go away. I've tried a few psychologists but none have helped. I haven't spoken to my dad since I left, my mum I've recently cut off from her complete insensitivity and inability to be a mother. My dad and her are separated, only because he left, which I hold against her. I desperately want to move on and have a good life but everything I've tried has failed and now because of my negative experiences I'm too scared to leave the house. I know in my head these feelings aren't logical and I punish myself for acting this way. I don't have anyone to support me, family or friends, my sisters and i aren't close and my family has been turned against me. I just want to heal but it's so hard with no support. Most days i think about not wanting to be alive because i can't carry this anymore and I don't see the fog lifting after 2 decades. Just wanting to vent a bit but also if anyone has had a similar experience or advice would be welcome.

PTSD-1206,Depression - Anxiety - Seeking help,"I have had depression for as long as I can remember.. well, more precisely since school holidays transitioning from year 6 to 7 (high school). My sisters long-term boyfriend who was staying at our house came into my room late at night and tried to touch me inappropriately. I told him to back off and nothing came of it. I did tell my family (I’m the youngest of 5) and shit hit the fan. My sister went to live with him after finding out - I guess she was very much in love, didn’t want to believe it was true, and didn’t want to live with my annoying ass family. Realistically, she was in her own depressed slumber and couldn’t get out. A few years later she did realise that he was a bad person. She came home to live with my family again - at the time I was a teenager and was certain I’d never forgive her. But I did about 6 months later cos at the end of the day, she was the cooler of two sisters! My eldest sister was a mega bitch, selfish and jealous. Nonetheless.. my sister took a downward spiral in continuing to make poor choices in men. She ended up with a prescription drug addiction from which was mostly a somatic disorder - believing she had heart issues she didn’t have. A bad doctor prescribed her medicine continually even though she shouldn’t have got it. She abused her body for over 7 years of prescription medication and ended up passing away from an overdose. She left behind her 10 year old daughter. We all saw her going downhill and she refused help. That was just over a year ago since she died. Prior to that one of my brothers tried committing suicide (a few times) and was admitted to hospital after a public arrest from attempted suicide. He’s now pretending his life is awesome. I have had crippling anxiety especially towards work for 6 years. I always prepare myself for the worst and go over scenarios with people before and after social encounters. I put my resignation in at work yesterday. My boss is giving me the cold shoulder. It’s making things way worse for my anxiety. At work they think it’s the ‘pinnacle’ of the industry in which I work, its difficult to get into, and frankly you can take it as easy as you want. I’m slightly more ambitious and hard working aside from my regular depression which I do my best to hide.

PTSD-1209,I think I suffer from PTSD and am afraid of noises?,"Ok, here's the thing - I am very sensitive to noise, and can not tolerate loud noises at all. I don't like revving motorcycles/ traffic in general (really, who does?) and screaming children. It puts me in a state of fear where my heart races, I shake uncontrollably and I tend to retreat. In my childhood and teenagehood, I was exposed to a lot of loud noise whether I wanted it or not. Yelling teachers, screaming and out of control kids, etc. Now as an adult, I still hear loud noises I can not tolerate, like traffic. But recently I've thinking about it a lot and getting worried, and now everyday noises like making food gets me frightened and upset. For instance, today I accidently dropped a fork on a table while preparing lunch. While it wasn't excessively and unpleasantly loud, it startled me and I jumped, thinking the noise was going to escalate to something louder and Satan-like. I also have a sister who is autistic. She is prone to meltdowns every second day, and gets very loud in a frightening, heart jolting way. She also watches horror games that involves a lot of noise, and I think she picks up certain behaviours from them, even though she is an adult that shouldn't be so impressible. As a result, I think I may suffer from PTSD as a result of exposure to intentional loud noise directed at me. Now I'm getting fearful of everyday noises, and am so timid that I move awkwardly to avoid making even the most subtle of noise.",ScarlettR,Community Member,16-09-2019,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-think-i-suffer-from-ptsd-and-am-afraid-of-noises/td-p/458471
PTSD-1210,Psychiatrist versus Psychologist,"I have been seeing my psychiatrist for over 6 years. He is my rock. He knows how I feel, think and breathe. He is the third psychiatrist i have seen throughout my life. The first one was when I was 14 and the second when i was approximately 20. I am now 58. In between i have seen a myriad of psychologists and counselors and unfortunately they never recognised me as having CPTSD. So i spent 38 years searching for answers but I never gave up. During the 38 years i developed an addiction to alcohol which brought my life and the lives of my family nothing but mayhem and sadness. I have always been honest about my drinking and as such I would discuss this with the counselors and psychologists. Despite my disclosure of a myriad of other behaviors and things (including severe depression) occurring in my life, they always determined alcohol as the cause for all of my problems. If I were to give up alcohol then all would be good! I'm not suggesting that any substance abuse is good, what I am saying is that it is not the cause. Because of my personal experience I wonder if psychologists are able to identify the cause of substance abuse and or the symptoms of complex disorders such as CPTSD, which I have.

PTSD-1211,Is it ok to ask my grown son to give me a safe place to stay for a while away from his father?,"I’ve been married for more than 40 years. Our relationship is now toxic and I need to get out. My husband had pushed and persuaded me to move interstate and now I’m isolated from my family and friends. Up until then I was happy. I loved where I was living, my home was my sanctuary. I do like where I am now but can no longer live with my husband. My husband abuses me in the most strange way and that’s by getting me off guard and when I believe all is going really smoothly he’ll do the most hurtful things. But most distressingly, he’ll hurt me by not allowing me to heal or recover when I’m sick and where possible he’ll find a way to physically hurt me or cause pain. Eg. I was suffering from cluster headaches. OUCH! Also known as (suicide headaches) They’d start at 3am and he’d hold me as I struggle and cried. I became noise sensitive, loud sounds triggered an attack. Husband would use his industrial wipper snipper for hours and then his industrial leaf blower, when I finally caught his attention to stop he flew into a rage and told me his entitled to use his equipment as he wishes. He’d turn all the taps off incredible tight when my hands had flared up with arthritis . After diagnosed with fibromyalgia he’d convince me massage would help, these massages became so painful I’d scream and cry for him to stop, but he’d just laugh at me while drinking wine as he’s hurting me. I’d feel sick for hours after and was bruised so deeply that after showing a friend they were shocked and simply said, ‘that’s really dangerous’. When I’d asked him about this just recently he said: there must be something wrong with your body because I wasn’t pressing hard. And there’s many more similar incidents over the years. My family and friends simply don’t understand how bad my situation can be, to all he is or can be kind and charming. He also engages in other forms of ‘gaslighting’ leaving me so confused and bewildered I can hardly function. I have nowhere to go and I’m desperate to leave this madness. I’d like to know if it’s ok to ask my son to allow me to stay with him for a while as he lives alone? I don’t like the idea of painting a bad picture of his father to him and this is not my intention. I feel I need a safe place to think and heal.

PTSD-1213,vulnerable and at a loss as what to do,hi Oh my how many times have i started to write a post and then deleted it.I have searched and searched and searched but as i am not an emergency or suicidal they try but can only give me 5.And i know what its like to be suicidal and be put on hold.So if your reading this i actually got the courage to press enter.I dont know if anyone can help but i think i just need to talk . I have sat here most of the night frozen to my chair not knowing what to do and thinking that no its not right.Yesterday there was an incident at my house where people jumped my side fence and entered my adult daughters bedroom .i woke up with her screaming race out there and she was being held against the side of the house.Things got a bit messy .i rang the police and after they had our puppies in the car got told that it is not trespass if somebody jumps your fence enters your house and if they state that it is theirs its ok and then when my daughter said she would do the same then they laughed at her.I feel unsafe in my own house i can not find anyone that will give me an ear to vent i just am a mess i have rang the free legal advice and i still am unable to clarify if what the police said is true .So saying i am traumatised is an understatement If the police wont protect you who will,chitchat,Community Member,10-09-2019,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/vulnerable-and-at-a-loss-as-what-to-do/td-p/449593
PTSD-1214,How to determine if past events did happen?,"Hello, how is everyone? Hope you all are well. Currently, I am remembering some events from the past, however, I cannot confirm if it did or did not happen. Unfortunately, I have nobody I could verify with. Is there some form of effective therapy to determine if something did happen the way it happened? This is just my individual personal experience, and the things I remembered could perhaps have happened. Also, my apologies but I can't disclose what this is about but it is definitely a matter of did it or didn't it happen. Thank you so much and I hope you all have a nice day.",whenwewereyoung,Community Member,05-09-2019,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-to-determine-if-past-events-did-happen/td-p/444405
PTSD-1215,C-PTSD / PTSD Establishment of a long term relationship with father who molested me for a decade.,"I’m interested in hearing anyone’s story of establishing a long term relationship with the person who sexually abused you. A renewed relationship with my own , Father, lasted for a protracted period of time (years). I made a well-intended yet inevitably doomed relationship with my sexual abuser. His impending death from cancer, heart issues & MND caused me a great deal of cognitive dissonance. I felt really sad for my father - the child molester. That happened earlier this year. Fast forward to now the relationship is terminated. My C-PTSD has emerged again after 27 years. The flashbacks, anxiety, OCD & depression have marred my year. The memories of the purely evil sexual abuse inflicted on me from the ages of 2 - 12 by my father have been devastating and crazy-making. I'll be very interested to hear from other victims of childhood sexual abuse who have established a relationship with their abuser.

PTSD-1216,The long road to recovery,"After 30 years I found myself in the invidious position of having no choice but to admit to my wife that I was sexually abused as a child and I have to say that everything I dreaded about that moment in regards to her reaction turned out to be completely false and nothing more than my own unrealistic and irrational fears as she was amazingly understanding and supportive. My wife is a psychologist and inadvertently forced my hand in the issue as she became convinced that I was no longer attracted to her due to the fact that she had gained a some weight when in fact it was my aversion towards intimacy that was the cause of this and even though I had never spoken to anyone about this, at least no one who believed me, I knew that I could not lose the love of my life over this and began a very difficult conversation with her that was highly emotional but also very liberating for us both. There is no profit in going into the details of the abuse itself but I will say that it was of the most severe kind and carried out over the course of several years, though intermittently as I was fortunate enough to not live in the same house as my abuser. At the time that it occurred I attempted to tell a teacher at school and also the librarian both of whom I believed would help me and the reason I believed this is because I had been removed from my home on several occasions due to unrelated physical abuse from a violent step father, however, their reaction to this information was to ignore it altogether which as a young child left me with the belief that this was something I was not supposed to be talking about and so I never spoke about it again. By the time I was old enough to realise that this was not the case I had pushed the experience so far down into the deepest recesses of my memory that I did not wish to dredge it up and as I had moved far away from my abuser and he was no longer a threat I felt it best to say nothing thinking that I could pretend that it never happened. Another reason that I remained silent was that I had often heard the theory that the abused go on to become abusers and I was scared that if I admitted what had happened that I would be seen as a potential predator myself and this further added weight to my decision to remain quiet. There is more to my story and the long shadow that abuse has cast over my adult life but I do not have the room for it in this post but I will continue to post in the hope that my story may help others.",the_real_you,Community Member,27-08-2019,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/the-long-road-to-recovery/td-p/435091

PTSD-1218,Newby - Needing some faith in therapy,"Hi all, I'm struggling with resurgence from a physically violent relationship from 4 years ago. I never followed through on therapy as I've had little success with it. One lady clearly lost faith in me when she said I should leave my partner and from then on she became detached and almost cynical. She also started nodding off in front of me! That was my last session with her! I've dealt with it my humanising my ex abuser, I see him a child in need of help, like a 4 year old throwing a tantrum because he doesn't know how to process his emotions. Which I believe is exactly what was happening to him when he would snap. Part of his brain/heart never grew up. So I feel sorry for him. I rarely feel sorry for myself about it, in fact I've managed to gain strength and power through seeing myself as a survivor. But I've never properly processed what actually happened, and I've never systematically told anyone the real truth. I told the police nothing at the time after my boss called the cops, I protected by abuser. Now I have fits of crying that can be brought on by a small thing, stubbing my toe, biting my lip while eating, pain is now an emotional trigger where I feel utterly helpless and alone while also being incredibly angry. I know I haven't processed this properly. I'd love to hear any positive stories regrading talk therapy and also open to alternative therapies and healing.

PTSD-1219,Hi i'm new here and wanted to rant,"Hi I have suffered life-long depression and anxiety and I wanted to find a place were I could connect with people that are going through the same thing. Every day is unbearable levels of anxiety and paranoia, afraid to leave the house, not trusting anyone around me, never letting anyone be behind me, being extremely on edge if I see a car outside my house, I don't have a normal social network, no friends or family and the only person in my life that I communicate with is my counsellor. I told him I didn't want to see him anymore in a moment of panic but he consoled me and I'm glad he did. When I was a child I suffered an injury that is fatal in majority of cases and yet I was in the minority that survived why me? why was I the one to survive? I'm angry that I survived that and have to suffer the pain of death again, and I pray every night that I don't wake up in the morning and when I do wake up its just another day of this torment. I sometimes go to university but being in public for long periods of time is guaranteed panic attacks which have only become more intense as I've gotten older, but going to university is one of the only reasons I leave the house. go to the counsellor, buy food/clothes or go to university there is no other reason for me to leave and suffer panic.",gsd8,Community Member,04-09-2019,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/hi-i-m-new-here-and-wanted-to-rant/td-p/443246
PTSD-1220,Post traumatic symptoms without PTSD?,"I feel a bit hesitant posting here, because I am fairly certain from what I have read of the symptoms (I have not seen a psychiatrist about this) that I do not meet the criteria for PTSD, but I do get flashbacks, which seems to be quite a bit worse than ""regular"" anxiety, and I wondered if anybody on this forum felt/wondered the same. I have some years of experience with social and other anxiety, and, again, I do not want to imply that what I am going through or have gone through is equivalent to some of the stories I read on this forum, but I keep feeling like the coping strategies that I have developed are probably inadequate. I have already described this elsewhere on these forums so I don't want to go into it too much (and also the hour is very late), but I had a bad trip from cannabis about four years ago, and it only lasted about two hours, but they included a sense/delusion that the intense and constantly mounting dread was all I had ever felt and all I would ever feel. I am not sure that really explains it, but I suppose ""bad trip"" would probably give a general idea. I guess it's not really the point. There was a seizure, screaming, some semi-wild behaviour that I saw myself engaging in rather than choosing to, and mostly about four times of coming back to normal and then coming back to eternal hell. I don't know what to do about triggers. They're weird. Things like deja vu, gibberishy-reminescent things, voices coming through speakers or phones, becoming focused on the rhythm of conversation or movement instead of the content... as I write this I feel it is not likely many will identify. I also do not know if many will identify with the sense that trying to avoid a flashback immediately and intensely worsens things. Or with the fear that I still have even without flashbacks happening, that I will become psychotic. I guess this stuff is good to say even if it is barking up the wrong tree. I have actually never spoken or even read of someone with a similar experience and am not quite sure where to look.",Fielder,Community Member,01-08-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/post-traumatic-symptoms-without-ptsd/td-p/492010
PTSD-1221,Perceptions of healthy father daughter relationships,"I was sexually abused by my father until I was 7, and then exposed to sexual behaviours, comments and actions until much later. I am 22 now and have had no contact with him for about 6 months after I confessed to my uncle about the abuse due to my concern about my father around children. He threw doubt in to my mind, and scorned me for telling my uncle and basically that I was sick to think he ever did those things despite a previous confession by him which he also explained away.. I now have a partner of 2 years and he is awesome. However he has two little girls 4 and 7 and I cannot get my internal chatter to stop and despite continued therapy, my mind try's to convince me every time they interact that this man is a predator. He has not shown me anything that would give me precedent to believe that, however in the last two years I have taken over baths and dressing of the girls because seeing him doing those things makes me fly into a panic attack. I know why. And I know it is my problem not his, I do NOT want to make him feel like a predator but it seriously feels like its ripping me apart when I see them in certain situations. I feel like I am taking away part of their normal father daughter dynamic by not allowing him to do these things. He is very supportive and he understands that deep down I know he is a protector, that they are safe with him - I just want to shake the fear that comes whenever they are with us. If anyone has had a similar experience and has advice on how to overcome this please tell me, I love them all with everything I have and I want to move forward from this..",Imokbutstillstruggling,Community Member,04-09-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/perceptions-of-healthy-father-daughter-relationships/td-p/443549

PTSD-1223,Dad's attempted suicide and uni's refusal to approve special consideration,"Hi all, I'm incredibly hurt, frustrated, angry and upset to put it in a nutshell, and as I am currently fuelled by anger, this may come across very blunt. Six weeks ago my dad attempted to kill himself and it affected our whole family greatly, I was so shocked as I didn't realise my dad felt that way and felt so lost that I hadn't noticed it before. As of today, he came out of the mental health ward feeling much better and has moved to a transitional house for 2 weeks before he's allowed to come home. It's been one of the most challenging times for my dad, and our family combined but I am so so grateful that he is still with us today. During this time, however, I had to undertake an exam for uni that I knew I could not miss as it was a must-pass type of exam. Unfortunately, I ended up failing it by 2%, and I put that down to being both incredibly ill and the events that happened with my dad. I applied for special consideration within my uni as I literally only failed by 2 marks!! However, I received the results today and it has been declined as it's an 'insufficient case'.? How can a close family member's attempted suicide (and almost death) not be grounds for special consideration in terms of your grades/ assessment/ exam results?? At first, when I read the email I was in absolute tears as I'm so confused how that wouldn't count. Now, I'm furious as to how this can be assessment policy?? - This is what the email mentioned when I was told it was declined. I am curious if anyone else has had a similar experience at all? Or, knows someone that has and what or if they have done anything about it. I'm considering taking this further and actually appealing their decision. Then looking into the assessment policies in universities around Australia, and how they are equipped to address this kind of a situation. So far, I have found nothing. So, how can they reject this on the grounds that it 'doesn't fit in assessment policy' when it's not included in the first place? So, has anyone else experienced this? And, if so, what do you recommend I do?

PTSD-1224,CPTSD and keeping busy,"Hi everyone, I posted before explaining that I'd been diagnosed with Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Depression. I have been taking medications for several months and they seem to be working okay, but I was supposed to be starting EMDR soon, but on my last visit to my psychiatrist he didn't think I was quite ready. So I feel like a bit of failure. He tells me it can be very traumatic and due to the nature of my trauma there are never any guarantees it will work. So I then felt a bit hopeless The other thing we've been talking about in sessions is my tendency to try to keep busy. I wondered if anyone else found this? So he thinks that an avoidance strategy for me is to be constantly doing things, working full time, studying, anything. Before I started to see him, I began a PhD...I know!! that was alongside working full time and it's only recently that I've realised how negatively it affects my health. So, one of the things I have to work is not feeling like I have to be doing things all the time. Maybe I'm trying to feel less useless, I don't know. I'm just so tired, and want to feel alive again, if I ever did.

PTSD-1225,Emotional Support Kitten - Help me Please,"Hello Lovelies, Obligatory first time poster no idea what I'm doing but I hope your thoughts are peaceful. For the past ten or so years I have struggled with severe Anxiety and Depression. We are still in the middle of finding a diagnosis for what is wrong. I have tried a lot of things; everything that I could think of and now I would like to ask for some help. I recently learnt about Emotional Support Animals and I was wondering if anyone here has one; preferably a cat, as I am terrified of dogs, and how that is going. I have reached out to a few local trainers and they stress that due to already having cats this may not be viable. However both my Psychologist and GP seem interested in following this path. Has this worked for anyone? I just can't help but think that having another being, a comfort with me would allow me to do things that I am currently limited from doing, but at the same time I don't want to stress out my two already indoor cats. ESAnimals don't have the same privileges as Guide dogs but there is a legal form/letter and everything. I would really like to hear anyone's opinions or personal stories regarding an animal helping with Anxiety in the outside world. This is something I desperately want to try but I don't want to ruin one's lives. Whether it be my roommates or my pets. Thanks for taking the time to read this I look forward to any input.

PTSD-1226,A day that changed everything.,"The morning started out like any other. I set an early alarm to begin on another day's journey on my Euro Trip. The day was November 12, 2018. After panicking momentarily to find the station in Marseille, I found my coach 10 minutes before departure time. So far so good as I got comfy in my seat for a 3 hour journey. After 3 hours our Coach stopped over in Montpelier for a 40 minute pit stop. Perfect oñportunity to grab a quick bite to eat and stretch the legs. After trying to find a place open open before 11am I made my way to the McDonalds and grabbed a Breakfast Muffin and a Coffee. Looking at the time I inhaled my meal and made way for the station. Whilst relying heavily on Google Maps I got lost in the process and panic began to set in. After almost 20 minutes of frantic searching I finally found the stop where my bus would very soon be departing from. After running to the stop, I asked the driver if this was the bus heading to Barcelona, to which he replied yes. After looking less than impressed at my question, he told me to load my luggage on the other side of the coach, the side facing traffic. Without giving it much thought I made my way around the front of the coach only to be stopped in my tracks by a van driving past at 60-70km/hr. Had I stepped out 2-3 seconds earlier, I would have most likely been killed. Shaken up and angry at the bus driver ar the same time, I loaded my belongings in to the coach and tried to shake the incident off. Well that was 9 months ago, and my PTSD hasn't subsided since that day. I still get flashbacks of that day, Imagine how my family and friends would have reacted to the news of my death and I play this moment on repeat every single day. Life hasn't been easy since then. I constantly feel detached from my surroundings and daily tasks have become mammoth.

PTSD-1228,Abandonment x 3,"Hi all, Just sharing my experience with childhood abandonment - my past trauma is still incredibly present in my every day life. As I’ve been told by psychotherapists, it’s no wonder my issues are present, because I have had 20 odd years of telling myself that I’m not good enough. my Dad left my family when I was four. It took us years to realise he left to another country. No letters, no phone calls. Soon after that, my mum started a new family, devoting herself to three more children. During all of this, I became incredibly codependent on my older brother. He was truly my rock. Who eventually left me in search of my dad. i felt like, in three different ways, the people I loved the most sort out to leave or avoid loving me. To this day, I’m still fighting for quality time with my mum, trying to keep these relationships together. I now speak to my dad as well. Which is hard because you kind of have all of these expectations of how it should be, and it’s nothing like you expect. It’s distant mateship really. im just all sorts of ready to not feel fear in my present life. I’m also ready to feel like myself and my needs are worth catering to.

PTSD-1231,Overwhelmed,"I am not one to seek help, preferring to work through my own issues, but lately things have been a little overwhelming and those I work with suggested I speak to someone. I thought this might be a start at expressing how I feel. I'll begin with a little background information. I do not have a diagnosed mental disorder, although those who know me well will say that I am a tad OCD. By and large I have always been a happy person. I have a rather full plate when it comes to family and work dealing with everything from behaviour disorders to cancer, but so far I have been able to juggle my complex life and relationships. I work full-time, very long hours, and most week-ends. Suffice to say I am often tired! I retrained late in life to enter the field of education and it pretty much dictates my life - work and home, home and work. At work I am well respected and most importantly I enjoy what I do. In fact I was having a really good year until a new student was added to the mix. Without going into detail, this student engages in violent behaviour. In my profession it is not uncommon to be physically and verbally abused. Over the years I have grown a very thick skin, however, this situation has caused me more than a little angst. I have felt fear for myself and others. I have felt frustrated, sad, worried, and helpless. I know that I have done everything humanly possible to maintain control but I still feel a sense of inadequacy. I cry without reason, and am finding it hard to concentrate. The other day somebody touched my should in passing and I burst into tears. I kept apologising for crying and started to shake uncontrollably. It was very embarrassing. I hated how it made me feel. I'm always the shoulder, never the tears. I understand what I have experienced is bound to have an impact. I'm not that naive, but the gravity I think is what has rocked me to my core. Although the student has been removed, I still feel emotionally and physically drained.

PTSD-1234,PSTD and Pornography addiction,"Hello. I would appreciate hearing from any one who has been going through what I am going through. I have been trying to cope with my husband's internet pornography and sex addition for well over 10 years, have never told any friends or family for fear of embarrassing him and myself!!! We are old, in our 70s, physically healthy, have been married for 53 years... he is a Vietnam veteran diagnosed with PTSD. He denies it is a problem. His addiction has caused me so much grief and sadness, I was totally heart broken and felt total worthlessness, but am okay now, in fact in many ways I am stronger but sad. I have lost all respect, trust and faith in him. I did have a little counselling and have asked him get help but he won't, says he is fine and it's none of my business. I am just so sad that this is the how life is now for us. Otherwise he is a decent man.",Sadshame,Community Member,02-08-2019,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/pstd-and-pornography-addiction/td-p/493250

Deep down inside everyday, I struggle to be positive and happy and not ""feel sorry"" for myself but the truth is I am lonely and empty. I grow up with my grandparents who are now passed on I have no other family all I have is myself. Which I struggle with because I am very family-oriented and I literally have no one to call or see and crave someone to love me and make me feel important. I could disappear today and no one would notice I'm gone and that's scary. I have gone through so many situations alone, being homeless, got out a domestic violence relationship where I was stabbed, the loss of my friends due to isolation from my past relationship, the loss of my family. I've been bankruptcy from a business I started and I am only 26. I struggle to just push on and be happy and not let anything get to me. I just lonely and sad and crave to be wanted and to be well.

PTSD-1237,Depressed wannabe Psychologist,"I am a 25 year old guy who has just finished his psychology degree. A little older than the rest of my class, I took 5.5years to get through the 3 year course due to a whole host of issues. Still have 4th year and masters/PhD to go (complex pathways, but essentially minimum 3 years left) At first I didnt really wanna be there, i wanted to be a rockstar (lol.) Then the drummer in my band got murdered in 2015, and since then things have just got worse and worse. I was an 'emo kid' in early highschool, and got bullied up until the final two years when i carved out a new identity as a guy who smoked at school and played music. I never really felt comfortable in that identity though. Im certainly not a 'bad boy' type. I also did really well in school until that point when i stopped giving a shit. I feel as i write this that i am making a lot of excuses for myself. About a year ago I started therapy, and it has helped a lot. My therapist is toying with diagnoses of dysthymia/PDD and believes that i may have been in 'double depression' in 2017/2018 before i saw him, but we focus on talk therapy rather than meds. I have a lot of issues coming from a family that had violence perpetrated by my father (who i never managed to resent for it) against my mother and sister, and my sister who has mild borderline personality disorder as a result (and yet i do resent her, go figure. She use to threaten to kill me, and would attempt physical harm on me and others. I tend to subjugate myself, accommodate everyone else's needs and struggle to assert myself. I become avoidant, and at worse i surrender. When i surrender i can get really agitated and have suicidal thoughts. They're almost impulses, and they scare me. This pattern has also kept me in a 3-year long-distance relationship with a very emotionally manipulative woman who puts herself in hospital with 'burnout' or 'anxiety' when i try to pull away. I have lost almost all of my peer support network save for two friends I see about once a month so as not to burden them with my issues.",Dephog,Community Member,07-08-2019,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/depressed-wannabe-psychologist/td-p/500427

I thought I should hate them but because of the way I have ended being treated by the public (like a lying, manipulating idiot) I am starting to feel like I should legitimately forgive them and forget. Anyone else agree that this is very smart? Should I or should I not forgive the people? I nearly lost my life because of my ex-partner on many occasions. But I am just really sick of feeling like the crazy one who is a liar. What his family did was really awful. Maybe the best way for me to do that is just never mention it again?

PTSD-1240,Guilt & unsure,"I am extremely unsure about a traumatic event that happened to me 2 years ago. I was travelling in Europe (had a boyfriend at the time) and when I was in Italy I got extremely drunk on a night out. I was with some friends and throughout the night a man was hanging out with our group - no one really said anything about him hanging around us because we were all pretty drunk. Later on, we were on our way home and he offered to take one of us on his quad bike up the hill to drop me home. I asked to be taken because I was too tired and drunk to walk up the hill. In this time, apparently I was kissing his neck (I messaged him in the morning asking details of what had happened) and from what I remember, he pulled over on a beach somewhere and we had sex. I don’t really remember this happening, I am not sure if I consented to this. I remember crying straight after it happened, saying I have a boyfriend. I also remember being in pain but again not saying anything. I told my boyfriend about it, and later got tested and got an STI. What if he was extremely drunk as well? Is it still taking advantage? I told my boyfriend I was taken advantage of, but 2 years later I am second guessing myself and living with crippling guilt every single day. What if I am just a cheater trying to justify my poor actions? What if I am just a liar ? I constantly think I am a terrible person and my boyfriend is incredible for wanting to stay with me. Everyone always talks to me asking about how my Europe holiday was and all I can think of is this traumatic event. I have to constantly hide this event and it is so difficult. I feel like if everyone knew the terrible things I have done they would be disgusted. I feel like my mental health has never been the same and this event occurred 2 years ago and I am still obsessing over it. Any advice to get over the guilt and move on with my life ? I constantly think the only way to move forward is to break up with my boyfriend so I don’t feel the guilt, but I love him so much. I feel extremely stuck and as though this event will haunt me forever.

She says I’ve spent my life avoiding my trauma. I’ve been putting it away. And now as a result of this recent trigger I am feeling IT ALL. I don’t know how to cope with this much emotion. I am being reckless and impulsive. I’m spending all my money, I’m driving my car like a maniac, I’m chatting to random men in dating apps.

PTSD-1242,"How to know if something I vaguely ""remember"" really happened?","Hi, Disclaimer: I'm not pretending to be suffering from PTSD or trauma, nor am I implying that anyone else but me might have ""fabricated"" memories. I'm posting this here because I know in some cases traumatic memories can be ""buried"" so I suppose there are techniques to recover them or ways to deal with ""not knowing"" that could be shared in this space. I trust the admins to move the post if it isn't in the right place and apologise if anyone feels offended by this. This is difficult and I'm only writing about it because this forum is anonymous. I have disturbing ""memories"" that I am questioning. Something might have happened between my half-brother and me when I was (I think) around 8 - he would have been around 13 then. I'm questioning it because my brother is a good person and because I have always had a very active imagination, vivid dreams and unfortunately I did lie often as a kid (nothing bad though, I can't remember ever making up a story to get someone in trouble). There's also the fact that I can remember thinking about sexual things from a pretty early age, so it's not impossible that I would have ""invented"" the events. I generally have a pretty poor memory - I don't remember a lot from my early years and I am known to forget entire conversions, or remember them incorrectly. I know it isn't unusual for childhood memories to get embellished/amplified/distorted etc. and that ""fake memories"" are a thing. On the other side, why would I make such things up? I've always admired my brother. We weren't very close until my later teen years because of the age difference. My parents did once say I was a bit in his shadow and that I sort of got out of my shell when he left for university. I've never felt this way though. The ""memories"" don't include any physical coercion and aren't horrific. I can only remember two instances. They are vague around the act in itself but also entail very specific details, just like other childhood memories that are true for sure. So how to know if this was real??? Do I even need to know given that I don't suffer from any major disorder, ""only"" from mild anxiety and low self-esteem? Wouldn't I be way more messed up if it was true? But what if this is just waiting to blow up in my face? And if it's not true, does it mean I'm a really disturbed pathological liar and don't even know it? I feel physically horrible writing these things. Can hypnosis help?

PTSD-1243,Living in domestic violence while suffered from anxiety and depression,"First I apologise for my English and I’m writing this from my phone. I am from South America and I’m with an australian guy. We’ve been quite a while together and sometimes we have really bad fights that triggers my anxiety and I think that triggers his anger, at first in the middle off the fight he used to hold me really tight amd chocked me (he does bjj) and put his hand on my mouth, he keep doing it harder and harder while my anxiety keep growing until one day i had to bite his finger because I couldn’t breathe and he hit me in the eye, leaving me with a black eye. last week he came semi drunk at 3am demanding things while i was trying to sleep, he started to fight and I got a panic attack and i went for water the next thing i know is that I’m in the floor being kick and chocked while I scream “let me go”. I am truly depressed and anxious and scared every time he treated me, I feel there’s anything I can do. I’m on partner visa and I can’t just simply leave. I’m scared to file for domestic violence and loose my visa because he decided not to be the person he was. I don’t know what to do I’m so tired.

Diagnosed ADHD, made bankrupt by default (solvent at time) former aggravated girlfriend insisted revenge, requests to see me seven days after she made me involuntary bankrupt. Set's me up, I am beaten by two men, 9 days in hospital and now PTSD and default bankrupt. Two weeks afterwards whilst in recovery at parents home mum refuses to access to my medicine, mum calls police, same police arrive as the ones from before, further denied rights charged and discriminated by police, left homeless, AVO and three charges, family eventually apologize for calling police. Asked to work for my father (""Move forward son, forget the past"") As I could not bare the thought of my former girlfriend obtaining dividends via my trustee/wage and knows the whereabouts and if I refrain from giving these details I could be arrested. I accept work on the conditions that my father save my income in a separate account. As a result, a year and 1 week later, I exercise my writ to my savings, father/employer dismisses me after an internal work issue (Unfairly dismissed) now father / employer denies my writ, I am left again helpless and homeless, this time a relative mediates a settlement with my family to start a new life in Italy. My personal belongings are shipped over on an agreed settlement that my funds a transferred to me whilst there, in hopes of marriage and a new beginning.

I regularly have flashbacks, anxiety attacks and go into a hyper-vigilant state on a daily basis, but i still dont believe what I have gone through justifies that label. i am really struggling with this in my head. I know what happened is, in the eyes of the law, worse than someone inappropriately touching me but i dont feel that it is as bad as other forms of sexual assault.

PTSD-1247,Supporting  a friend with PSTD,"I am been supporting a friend with PSTD for the last 8 months. Much of this have actually been happy times for us as friends and valued by both. At times my support and care was valued and at times clung too. Its always been a fine line between providing the support and giving space. The PSTD has been compounded by a housing issue for which there is no current resolution. He has received specialised counselling since last August but referrals to a psychiatrist have been slow and the first appointment is for next week. He was prescribed anti depressants in late October and they appeared to allow him to function and even have some happy times but he was unable to sleep. In a series of disappointments for him he went off his medication for a week and resulted in a change of medication, this time leaving him sleepy, irritable and totally fixed on his problem. He has been angry at me for this time and now believes the care and support I have offered do nothing to help him. Over the period he has pushed back on me 4 times, in person, in phone conversation and now in text which have caused me some distress but I also understand the person I valued has a mental health problem of significance. Each time he has wanted contact but reduced its scope. Face to face went to phone only, we reached a point in December/January were we did both. 3 weeks ago he told me the conversations that once gave him happiness now caused him pain and he didn't have the strength to talk. Last evening he pushed away from the texts. ""Kind words would not help is situation"". I am aware he has pushed others away and then been critical of them for a lack of support. He has always been remorseful after the the upsetting , angry times. I don't want to be the one who walks away and at the same time don't want this to cause me pain. I cut the conversation off last night with an ok, Have a good evening rather than cause any further damage to either. I have read many of the threads on what to say . They haven't worked.The kindness and care is simply rejected as being of no use although he is grateful.

PTSD-1251,Overwhelmed and unsure,"My name is Amy, I am 25 years old and am a university student. I have battled anxiety and depression since my childhood. I feel it's gotten worse after my late father became verbally/emotionally abusive towards me and I was betrayed by my older sister after she got married. She said vicious things about my mum and me to please her husband and in-laws, stole money from my mum, lied on multiple occasions and tried to turn us (me and mum) against each other. This betrayal affected me physically and emotionally for two to three years after I moved out with my mother. And it still does until now. I reunited with my sister in February 2019 as she experienced domestic violence by her husband since the beginning of their marriage. I have tried to take things slowly with her by spending time with her and her one year old son. Yet she is frequently dishonest, makes excuses to avoid acknowledging her mistakes and neglecting her responsibilities as a mother. Whenever me or my mum confront her about her behaviour, she ignores us and pretends that we never spoke about it or complains that we are ""upsetting her or trying to anger her"". There are days that I can't stand being with her in the same room and I have to say that ""I am busy"" or that ""I am okay"" to avoid any confrontations from her. I have tried to talk with my mum and closest friend about my feelings. Yet I feel that I have burdened them as I have been very overwhelmed and constantly complained to them about my anxiety and depression. I have told my mum on multiple occasions that I want to seek counselling to overcome my feelings yet she always tells me that ""they can't help you or resolve your issues"". She also tells me to not talk about it as she is already distressed about the situation and that so long as I pray that things will get better. I have frequently prayed everyday that my sister's behaviour would improve. But I'm beginning to lose hope that it will happen. I have given up on talking to my mum and friends about my feelings.

PTSD-1252,"Intense implicit flashback? don't know what to do, tried online counseling chat but no one was there","I am not in danger, I'm not suicidal and I'm not going to/hurting myself. I just need to get this out and talk to someone who will actually recognise how serious this is. I'm just having a really really really bad time and need to talk to someone but am nonverbal while it's going on, therefore can only talk online. Also can't video chat, i just can't deal with anything sensory right now. It's also why I have problems with grounding techniques. I'm not dissociating during flashbacks, and am extremely hyperaware/sensitive so being made to focus on more sensory information like smell/sound/breathing/another person is horrible. The current issue is that I've recently had some things brought to light, and though I have had positive outcomes from them immediately, I think it's caused this current body (implicit) flashback. The main cause I can identify is that there's possibly been a build up subconsciously as I have believed that I am dealing with everything quite well, while actually not pursuing adequate responses/acknowledgement (from professionals and support network) and therefore unaware of just how much is being silenced. recent events have further pushed me to consciously ignore the reality of how I'm feeling, but it's too much. I'm really worried at how bad I am feeling. It's like a huge spiral wasn't being acknowledged then went out of control. I'm feeling so horrible, shaking, nauseous and just so frantic but I don't know why except that the actual ordeal of the last few weeks has been minimised over and over- a running theme, my whole life- and i keep not saying or mentally accepting how bad I've been feeling. and I'm subconsciously feeling worse and worse until now it's just exploded. The last few weeks have been so bad, because I don't know how I'm supposed to process any of it and people are saying ""take it easy "" but have acted normally so i felt like I have had to do the same. Yet not a single person I've spoken to is behaving like they get how serious this has been. I can't figure out why that bothers me. It's not anyone's fault or responsibility or obligation to have anything to do with this and I don't understand my feelings about that. I dont want sympathy or coddling, I hate being told to slow down. But I think that is because the physical/visible side isn't the issue and I feel like everything that's happened is being completely ignored.

PTSD-1253,My alcoholic father,"I hope this is the right space to post this. For as long as I can remember, my dad has been an alcoholic. When he drinks, he becomes loud, he yells, he takes everything out on my mum, he says mean things, and he slams doors. This is ‘normal’ to me. It’s how things always have been. It’s really affecting my anxiety. My partner and I live away, but if I’m not with my parents I spend all my time worrying about how my dad is treating my mum. When I am at my parents home, I spend all my time anxious about when he’s next going to yell at my mum. I was anxious last night and had difficulty sleeping while with my partner. I woke up at 2am, and texted my mum at 3am asking if she was ok. Because my dad is in a mood again and has been yelling at my mum. I couldn’t get to sleep again for a couple of hours, because I had a bad feeling as to why she hadn’t replied the night before. When she responded at 9am this morning she told me my dad had argued/yelled at her from 10pm-3am when he went to bed. I spoke to someone a week ago on BeyondBlue chat, and also 1800Respect live chat. They both said it was domestic violence, which I hadn’t considered before. I know what he does isn’t right, but I hadn’t considered it to be abusive until now. But it is. Now that i have this information I’m not sure what to do to stop it. My mum told me my brother has been trying to stand up to him but then my dad told my mum he wanted my brother to die.

PTSD-1254,Affect on relationships after emotional and mental abuse,"Hi there, 2 years ago I was finally able to exit an emotionally/mentally abusive relationship that carried on for 7 years. Around the same time I was diagnosed with ADD. My female friends were supportive of me leaving my abuser however the entire social group carried on like nothing had ever happened. Despite attempting to articulate my feelings, my friends could not understand that his presence and continued association, no matter how small, was harmful to me, and took my absence personally. Long story short the friendships fractured and I lost my social circle. I am not sure how to explain the breakdown in relationships to other mutual friends. I neither wish to vilify my old friends or make myself look like a victim. Also bringing up the aspect of abuse seems to make people VERY uncomfortable and they shut down. I am lucky to have a great partner but without my friends I do feel very lonely at times, having lost my social circle. I feel very broken and misunderstood. No to mention the confusion trying to decipher which actions of mine are due to trauma behaviours or ADD symptoms. The lack of support and losing my friendship circle post abuse has honestly been just as painful, perhaps even worse than the abuse itself and there seems to be very little literature about how to cope with this scenario. It seems to assume that your friends will choose you over the abuser and rally to your support.",EverlastingDaisy,Community Member,07-07-2019,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/affect-on-relationships-after-emotional-and-mental-abuse/td-p/465386
PTSD-1255,Struggling to cope knowing brother brutally murdered ex-girlfriend,"Hi, I am new to online forums so I am not sure where to start. I have been working hard for the last 20 years to recover from a childhood of neglect and emotional abuse, and it’s consequences including severe anxiety and depression. In some ways I am doing okay now - I am married and have a son and getting back into some work after 5 years raising my son (and dealing with post natal depression and anxiety). But I struggle with a dark family secret - 10 years ago my brother brutally raped and murdered his ex girlfriend. I feel such intense shame and anger and sadness. I didn’t have a close relationship with my brother growing up (he was quite a selfish and cruel older brother). I haven’t visited him in prison because I feel too overwhelmed with anger towards him. I have spoken to psychologists over the years and it has help quite a lot. But I am really seeking a way to share the struggles with others who are in a similar situation...It is hard to talk to friends about this due to the shame attached. I keep going over in my head what he did to his ex girlfriend - and how he has shattered the lives of her family and friends.",Sarah_M,Community Member,02-03-2019,PTSD and trauma,9,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-to-cope-knowing-brother-brutally-murdered-ex/td-p/373247

I haven't worked now for 10 months due to mental illness. I was recently diagnosed with cptsd and severe dysthymia. I also suffer from ocd and have had a psychogenic often severe stutter since age 9. Between the ages of 8-16 my then stepfather was extremely abusive and aggressive to my mum, myself and my bro and sis. I suffered extreme physical, mental and psychological abuse on a daily basis for 8 yrs. I pretended for 20 years that i was ok even tho i knew i was drowning in severe anxiety and depression. Working is and has always been extremely difficult for me as i am so easily triggered. I have only seeked a psychiatrist a few months ago and i am going to a new one next month. I am going to apply for the dsp when i get a psychiatrist who i am comfortable with and willing to assist me. I have become extremely well educated re the dsp. Thankyou for reading.

PTSD-1257,Introduction Peter0LX - Psychotherapy treatment for mild complex trauma ,"Hello All, I was diagnosed with mild complex trauma about 3 months ago. I have had some really helpful psychotherapy which has made a big difference in my life fairly quickly. The main source of my problems was bullying and neglect by my father from when I was very young. I had some previous psychotherapy 20 years ago which more or less only scratched the surface but at least it prepared me for my recent therapy. I worked as hard as I could to get the most out of my current therapy. What we have achieved is identify some significant painful episodes in my life, stir them up to articulate what I would have really been feeling at the time but have never put into words before, and then disconnect the painful emotions from my memories of those past events. There is more to it than what I have just said here. I just want to say that it has worked very well. I liken the situation to me being a river, or perhaps river rapids, jammed with floating logs which represent painful memories. The therapy has enabled me to find the main hidden snagged log that was holding all the other logs back. Once we freed up that particular log, all the other logs started flowing downstream again. During later sessions, I felt that the now freely drifting logs jostled for position so that we could grab and deal with the most important ones. My treatment has been very interesting and worthwhile. That's all for the moment.",Peter0LX,Community Member,08-07-2019,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/introduction-peter0lx-psychotherapy-treatment-for-mild-complex/td-p/467169
PTSD-1258,The pointlessness of even trying,"My wife is my world, I know I am insane with the depth and unconditional nature of my love for her. I have been with my wife since 1998 and quickly learnt that she was traumatized from a childhood full of abuses, sexual, physical and psychological. Even to this day. Due to the ongoing nature of the psychological abuse, it is difficult to compensate for the unjust treatment my wife receives from her own family. Which is primarily due to the manipulation of her mother, telling her children to stay away from their mother due to her being dangerous and crazy. Which they have done. Her mother has found a way to commit the perfect crime and continues to do so. From my perspective, my wife's mother has damaged her to such an extent that her children have seen aspects of their mother that they didn't understand, that her mother caused and her mother used that behaviour to reinforce the illusion that my wife is dangerous. From my understanding of psychiatry, this is the typical type of situation patients have always been in. The victim suffers a trauma from a family member or care giver. That trauma is then denied by the guilty party and the victim is silenced through what ever means is currently acceptable as humane by the psychiatric profession. The reality is that the psychiatric profession have evolved to the point where they are literally above the law. My wife is currently being held against her will under a Section 30 and Section 46. My wife and I have spent the past six weeks coming off all the prescribed medication due to it possibly causing a new symptom of migraine storms. I have been caring for her palliatively without complaint or support. My wife had successfully come off all her medication and the migraines stopped. We were at the stage of getting her diet sorted when a kidney infection presented. She has a long history of renal issues due to the chronic abuse she suffered. My wife presented at ED, due to a possible reaction to medication she was put on 2 days earlier. My wife was in the middle of an antibiotic course for the infection. My wife's symptoms were interpreted as psychiatric. She is now a prisoner and getting worse. Both psychiatrically and medically. Fact: Psych patients have no rights. If you have a underlying medical condition with neurological symptoms, it will be misdiagnosed if you have a pre-existing mental health issue. You are also 350% more likely to die from oesophageal cancer if you have a mental health issue.

PTSD-1259,Hi there. I’m new here. My name is Jo and I really  need to talk about PTSD,"Hi. I was diagnosed with PTSD early 2000’s. My particular PTSD is a result of childhood abuse and adult violence. I’ve had loads of therapy over the years which has been a wonderful help. I’ve tried medications, meditation and a bunch of other things. Mostly it’s all good. But on occasion and I never know when, I am affected by something that sends me into an internal rage. On the outside I can appear calm or I can be aggressive in a way that causes my partner to become nervous. I have never been physically violent towards anyone but the energy I give off and the crazy manic head stuff going on inside me is definitely harmful to others around me.

PTSD-1261,Partner's past trauma impacting our present.,"I'm in a relationship with a guy who has been through a lot of trauma at the hands of his mother when he was a child. As an adult, he experiences severe depression, attachment issues, PTSD, anxiety, night terrors and dissociation (just to name a few). When he gets close to people emotions, good and bad, get the better of him. So he tends to try to push people away to avoid all emotion all together. Now that he's let me in, he's letting himself feel everything which includes all the bad stuff too. We love each other so much and we can be so happy together but when he has particularly bad night terrors or dissociates he immediately tries to push me away & starts saying things like ""this will never last"", ""this won't work"", ""I'm always going to be like this"". I don't know what to do. He's made a huge choice in letting me in, trusting me and sharing everything that he is with me but now he's in a state where he's giving up on us and I think he's trying to shut his emotions off again so he doesn't have to feel. How can I help him see that we can make this work? And how can I help him get through this pain that he's been dealing with for so long? He's so determined to do it all by himself without help from anyone. He's such an amazing person, I don't want to lose him.

PTSD-1262,Not really sure where to start,"Hi there, I am a 28 year old female and I have been suffering from depression, anxiety and a number of eating disorders since I was a teenager. All as a result of childhood abuse that I have never really come to terms with. I have seen a few psychologists over the years, but I have never tried medications. I tend to be pretty terrible at therapy. My depression makes me lethargic and my concentration is highly problematic. I really want to get better, but I am my own worst enemy. I self sabotage in almost everything I do. I have only been getting worse over the last few years and it has finally reached it's peak. I am more depressed, anxious and unhealthy than I have ever been and I am not sure where to go from here. I want to see someone, and I am seriously considering medication, even though I have been trying to avoid it. I don't see how I can anymore. My avoidance issues are largely why I am currently in this mess. I would love some advice, or even some support. I have a negligible support network, other than my husband. I find it incredibly difficult to make friends and when I do, I often mess it up. I withdraw and I lock myself away for months on end, where the only person I interact with on a personal level is my husband, unless I absolutely have to see other people. I am trying to find a creative outlet in writing, but only creative writing. I am awful at journals, partly why my therapy has always been a bit of a mess. Anyway, I am so happy that I found this site. I honestly feel like I need some like-minded people around to realize that there are far more people going through this than just myself.

PTSD-1264,EMDR and repressed feelings ? memories,"Hi I feel somewhat stupid asking this question so bear with me please. I suffer from depression and PTSD and I recently started EMDR with my psychologist to help with the trauma from when I was raped as a 12 year old. I have a strong and clear memory of it even though it was more than 20 years ago. The PTSD diagnosis is still only relatively new as I didn't disclose the trauma for several years, and even though I know the event had a marked impart on my life I struggled somewhat with the diagnosis because it made me feel like a victim, which I hate. After the first few sessions I keep having memories and thinking about this former family friend (who we're no longer in contact with and haven't been for MANY years). I remember being around him as an approximately 7-8 year old and being really scared of him. I just get this sick to my stomach feeling.......and I feel like something happened to me do with him when I was younger. Like, not rape, but something....inappropriate nonetheless. I feel kind of stupid bringing it up (and feel too stupid to bring it up with my psychologist) but I keep getting these flashbacks of being a young child around him accompanied by a really strong visceral reaction. Does anyone have any experience with this? I have a really strong feeling of....terror and disgust and persistent thoughts about it but its not like I can remember an EVENT or something. I don't want to be oversensitive or, I don't know, a hypochondriac about it, but I don't understand why I would be having such strong feelings about it or even thinking about someone I've had nothing to do with several decades, and have no reason to think of.",MilkandHoney,Community Member,02-07-2019,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/emdr-and-repressed-feelings-memories/td-p/454683

I need someone who has been through this or knows how to help me to guide me through this, I also want to know how I can get back in the good books of her family because they really did love me, and I loved them like my own family.

PTSD-1270,New - Here to meet new people,"Hi all, I am not quite sure what I am looking to find on here, but thought it might be nice to get to talk to other people in similar situations. I am a 28yo female. I have been suffering from mental health issues for a very long time now, having times where everything seems fine, then having very low episodes that just seem to come out of no where. My mother died of cancer when I was 12. I watched her deteriorate over a period of twelve months, and sat with her and watched her take her last breath. This is what led to my PTSD. I have struggled with PTSD, anxiety and depression from that point in my life. At 18yo, my boss at the time, attempted to rape me. I fortunately got away from the situation before it progressed too far. Later on in that year, I came out to my friends and family as a lesbian. I lost around 90% of my friends because of this, and family took quite a while to come around and accept me as who I am. My family are great with it now, and I have made some new friends who accept me. I have recently been diagnosed with polycystic ovaries and endometriosis and have been dealing with immense pains that have been affecting my day to day life. I have a lovely girlfriend who I know loves me, but I keep shutting her out because I don’t know if I can truly open up to her. She doesn’t seem to ever be affected by emotions, and doesn’t have much empathy for things she hasn’t experienced, so it’s hard to explain things to her. I am currently in a really low state of mind, and I just can’t figure it all out. My girlfriend keeps just saying that it must all be because my hormones are playing up.

PTSD-1271,"Advice, thoughts, opinions?","Hi all, this is the first thread. Ideas, any feedback would be appreciated. Background. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD about 3 months ago and in a marriage for 10 years or so. The marriage has ended. Not just due my PTSD but also other issues like my partners alcohol dependancy and treatment. On top of this we were seeing a family therapist. That fell through due to an infidelity disclosure on my wife's behalf. I see a therapist who's helping me understanding triggers and it's going really well. I'm engaged and am finding new insights about my trauma every week. My issue is around how I manage the separation. I'm interested in whether others have experienced similar? I've been living at AirBNBs and couch surfing for two months. I have a great network of friends and a closer circle who provide perspective. I'm managing it well. They have asked me to get more advice about my current situation. My partner was having an affair online with an old flame (facebook) which had been going on for a while. My instincts were to log onto her account (old password) This was a only a one time incident. It was unusual for her to be unsupportive, and use language that was so out of character, especially in a sudden way. She started labelling me as a 'Woman hater' and 'Abuser' whilst opening up around my therapy. Which seemed deeply out of character for anyone. Since then, she has blocked all contact apart from one email address. I've been told repeatedly that my 'Abuse' is unsafe. It's made it really difficult to arrange a time to get things like personal documents like passports, birth certs out of the house. I understand her worry, but not her motives. I've asked if she could hand them over to joint friend etc, she won't. Currently, she has all my essential documents. I can't get her to agree to a time to discuss it with me, whether it's with mediator or other. There are constant labelings of 'Abuser' 'Unsafe'. But no history of violence, no harassment at all. It has also come to light this week that the family therapist had contacted my trauma therapist to support the end of our relationship and the effects of my PTSD. My wife has met with our family therapist without me and stated that I was 'Disassociated' at the time of separation. This personal, clinical appraisal was then fed back into a session in my trauma work. Is this a breach of client confidentiality? And if so, how would you manage the situation? How would you progress re personal belongings? A",TheOwl,Community Member,22-06-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/advice-thoughts-opinions/td-p/435827

I have been married for 3 years and have a beautiful daughter and now i am expecting my second child with my husband. My daughter was born after a year we got married so things moved to another level very quickly. Just after she was born we started having these fights over small issues and at that time when I needed him the most he turned his back on me and then I found him cheating on me with two different persons. We moved from an other country so it was difficult living separately after a daughter but that whole 16 months time we were fighting. When I moved over here and found him cheating on me I asked him and he apologised and for the sake of my daughter I forgive him. But things got worse when he started abusing me and physically harming me. He did that twice and the third time he was shouting and throwing things his parents were here and i was expecting so i got scared and worried for my daughter so i called the cops. They threatened him and after that we had no connection. Whenever i try to talk and express something he ignores it or turn that to some issue. Whenever i try to convey my feelings he thinks its stupid and immature so i get no reply. I am trying my best for the sake of my daughter and my unborn but I don’t know where will it lead to.

PTSD-1273,I Feel Like I Am Cursed,"Hi Everyone, I just turned 30, I have 4 kids (3 boys with Autism and 1 girl), I'm a single mum and I work FT in Insurance. The events over the last 6 months have left me questioning if i believe in curses. Back in December a guy I seen casually left me physically injured after an assault when he went too far and got way too rough. I had known him for over 10 years and years ago I thought I loved him, but history aside its no excuse so injured and traumatised I went to the police and hospital and ended up with an AVO and he got a good behaviour bond. First i couldnt get out of bed for 2 weeks a mix of physical pain and panic attacks, i returned to work after christmas with only some pain that i just used panadol, neurophen and heat packs for. Then my wrist started aching really bad for days and days at a time. All while my back and shoulder had been aching ever since the start. So I started chiro, it was pricey but gave some relief. Then my jaw started, it ached on both sides, doctors gave me antibiotics. One amazing doctor prescribed medication which solved shoulder, back and wrist pain. Then in April Trigeminal Neuralgia struck, if you google that itll tell you its one of the most painful conditions known to man. Trust me ive had 4 kids and id rather do that over again than live every day this way. Trigeminal Neuralgia can be bought on by trauma. So Ive had more than a month all up off work since March and its not looking good but I have amazing bosses and I feel looked after. Its now May and going to be my 30th Birthday, because of my pain I keep trying to cancel plans with this guy I had been on a bunch of dates with but hes so persistant plus he has a strong pain killer from his knee surgery that might help, plus it wasnt meant to be the whole night just watching a movie or two and eating junk food. He picks me up and we head to his place and while driving he hands me the painkillers. We get there and he made me a hot drink and I had tim tams. Thats all I remember until he woke me up the next morning and he drove me home. I had a couple of explicit flashbacks and I realised I couldnt remember, days later he was arrested and they found photos and videos of things he did to me. The police were amazing and its still ongoing but hes not free. I feel lost, alone and confused, these dont feel like my memories, like its someone elses story. When will I get my happy life??",kb1nonly,Community Member,03-06-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-feel-like-i-am-cursed/td-p/494655
PTSD-1274,Killing me slowly,"Hi. I'm new here, so first thanks for all the posts on here, I have read quite a few and it is nice to not feel so alone. I'm posting because I really don't know what to do anymore. I can barely even recognize myself to be honest, I am definitely not the woman I used to be. My marriage is not very healthy. We have separated in the past and I just feel so stupid and weak now for getting back together with this man. When we first separated he attended counselling for his anger issues and also went to aa for 12 months. I was happy for him that he was changing himself for the better and was proud of him. I thought that he had proven he did want to change and stop his abusive behaviours and I thought I owed it to our family to give us a chance at being happy and together. That was a mistake.

PTSD-1275,Totally lost,"Where to start?, growing up I was abused a lot by my father, seems the only time he even looked at me was to beat me for something, even if it wasn’t my fault. I could never do anything right, even though I am the only member of my family who went right through school, I did not get in trouble, nor did I turn to drugs or alcohol. I did however end up with a problem with my temper, even as a young boy it seemed I got angry about things far too easy, I was also bullied a lot at school, right from primary all the way until I left school. I met a girl when I was 17 and got married at 19, with my first daughter being born just after I turned 20, we had 4 children in 8 years, yet I still had a problem with my anger, I scared my children and also my wife. then my 2 sons were diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy and given pretty much a death sentence. after 17 years of marriage my wife left me because I still had a problem with my anger, where the smallest things would set me off. Yet I still tried to maintain a good relationship with my children, my ex wife had turned them against me. After 2 years fighting her in court to be able to spend time with our children, she finally relented just in time for me to see my eldest son before he died. then 2 years later my youngest son also passed away. now here I am at 50 all my dreams of being a great dad and maybe being a great grand dad are gone, as my daughters can’t have children. I am in dire need of help, I am destroying my current relationship because I still have problems with my anger, is there any way that I can learn some coping tools to try and stop being so angry all the time? please help.",Lifehitsyou,Community Member,20-06-2019,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/totally-lost/td-p/433715
PTSD-1276,Does this ever end? Or just keep repeating itself?,"So tired of fighting every single day, I have no energy left and the mask of ‘ok’ is slipping further out of reach... Is it even worth the fight to get better? I worked so hard for about 10 years to get through cptsd and depression, celebrated when I finally got off meds and felt good! That lasted maybe 5 years... now back to fighting same demons - cptsd is back as is depression . I’ve been working with psych now for almost 3 years, gave up and accepted meds again 18 months ago but they didn’t seem to do much this time. Past 6 months under psychiatrist with meds increasing in dose and number but still struggle every single day just to do the little things. I have a fantastic husband and 2 wonderful little kids but I can’t seem to find calm or happiness, used to be so good at masking feelings but now that takes so much energy it’s just so hard. Seeing people/friends even for an hour results in exhaustion for the rest of the day - it’s too hard. Is it worth continuing to find that happiness or do we all just put in so much energy and effort only to go crashing back a short time later... maybe this is the life I need to accept... maybe this is what I deserve for not trusting those I loved all those years ago...

PTSD-1277,Should I stay or go.,"Ive been with my current partner now for 3 years and we have just recently go engaged. He has struggled with depression, anxiety, bipolar for most part of our relationship and I feel its finally taken its toll on me. He has days which are good and I forget about all the bad times but mostly its a constant struggle and fight. Im not sure how others handle their depression but my partner lashes out with abuse, constantly swearing and yelling at me. He has physically assaulted me at times. Im not looking for sympathy as i'm trying to understand him and what he's going through. He also gets very down and and upset. Ive had him in my arms sobbing, ive talked him out of self harm and suicide, ive taken him to the doctors for medication. Im at my wits end. I feel like I have done the best I can to help him through this, and I don't know if im strong enough to continue. I know that might sound selfish but I do not feel myself anymore.

PTSD-1278,Husband wants kids but I am hesitant because I had bad childhood.,"Hi, Me and my husband of 5 years marriage had been talking about having kids and every time we talk about it it, we ended up stressed and sad because he often said I am too negative for afraid of having kids. I came from an emotionally unavailable parents who often criticized me, calling me useless, good for nothing etc since I learned to understand words. I was physical abused by my parents too. I was also bullied at school and hardly have friends. I had low self esteem as a child and teenager, hated my self and at one point, wanted to commit suicide. I grew up watching my mum and dad yelling at each other almost every night and sometimes, it becomes physical abusive. Overtime, I had managed to overcome my childhood trauma and it don't haunt me or affect me much anymore. When I was younger, I always thought I will be a mother to prove my parents that I can a better parent and because I thought that is the only pathway in life. However, after marriage and reality kicks in and my biological clock is ticking, I grew fearful on parenting due to several reasons. First, my husband and I have no support from relatives because our parents and siblings are overseas (I don't even know anyone who have kids without any family support). Secondly, I am too afraid to lose my time & freedom, since I feel that I didn't have a good childhood, I naturally want to pursue my happiness in traveling, spending time with my hobbies and passion and not be burden by finance since we are not even earning average Melbournian wage. Thirdly, I don't have much confident that my husband can handle to stress, responsibility and work that comes with the kid maturely. Just a few years ago, he had serious mental health issues of self inflicting pain, suicidal thoughts, threaten me to suicide which I slowly managed to convince him to see psychologist to get treated and then did all my online research to support him. He seems ok now, but every now and then, when we have argument, he could say mean things to me, such as threats of divorce which he don't mean it because he is just throwing tantrum. Finally, went I see babies, I don't get that feeling that they are the cutest thing and I don't really enjoying carrying them. However, my only reason if I have a child is so that I can nurture him /her the knowledge in life and influence them positively. Should I still try my best to change to have kids for him? It is worth it?",Hikarue,Community Member,12-06-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/husband-wants-kids-but-i-am-hesitant-because-i-had-bad-childhood/td-p/503308
PTSD-1279, PTSD and personal relationships,"Six months ago I meet a wonderful lady ,she being near my age . I am 70 years old. We dated a number of times and as we got to know each other we slowly fell in love with each other . I must confess I'd never felt this intensity before , and realized she was my "" soul mate ' as I was to her. Let me say that my previous successes in relationships were not great. Often a see saw affair over a number of years. I did have an awareness that my troubled relationship with my very damaged mother(she was a holocaust survivor) was the contributing factor and had over the years tried various therapies but with little success. I accepted that's the way things were and most likely not a lot would change. Until my current relationship. I had gone into the relationship thinking that my love for this woman would perhaps overcome the painful memories and feelings relating to my family upbringing. This was not to be . Shortly after becoming intimate I had a complete breakdown (not hospitalized) and managed to pull myself from the brink with counselling, exercise ,yoga. I am still quite fragile and coping quite variably day to day. I have good coping skills having lived with anxiety y and depression for decades through membership of a number of helpful groups. What I discovered but had not clearly acknowledged that all along from the time of being a young adult was that I have been suffering from PTSD -due to the at times frightening behavior of my mother. So I am still in contact with this wonderful woman who has been incredibly understanding and we are keen to continue our relationship. But I know that these very powerful negative forces will undermine any meaningful connection eventually. I am seriously looking into effective therapies such as EMDR or any other. I would like some feedback on possible PSTD therapy strategies .

PTSD-1280,we can address childhood trauma,"Hi new to forum, believe in sharing will work if it's good two way communication. OK agree with what Julia Gillard suggested, but individual must be prepared to work through past issues/childhood trauma so learn to make a choice-stop being/playing the victim of dysfunctional families, abusive parents (verbal, physical, sexual, emotional abuse). Work with good professionals, friends, people who care and can share victories to leave past, start new chapter, better still a new book, just yours only, not all that ugly horrible family stuff.

PTSD-1282,No end in sight,"Hi. Im new here and reaching out feels like my last hope. My whole life has been filled with trauma. Im now 40 and over everything and just wanting to shut off from everything. Growing up I was moved around a lot so I have no childhood friends. My father had a nervous breakdown and was very critical and abusive. I was bullied a lot to the point I was blind and nearly lost my eyesight permanently in 1 eye. I lost my virginity being raped. I married the wrong person bc she fell pregnant and it may not be my child, who is now 16 and it breaks my heart she may not be mine. Sexually assaulted in my apprenticeship and assaulted. Workplace accident at 19 nearly put me in a wheelchair for life. Abused by bosses and ended up in court. Was also followed by private investigators. Got stuck in shit job after shit job. Smoked pot on and off for over 20 years bc of Pain, when I wasn't smoking it I was hooked on pain killers. Wife left after 17 years for another guy. Took eldest daughter. Became a single dad of 2 other daughters. This year alone I lost my job, my youngest got taken by her mother and not returned. I also kicked my new partner out who is still sticking by me. I've spent $11k on lawyers so far trying to get daughter back and have court next week for it. Also court this week over a car accident I had. And centrelink has rejected my newstart claim.

PTSD-1285,Stalker; feeling isolated and alone,"Starting back in 2012, i went into year 7. If that isn’t Scary enough, it was also the year I gained a stalker. As I’m changing and growing, I had someone watching my every move. Trust me, I never wanted it, or felt flattered. I felt so belittled and embarrassed, I couldn’t even tell my own parents. Fast forward to year 12 (2017) I finally told my mum after so many incidents of being followed and watched during school and one occasion out of school. My mum was so frustrated and empathetic towards me going through that and angered she went into school to talk to a deputy. This went well, as the stalking stopped almost completely! I didn’t have it in my thoughts constantly like I had during those 5 years. But now, 2 years on as if being anxious and depressed from those traumatic years of being watched and followed wasn’t enough. He’s back, at first I thought it would have to be a coincidence, seeing him drive past my house and look and smile at me, then as I drove he was parked down the street and followed me until I took a detour. Then he started appearing outside my work, again I thought there’d have to be another reason for it so I ruled it to be a coincidence again and again. Until last week when my neighbour came and asked if we knew someone who was parking outside our house in a car of his description, at first I said it would have to be a coincidence, until we had solid evidence that proved it was him, he had been sitting there at least twice within 3 weeks. I finally go to the police as I never thought it was a real concern and it was just strictly high school stalking. Now I’m just waiting to hear back from the police, I’m really struggling with it all, I’m super anxious, I’m taking measures to reduce my stress and remain sane. My parents don’t live near me and my boyfriend is away training at the police academy. If anyone could give me some advice and reassurance that would be amazing, I also don’t have any friends, so someone to talk to would be appreciated.",Shiloskeeper,Community Member,17-06-2019,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/stalker-feeling-isolated-and-alone/td-p/505083
PTSD-1286,Husband had me have sex with guys for money when he was out of work. Now I’m struggling with me..,"I’m so very embarrassed to be putting this out there for all to read but I need help. I need advice because I couldn’t even talk about this to a psychologist I was seeing at the time. I can’t forgive my husband for putting me through that horrible experience but at the time I agreed to do it to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table for our family. I HATED every moment! I felt my husband was too lazy to really work at finding a job. Instead he took an easy way out FOR HIM and stood by while I slowly lost all my morals, my self respect, my self esteem. I could see no other way out of the financial mess we were in. But it destroyed me, it destroyed my soul. That was about 3-4yrs ago now. In that time I left my husband for a year because life at home became unbearable for me. My husband is a FIFO worker now and I was dealing with our Bipolar daughter and a whole heap of other issues alone. I’ve tried talking to him about that time and how I’m finding it so hard to believe a man who truly loves and cherishes his wife would have her do such a thing! All he’s done is say he’s sorry and then brushes it aside. But I find I can’t forgive him. Am I being unreasonable? He makes me feel like I’m overreacting but it DESTROYED me! I want to leave him again but I’m trapped. I’m over 50 with no job. I can’t support myself and can’t expect the friend who housed me for 12 months when I left before to support me again. They are the only friend I have. I’m well and truly trapped and just want to run away. I know this post is all over the shop. There is so much more to this story. I guess what I’m after is clarification that my feelings about that degrading time are valid and I’m not overreacting? My husband seems to act like I should just move on and get over it but he wasn’t the one doing what I had to do. He wasn’t left feeling like a disgusting desperate person. He doesn’t have the awful flashbacks I have. I try and forget it ever happened. I try and keep it buried so I don’t have to think about it but I think I almost hate my husband for putting me through it all. My life is sad.

I had to learn how to slow down, rest and be calm. I've become so good at it though, life just passes me by while I waste away in my lonely home. What happened to the woman everyone knew would always step up to the plate when the proverbial stuff hit the fan? I'll tell you where she's gone; she's sitting on the bench! She's/I've forgotten how to fight. To be back in the game striving to win and make a difference hasn't been more important than now. I'm not 'there' for me! They say our MH needs calm, mindfulness and recovery. But what happens when recovery becomes habitual? Where's my passion gone? My will; my 'game'? I've fought the good fight to survive which meant healing my brain and learning who I am, who I've been and different ways to cope. It's worked like a dream. The kickback though has been addiction to isolation and laziness and, not a thought for who I want to be. I stood on my deck today with a cuppa questioning my decision to be this way. Sure, I'm safe and away from triggering influences, but at what cost? Something awful happened to my child and I didn't fight for him. I'll never come back from that. It seems I'm doing the same thing to myself. This is my conclusion. My once precious home has become my prison; items hoarded in rooms, untidy and even dirty. I'm ashamed. I started walking the deck; back and forth contemplating what to do. ""Just move."" came to mind. Getting back into the thick of it means risking my MH. Or does it? How far have I come?

PTSD-1291,Left an abusive relationship! Finally!,"Hey guys, I finally got the strength to leave a 9 year abusive relationship. I have never felt lighter! I am free! My relationship with my partner was physically and mentally abusive. He called me names, he pushed me, slapped me and even spat on me a couple of times. He put me in hospital twice. He always put me down, he manipulated me, he lied to me and cheated on me. Pretty much the relationship from hell and yet I loved him so much (crazy right?) He is a drug addict and that is what I always blamed for his abusive behavior. I knew what he was doing was wrong but I stayed because I loved him and told myself it was the drugs not him that hurt me. I have always considered myself a strong, independent person so I hid what my partner did from everyone because I was ashamed of myself for letting him treat me that way, I was embarrassed and angry that it had gone on so long. After I finally started reaching out to people (starting with my gp) I was so lucky because instead of being judged (which is what I feared) everyone was so understanding and supportive. No one put pressure on me to leave because it was ultimately my decision but they let me know that they were there for me. I wasn't alone. My partner decided to not come home or answer his phone one weekend and I decided enough was enough, he didn't even respect me enough to answer my phone call yet we'd been together so long?! I knew then and there that it was never going to get better so I packed my stuff and my pets, cried a lot and then moved out. I have not shed a single tear since. I wanted to share this because it was so so so so hard for me to leave, the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was the best thing I've ever done for myself. I didn't even realise that the relationship was consuming me and not in a good way. I thought about the things my partner did to me 24/7 and now I never think about that because I know it's over and will never happen to me again. If anyone else feels trapped in an abusive relationship please know that it only takes 5 minutes of courage to take that first step and tell someone. Tell a friend, a family member, your GP or any health care professional, reach out on this forum or send BB an email.

I'm not sure how to gather all my thoughts around this so please bare with me, this may be a lengthy post. I'm a 24/y F. I have been diagnosed with C-PTSD, however I am apprehensive. From the age of 3-7 my father suffered through cancer and eventually died. I can't remember any of those years, I think I was too young. Since then I have experienced a long-term emotionally abusive relationship, and I have been raped. Most recently my housemate's passed away. I was home but I did not find him, and did not see his whole body. I was witness to the smell which stayed in the house for a long time. I was interviewed by police and had the misfortune of informing his friends of his death. My psychiatrist has deemed the death of my father and the change in family dynamic as a child, alongside other traumatic events, enough to diagnose me with C-PTSD. While on paper I appreciate that this may be true, I feel as though maybe I wasn't truely traumatised by any of these events? I have had moments of dissociation, depression, extreme anxiety and fear, but rarely and very few flashbacks, and I feel like my diagnosis of C-PTSD isn't valid because of the way my traumas have manifested?? I don't remember being raped as such, I remember seconds before and some moments after while being interviewed by police. But I don't remember the act of assault, which makes me question whether it was really that bad? I have no memory of my fathers death, barely any memory of the funeral, and no memories afterward until about the age of 9. Was it really that bad? Could it be impacting me now if I can't even remember? I barely remember the incident with my housemate, but I know that it impacted me emotionally for a while afterward. It was not a personal loss, I didn't find the body. I don't think that what I experienced was enough to traumatise me. Last night in a cab ride home, I was overwhelmed with the thought that I was about to be raped and killed, I had a panic attack and cried for an hour after I got home. I know this isn't normal behaviour. But I don't know what to do about it? If I choose to explore my traumas with my treatment team, do I run the risk of resurfacing memories and being traumatised again? Maybe it's better off that they stay forgotten. I need some advice.",fillepetale,Community Member,03-06-2019,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/am-i-over-it-or-have-i-suppressed-it-c-ptsd-help-trigger-warning/td-p/492426

PTSD-1296,New and resurfacing Memories,"I’m wondering if anyone else has had periods in time where their memories about a traumatic event have started to resurface or become clearer. I have complex PTSD from multiple adverse childhood events. Last year I began to recall events in more detail and these triggered day time panic attacks from sensory triggers, flashback nightmares. I recall a psychologist saying something along the lines of (paraphrasing here) ‘when your brain is ready to remember it slowly opens up memories it had kept hidden to keep you safe and that is what is happening’. Now, 12 months later A conflict with someone close to me who was around during a Really traumatic time seems to have triggered a memory which I had pushed back and didn’t like thinking about - only now I seem to be reacting strongly to it and It has set off nightmares and emotions I didn’t want to deal with. Only, much like last time this happened, I feel like I’m grasping for a part of a memory I just can’t quite picture fully and in my nightmares it plays the same scene over and over always cutting out at the same bit. I feel like I must be being over dramatic or it must be my imagination if I can’t remember all of it. It is so distant it is like I’m watching it on a tv screen! Does anyone else have any similar experiences with memories and recall of traumatic events? Is this way of processing common for PTSD? I will be speaking to my psychologist about this, It is just sometimes nice to know we’re not alone in how we experience some symptoms.",FrancesG07,Community Member,21-04-2019,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/new-and-resurfacing-memories/td-p/432151

PTSD-1299,Hit and run crash. Can't sleep.,"Hi guys, I was driving to work on the 15th of May this year when I was T-boned at an intersection by an oncoming car that ran a red light. I then hit a light pole. I'm lucky that it was my passenger side that was hit and I'm even luckier that I only sustained whiplash and a dislocated hip. The last few nights I have not been able to sleep. I'm averaging about 3 hours. Every time I close my eyes, I can hear the sound of the car getting hit. I can remember the 3 or so seconds between the car getting hit and my car hitting the pole being eerily quiet and now I can't be alone. The car was stolen and the perpetrators fled the scene. I'm scared that they are walking around, I don't know who they are, they could be people I see at the local shops or a school mum. I just don't know. I don't trust anybody. I can't. I'm so paranoid.

PTSD-1300,"I only now learned that I may have, kind of been of raped five years ago?","So at my last psychologist appointment we talked a lot about sex as I've been looking more into dating lately. I haven't been with anyone in a few years and I have more negative than positive experiences. I also have little dating experience and get super anxious when it comes to intimacy for a combination of reasons involving body image, anxiety and trauma. I talked about these feelings as well as some physical concerns I have and that was all good, albeit kind of embarrassing; but it was when we were talking, in depth, about my negative sexual experiences that left me with a lot to process. There is a lot of awful stuff there, but there was one in particular she read through (I'd written them out in detail) that she referred to as rape that's really had me feeling super weird since. The situation she was referring to happened five years ago. I never forgot any of what happened or anything but it was always hard to recognise it for what it was because it wasn't something done with malice. It was one of those grey area situations. He didn't ask beforehand and I gave no indication of wanting to have sex, but it moved so quickly and I froze up. I didn't consent to what was happening but he did seem to genuinely think I was into it for some reason. Thing is, I never told him directly to stop or anything because I just couldn't bring myself to for some reason, even when he was hurting me. Its like I was too awkward and uncomfortable to make it stop, so I was just hoping for it to end soon. He also didn't think to check in and seemed to misread everything. I have found myself wondering briefly in the past ""was that rape?"" but I'd always quickly tell myself I was overreacting, but my psychologist put a bit of a different perspective on it for me. I was always quick to shut myself down because I was basing that question around his intent and labelling him & not on my own experience. She said, ""he may not have had malicious intent, but you didn't consent and that's what this is about."" She also asked how I would view the situation if it was someone else who had experienced that, and I did agree, a lack of no doesn't mean yes. She did also tell me that I didn't have to call it rape, but I would be justified in doing so if I did. Honestly, I still don't know, and I hate not being able to answer that question to myself. I'm not looking to have that question answered so to speak, but I would value others' insight in how they would deal with this sort of thing.",Scottish-Parrot_Jaimie,Community Member,27-05-2019,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-only-now-learned-that-i-may-have-kind-of-been-of-raped-five/td-p/481974
PTSD-1301,Stay with mum or move back in with dad?,"Hi um so I have a choice to stay with my ma or move in with my dad. I live with my mum atm but we fight constantly, backstory- when my parents divorced I sided with ma. It was very messy it was a long time coming my father had emotional and psychological abused her he’s very controlling and it all crumbled down after he hurt her, and threatened her whilst they were in an argument. Other terriable things have happened since we moved away so much so I don’t feel safe being happy. When ma and I moved away she promised a better life but ever since I’ve been house bound she’s called me parasitic and a leech, we fight constantly over the house not being clean enough and that I don’t do enough for her, I feel like she expects me to read her mind. I’m really forgetful psychologist have said it’s cuz of trauma and depression, I might also be on the septum. It can all be perfect one day and the next a screaming match cuz the floor isn’t clean enough. I’ve tried talking to her, asked for a list (cuz I know if I did it myself I’d still get in trouble) and I still get yelled at. She breaks things when she’s mad, threatened to take away my one coping mechanism and knows I’m frightened by loud noises. It feels nothing I do is enough unless I give up all my hobbies and become a maid We’ve really had enough of each other it’s really affecting my mental health, she’s even told me to leave move out, go back to my dad and I’m starting to think it would be a good idea. Dad and I fought not nearly as often and he was clear on what was expected of me yes his controlling behaviour is too much but I didn’t feel like I was walking on eggshells like I do now. I’m just really scared he’ll hate me now or try to turn me against ma, he also doesn’t accept I’m gay. Last time I was living with him my mental health was also pretty bad(I won’t go into details I don’t wanna trigger folks).

PTSD-1303,Part 1,"I was married for twelve years to a very abusive woman. She basically made my life a living hell. She was very controlling, used to fly into rages and scream and shout at me for hours. She was very jealous and possessive. I wasn’t allowed to have any friends She was also a hoarder, lots of OCD types of behaviour and generally a real nightmare. At the start of the relationship she was ok but over time she got progressively worse. I ended up leaving her and moving back to the UK and even then she wouldn’t leave me alone, claiming she was dying of cancer when she wasn’t. What made matters worse is I had a child with her. There were lots of issues with my son. Suspected Asperger’s syndrome. Now I really made a huge effort to help my son. I took him to private doctors for over two years but my ex wife refused to let me get him treatment so his behaviour just escalated. What made matters worse is my son inherited a lot of my ex wife’s abusive behaviours as well. So over time I had two very abusive people making my life a living hell. Twelve years of this made me a complete wreck that I barely survived. I ended up moving back to Australia because I felt so guilty not seeing my son. I am remarried and have a two-year-old daughter. My current wife did not want my son from the previous marriage in our home because initially we both tried very hard to build a relationship with him and provide him a stable home but he was pretty awful to both of us. He hit my wife and was incredibly abusive to both of us.",nick99,Community Member,29-05-2019,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/part-1/td-p/484221

I have almost out of body experiences, where I see something or hear something related to either my husband or father and think, ""hey, that should bother me or upset me"", however at the time it doesn't seem to. Without fail, every night when I try to sleep, I'll involuntarily replay events associated with their deaths or over think and am unable to stop.

We have lived seperately for four years now and we are still very good mates. We still have family dinners together every night mostly. He was a severe alcoholic. He did use to rough me up a bit until i fought back. He had a major health scare a few years ago and fell into a coma because of his drinking. He has since slowly started increasing his drinking again. However, he seems different more mellow. It is now very expensive as i have always financially supported him. The gov't money he receives as he cannot work is not enough for anything other than paying the rent. He wants to move into a place with me where he can have his space and i can have mine. Financially - its a fabulous idea, would save me a fortune, i could actually get in front of my car payments etc, but i dont know whether i want to give up my sanity by living with him again. I enjoy living on my own, peace and quiet. He does still ring me constantly at night time. Iwork fulltime also, so by the time i get home with my daughter its 7pm at night. I get very tired by the end of the week. So living with him again, would remedy that situation as well. There are pro's for living together...but i think my major issue with this is that i lose my independence again. IF he wants to talk shit all night long, as he likes to do, i won't be able to just hang up the phone, i will be stuck in the same house, and will have to get up and go to work, while he sleeps till lunch time.?

PTSD-1310,C-PTSD and a myriad of other items,"Hello there, 3 months ago I was diagnosed a Complex PTSD, with symptoms of bipolar and borderline personality disorder (and previously have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder). I've had a few months off work to get my head together and a few weeks ago, I started a new job in Federal Government. Whilst I had time off work, it gave me time to reflect on my life and have lovely conversations with my lovely and supportive house mate. I don't think my life has been that easy. Whilst I try to be optimistic and a silly sort of soul, deep down, there has always been anxiety and some level or filter of distress. The Psychiatrist (first time to see a Psychiatrist in my life this year) said that the matters I am presenting with (and also agreed by my psychologist) issues that relate to attachment and are from an early age.... I have always had tremendous caring responsibilities for 2 of my 3 sisters that have disabilities (from as early as 8yo). My father was absent emotionally, which resulted in this situation. Both my parents have mental health issues, it is suspected that my father is on the spectrum and my mother has a hoarding and gambling addiction. Parents divorced and a very complex history of court visits associated with the care of my 2 sisters. One parent declaring the other parent unfit. My father directs his internal anger about his behaviour towards my sisters with disabilities towards me. This has created a very insecure and fraught relationship. Intermingled with all of that, I was a victim of occupational violence in a workplace (over an 8 year period). I've also been sexually assaulted by a masseuse and a boyfriend when younger. And in a community role (over the last 9 months), I was significantly assaulted 6 times ..... time to take better care of myself....I won't mention the details because I don't want to trigger any readers..... I naturally am drawn to a caring role, to points of very unhealthy.....trying to have quiet time this year and working on fundamentally changing my patterns (I hope). In reading about CPTSD, I find the dialogue interesting about relationships where there is a power imbalance (is what has brought it about). I am starting to notice that I have this same trait in many friendships where I tend to put up with things for too long from others. I am not blaming the other people (I am responsible for my actions too)....just interesting to note how it all works.",Curleee,Community Member,25-05-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/c-ptsd-and-a-myriad-of-other-items/td-p/478277

PTSD-1312,Introduction and My Story,"Hi everyone, I hope I am posting this in the right section. I am a 39 year old male. I was sexually abused in my childhood (attempted rape) and later on I was groomed and assaulted through a Church member in my teenage years. I am only now coming to terms with the legacy these experiences have had on me. I battle addiction, usually porn and alcohol. My main reason for writing here is because I am overcome with guilt about the difficulties I have had in forming healthy intimate relationships. My relationship history is filled with lies, infidelity (on my part) and avoidance of intimacy. I hate that this is how I have been. I am overcome with the guilt of it all. I believe I have a really good heart and am a kind person, but so many ex-partners think I am a horrible due to my actions. The thing is, looking back, I don't even know what drives me to my behaviour. It almost feels like a dissociative state, in which part of me shuts down. I don't feel I can say no to others and have proper boundaries, and am always trying to please others. Anyway, I know this probably doesn't make sense. I am recently married, and am hoping to make a new start in my life. I have recently moved cities in an attempt to begin doing things differently. I have hurt many people and my guilt and shame have destroyed many relationships. I am hoping someone here will know something of the chaos that can come later in life as a legacy of sexual abuse.

PTSD-1313,I wasted my life and I want out,"I am an only child. Grew up in middle class household. Never been poor, but couldn't afford lots of luxuries. My father drunk quite a bit and spent time with his friends, roaming bars, more than with mum and I. I really hated my father's drinking. Not only that he never accepted the fact that he was a drunk, he would come drunk to my school for parent-teacher interviews and that really made me sad. I was a geeky girl (straight A student) and whilst I was never bullied or unpopular, I was not popular either (I was nothing). I asked him numerous times not to be around me nor talk to me when drunk, he'd promised numerous time he won't and he'll stop drinking, and...continued as usual. Sometimes he'd say he would've liked me that I was a boy; he would then stop drinking and do boy's stuff with me. My mother was pretty much there to support my dad. Whilst he worked all of his life, 90% of his income was going to satisfy his needs: drinking, catching up with drinking buddies, travelling (by himself!), cars,... My mum worked full time, too, and she paid for roof over our head, bills, food, my needs,... We never traveled anywhere as a family, other than visiting our extended family and staying with them. My mother's priority was to maintain peace in the house. When dad came home drunk, I was sent to my room; when he started yelling, I was told not to respond or cry and just retreat to my room. They would then go to their bedroom, have sex, he'd fall asleep and my mum would come to get me from my bedroom (unless I was asleep which I often pretended to be, especially as I got older, because all of that disgusted me). My father subsequently stopped drinking when we found out I was carrying a boy, literally overnight - I came home from the hospital, told them I'm carrying a boy, he got up and threw away every single bottle containing alcohol, including low grade rum we used for baking. He didn't want his grandson to ever see him drunk and he never had a single drop of alcohol ever since and would preach to everyone and anyone... My ex and I met at the age of 17. Got married really (really!) young. Looking back, I felt I was his 'meal ticket' all these years - out of 30 years together he probably worked 10 years. I don't know why I stuck around when all of our arguments usually ended with ""if you don't like it, we can divorce"". I really didn't want to divorce. That is not what real wives and mothers do. I always tried to find the excuse for his behaviors. I am really boring. I have been working full time from the age of 17 and cannot remember every being out of work except for maternity break. I am lucky in my line of work and have always managed to prioritize my children. I like spending time at home, cooking, maintaining my home, spending time with family and friends. I used to like going out, too, but often when we'd go out, he'd have few drinks and start putting me down...silly things like having a big nose (it's not, but it's not little feminine nose the way he likes it), being a bit thick in the head (I'm not, I have mathematics degree, I'm not dumb, we just may not be on the same wavelength and generally my point of view is a wrong one), derogatory things about my extended family (my extended family is colorful but that is not my fault and definitely no reason to bring up as a topic of conversation). When he's sober, I'd bring it up and he'd start yelling at me that I'm a cow/idiot/...'insert any derogatory name' and that I'm too sensitive. I often tried to justify his behavior because he used to tell me his father was quite physically abusive when he was a little child, until the age of 15: he got drunk because he was unhappy - how can I make him happy? (I didn't realize at the time that no-one can make you happy...happiness is individual and internal) he smashed the house (tore of the ceiling in the dining room)/furniture/dishes - we better be quiet when he comes home I said 'no' and he continued on, calling me frigid 'derogatory name' after I couldn't stop crying woke me up by abusing me because he had a dream that I cheated on him harming our 7 y/o because he was sleeping next to me because of nightmares refusing to pick up our sick 13 y/o old after she missed her school bus because he was playing cards across the town (not working at the time) and when she started crying, told her to call the bus company and complain so they can organize transport for her whenever I cook something, he'd compare it to his mother's/grandmother's/aunt's/... cooking or he would 'hoover' in the kitchen to tell me how to do stuff - I'm no Nigela by any stretch of imagination but I quite like cooking and prepare healthy and hearty meals that people (and most importantly my children!) really like to eat he hated when my parents came over and perhaps offer an advice (as all parents do) - admittedly my father was not the easiest person to live with he didn't like my friends because they were gay/fat/poor/...and any time spent with them was a waste and not something a respectful wife and mother should do ................ Number of people in our community (friends/acquaintances/people we see in church...) commented how they would really like to form friendship with our family but they found him hard to deal with. Subsequently he stopped drinking but started behaving 'holier than thou' when offered a drink... We divorced 15 years ago but he remained living in my house with our kids because he didn't have a place to go, our child got seriously ill, etc. I supported him and his hobbies...hunting, fishing, boating,...but grew unhappy with every passing day, to the point of crying and having borderline panic attacks on my way home from work. He then decided he didn't want to be in the same bed with me. He moved into the spare room. He spent every waking moments on his hobbies or computer games, usually sitting around in his underwear (when in the house). We grew more and more apart. Or perhaps - I grew more and more resentful of everything: my life, my letting him get away with shit that I shouldn't have,.........Whilst we grew apart as a couple, we remained civil and didn't argue with each other. I tried to talk to him number of times to at least help me with house chores and cooking because he is in the house all day every day. He usually refused, saying that he won't pick up after MY children (they are OUR children) and even if he made/order food, he'd do it for himself only. I had enough and asked him to leave. He did. He inherited a house 1 months ago on the other side of the state so he moved there. He only receives small income (enough for basic lifestyle) so he wanted me to help him with some bills. I have. He wanted me to visit. I have. He wanted me to help him with the move. I have. He introduced me to his neighbors as his ""Mrs"" and is trying to persuade me to sell my house and move in with him. I don't want to and feel guilty for refusing him. I can see myself living in that beautiful little town. But not with him. When I think about, potentially, going to bed with him, I have a knot in my stomach. We do not argue. We talk as friends. I have an old house, it needs either major renovation or knock-down rebuild. I don't have money for that. I can sell it and downsize. I still work full time. However, I hate my life. I hate the fact that I wasted it. I hate the fact that ALL my life I try to please people around me, support them (financially and emotionally) and I am now empty and have no-one to support me (emotionally). My parents passed away. One of my children passed away. I am finally alone, at a dusk of my life and I have no will to continue. I would like to go dancing/travelling/skiing/...I have no energy/will/motivation to do anything. I like people watching. I like watching couples, exchanging glances at each other, holding hands, .... I feel I have so much to give, but no-one wants it. No-one wants me. I am no-one. I am seriously struggling to find a single reason (other than my children) to remain alive. I don't want to do it (commit suicide) but I really am tired of being no-one to anyone.",susiecaramel,Community Member,01-11-2018,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-wasted-my-life-and-i-want-out/td-p/369878

PTSD-1317,Hanging onto dear life. Hello,"Hello world, I'm someone who - naturally happy, has had my life destroyed. I believed in a friend, who turned out to be a bad man. I married him on a whim, believing he would be wonderful. He turned out to have more skeletons in the closet. Domestic abuse, alcoholism, drugs and mental disorder from his side came to light. On top of that, an eccentric narcissist. I fell pregnant, didn't abort. I considered leaving him, but he wanted us to be a happy family. Until I discovered he cheated on me, and was secretive. No only that, but only a week after our girl was born (a little girl he first wanted me to abort) he became possessive. I had the baby early and for several months in hospital my little girl had to fight for her life, as I had to face my demonic ex husband. He caused my hospital time with my girl to be trauma, and not only that but now I have lost my freedom. I'm living with my Auntie here in Australia, but my parents and family are all in France. I so desperately want to go to France with my baby girl, and I cannot even leave this country - he didn't give me permission. My career over, my dreams lost, my freedom gone, my pregnancy unpleasant, my marriage a disaster, my bank account depleted. My parents will be coming to Australia soon to help, but they can only stay for so long. My who life is over, it's destroyed by one man, one mistake. I feel like I have no hope, like I have ruined my life. My husband claimed he'd move to France with me, my parents purchased an apartment close to theirs for us, decorated... and I have never even had the pleasure to step foot into a gift, an expensive gift. I'm so destroyed. I'm so lost. I have physically aged at least 2 years when I appear on photographs, my birthing was a c-section so my physical strength and love of the gym is on a long hold and I just feel like I have died. I'm scared of my ex-husband taking the fragile baby to his hands as he is not a normal good man, and my baby girl, I'm honestly fearful of her safety around my ex-husband not to mention his parents. My ex's sister is a psychologist, my ex's father is a surgeon, my ex's mother is a pediatrician and they are all knocking on my door and trying to get to the baby. I am sick too, have hardly slept, they tell me we are to share the baby and they have plans for her future. I feel like I don't count. My Auntie is stating she will now refuse to let them into our home and I'm scared. Do I have a future? Will it ever get better?

PTSD-1318,"10+ years married, kids, leaving, anxiety, abuse","I have been married over 10 years and we have a gorgeous family together. There were some red flags at the start of the relationship, but he was also the most loving, caring person I had ever met, and he made me feel amazing, always had my back and we made plans for our future. On and off I saw his hysterical/tantrum side, but it always followed with apologies and promises. He picked the wrong girl to try to stand over though as I'm not a submissive kind of person.. At the start I would try to calm him down with reassuring words but soon realised that this never worked when he was in a rage. So years later whenever I saw this behaviour I'd roll my eyes, tell him off and/or walk away. When he has tried to stand over me physically I would retaliate with a rage much more furious than his so this side of him never escalated much further. He has settled a bit over the years, but still there's ups and downs.. he goes from having pure contempt towards me, calling me names, saying I'm disgusting and he hates me to then apologising again and making promises again. He was busted on a dating site over a year ago, and when I kicked him out there was the fear that he was suicidal, and anyone that phoned him got a blubbering mess of a man who could barely get a word out. I took him back. He made promises, said he'd see a psychologist about his issues. Weeks went on and it never happened, I kept asking for him to see someone but he never did. I've threatened to leave him MANY times, and when I say it I 100% mean it... but each time he manages to convince me. It has been different the past 2 to 3 months. I had a massive panic attack a few months ago and started taking a daily anxiety pill.. Prior to this I had a couple panic attacks, but smaller ones which I never thought were much of an issue. I never thought I was actually suffering from anxiety as I am happy with my life other that a roller coaster relationship, and sometimes I work too hard and forget how to wind down. I've continued to feel better everyday since seeking help, and my thought process is clearer. I REALLY intend on leaving my husband. I have spoken to my psychologist about it, and have started looking at rentals. BUT there is that tinge of guilt and when I watch him playing and cuddling his kids I still see that beautiful side to him.. It's such a shame. There's no trust. There's a lot of broken promises. The thought of leaving him makes me feel like a weight has been lifted.",Lou100,Community Member,14-05-2019,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/10-years-married-kids-leaving-anxiety-abuse/td-p/468315
PTSD-1319,Panic attacks,"Hi, I have been really struggling all week with feeling exhausted and a lot of this depression resurfacing I think is because of panic attacks. My abusive ex-partner always tried to control me and say I had to follow what he said or he would physically hurt me and get angry, sometimes try to kill me when his anger outbursts got really bad. I then just go into a state of panic. I am just feeling really fearful even after having relocated and scared of him. I overheard his family saying how they were going to try to take me to civil court and how they wanted me to die. I am constantly feeling in fear. He told me he knew my patterns and how I worked and would find a way to control me. I do not want to go to police because I am really scared of these people. Does anyone have any experience with dealing with panic attacks? I am in a constant state of depression because I am sickened by how these people have got away with what they have done and not only that but ganged up together to cover it up. Does anyone else live in fear like this after being threatened and abused? Does it ever get better? They are just so sick. I feel exhausted because they were so sick and tried to kill me and hide it.

PTSD-1321,Received low grade at uni.,"Hello Everyone, I am just needing to touch base and get assistance from others in putting my thoughts in perspective. My history involves sexual abuse from step father for most of my childhood. Unable to complete high school and constant bullying. Today I am happily married with three kids and I’m trying to complete uni. My goal is to become a teacher so I can provide extra income and take the family on holidays (single income family atm and life is hard) I am reaching out because I feel like I am drowning in emotions right now. I am stressed about finding time to complete 4 units this semester while trying not to panic about our financial situation. It has become all to hard today when I received a low grade for my last assignment. Panic is now setting in that because I can’t achieve high grades I won’t be employed after I finished my studies. I fear that I will find it hard finding a job because I will be judge by my abilities. It feels easier today just to quit. I also feel like the enjoyment of learning has been sucked out by my constant need for perfection that it’s taking its toll. I find my self over analysing the question breaking it down and stewing on and when I get 65% I feel absolutely devastated. how do you go through uni without worrying and letting it taking over your life? I guess if there’s a crystal ball that will tell me that my future job outlook is not determined by my grades I would be slightly relieved but instead I constantly hear that many teachers that finish uni are unable to get a job. This makes me feel like that I’m in a flock of birds fighting for survival. I am doing this so I can provide opportunity for my family. The last thing that I want is to find my self jobless after 4yrs of blood sweat and tears!! Well typing this has made feel a little better. But my inner self still feels Iike I can’t succeed unless I achieve high grade still bothers me. Look forward for any feedback or suggestions. I wish I had a mentor but I don’t.

PTSD-1322,Self Help And Therapy,"I am diagnosed with having Complex PTSD. I went through dissociation and psychosis as young as 6 yrs of age, possibly younger. My story is a long one so I won't go into details. However, if you find therapy alone unhelpful, then you could try a combination of self help and therapy. For me, the problem with therapy is that it is never as available as those who are suffering, truly need. I get parts of my memories and emotions associated with it, brought to the front of my mind. But at the end of the therapy session, there is no method to put those memories to the back until the next appointment. I go home full of questions and old aches. Therapy alone for me is the equivalent to putting a bandaid on a school sore. The infection is covered, risk of spreading is contained. BUT, underneath, it is still infected and is still sore. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; if your reading and writing skills are okay, then I suggest asking your therapist about this type of therapy. It gets you to focus on how to manage your mental health. To put things into a view that you can accept and live with. As a victim of long term abuse and almost 40, I will say this. My memories have never faded. They are permanently etched into my brain. Because I couldn't forget, I accept my memories and turn them into lessons that taught me something vital. Because I still can't dull the pain, I try to use my experiences to be there for others who aren't coping and so, I turn my pain into strength. Because innocence stolen cannot ever be given back, I stopped trying to get back what I had stolen from inside me. I use what happened to me to try and be more wise and aware and to prevent others from being hurt too. Rather than, hopelessness, defeat and suicide, I choose to be a protector of innocence. CBT alongside a therapist can do wonders I believe. I think of it as retraining my brain. I am very honest in my answers because I am talking to myself rather than a psyche. I have no reason to lie to myself. What has happened has happened and cannot be undone. I don't like wasting my energy and time on questions that can't be answered and problems that can't be fixed. I prefer to concentrate on what can be answered and what can be fixed. And talking about and bouncing ideas for, self help with a professional helps me keep things safe and in perspective. If you are like me, then you are at risk of being overly resolute. Refusing to change your thoughts or beliefs.

PTSD-1325,Past experiences haunting my relationships,"Hi, I would love some advice as I feel as though my friends are sick of my mood swings and don’t understand what I am trying to say. I promise this isn’t just me ranting about my non-existent love life. A guy I like recently added me on fb and started messaging. From the times that I have met him in person I’ve been incredibly drawn to him and he seems like such a kind guy, but, I started to freak out. Getting messages from him was amplifying my anxiety, I was getting chest tightness, nausea and losing my appetite, going nights without meals because I couldn’t stomach it, but I still wanted to talk to him. I ended up asking him what his intentions were and said I wasn’t ready for a relationship as I currently have just started seeking a psych for previous sexual assault and have had bad experiences with obsessive men (I did not disclose these details to him, rather that I had been just having bad anxiety due to previous experiences and that wanted to clear the air so this wouldn’t blow up in my face again) and I thought he would be understanding. Instead he left my messages on read and removed me as a friend on fb because I had essentially ‘rejected him’. I received a message from him today saying that I was ‘too rough’ and he didn’t want to be the ‘cause of anxiety or drama’. This really hurt because I was hoping to talk things through with him, that he would be understanding. I didn’t want to stop speaking to him I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page about not being interested in relationships. He is a health professional (this is how we first met) so I thought he would be more empathetic? It’s made me feel so shitty about myself. I’m embarrassed and I feel so low, not to mention my anxiety is still how it was when I was talking to him. I dont know what I’d do if I see him at work and I just feel so crushed and worthless. None of my friends understand because I ‘barely’ knew him but I think what has me upset most is that this will always happen. The reason I am so weary is because I boy in high school I said I just wanted to be friends with ended up threatening to kill himself “because of me” and blamed me for wanting to die. I didn’t want to lead this guy into thinking I like him (which I do) but turn around as I got to know him and realise I don’t, and then have him follow the same pattern. I dont know if posting in this forum is even the right place to post this but I didn’t know what else to do.

PTSD-1326,How to get over the guilt,3 years on from when i was strong enough to leave a 10 year 3 children DV relationship. He went to prison for 3 pitiful months only to receive a 21 month suspense sentence all thanks to the reference letter from his new gf. 6 months later he broke that bond by horrendously attacking his gf and her elderly father. 2 years on and it's crunch time. I was asked to stand up in court. Here's the issue 2 years he did have any contact with our children then the phone call with him telling me what he did again...cautiously I kept communication open and established a small connection (no child contact) I'm an enabler. I thought he had changed not completely but was conscious of his actions. 6 months later I reestablished his relationship with his children (even though the kids didn't agree) all because I didn't want the repercussions years down the track from teenage kids resenting me for keeping their father away. Things went ok but each drop off was he'll kids screaming etc. 12 months in and everything changed I noticed he wasn't handling the kids when he had them then my worst nightmare he physically touched my 10 yr old son. I was so angry and cut all ties until he sorted the court case. Turns out the prosecutor is chasing jail time. I want him to be punished and to stop him from hurting others but I'm scared of the reorecutions if he is not incarcerated. But above all I feel guilty even though I think he is dangerous and I can't get over it and I don't understand why.

PTSD-1331,"Terrified and feeling very alone, isolated","Hi, I'm an expat living with my best friend. Things have become sour between us for many reasons. My reasons are he suffocates me, never respects when I say no, doesn't listen or respect my 'why's, he isolates me and when I try to say this is why I need space, to breathe, he becomes unhinged. Each day is drama at some point with him even though we go places, spend 18 hours a day (I can't be alone from him cus I'm his guest and we live rural so, I'm stuck!), We do everything together and yet he still needs a daily dose of drama. I have my 1 year old with me, too. I came to this country to heal from my traumas left in another country, he offered to support us. Well, to deflect the issues I have with him and my sadness that's getting heavy from his weight on me, he began to complain about me, then yell at me. This has become 'often' and I usually walk away and take my baby into our room. This time, after saying I can't live with this anymore, I'll buy my ticket out of here then, he said Go. Not just that, he said pack your bags and now and go. I said I have nowhere to go. He became a monster. Raging for me to go, now, anywhere, into the rural Forrest with my baby for all he cared. Then, he called his sister saying I'm irrational and he wants me to stay. Shes gets on the phone, hears what I have to say then I hand phone back to him. Next I know, they are BOTH telling me to pack and go NOW. She then told me she didn't believe her brother was abusing me, get out now, then each texted me to go, I am not welcome. They each k ow I am a domestic violence survivor, I was tortured in USA until I escaped, lived homeless for a year, I fought hard to prosecute me now ex. These 2 people who I trusted have retraumatized me now!!! I called shelters and eventually my friend said to stay but now I'm so depressed and shock ip from that, indnt even want to come out my room cus when I do, I can't smile. Or we argue because I said him and his sister abused a very fragile person who I thought they loved us....who throws a best friend with baby out into the unknown?! No car, nothing.......and they each claim they never wanted us to go. Icing on cake, insane!! I got texts, I know what was said. Each refuse to apologise. I smile for my baby and play with her, but he's shown her now what disfuction and depression is.

PTSD-1332,PTSD and Trauma - Question,"Hello, Is it true that if a person has suffered loss like the death of my daughter to still birth at 8 months old inside my tummy, two years later my husband to another woman and the loss of all familiar connections due to this that this trauma can develop into a high sensitivity to loss of any kind and to people in general? I have sought many sources to find out just what is going on with me from all of this. The past feels like it is constantly replaying the feeling and the scenes and I sit here in my lounge room wishing I could know how to being comfortable and secure in my own company and in the company of others. I so fear losing those I feel connected with, that I tend to not form any deep connections with people. And those that do develop into connections with I fear that I will attach myself to them.

PTSD-1333,Continuing saga,"Its been a while since I last posted I thought I was over it but no the anger resentment , frustration ,self loathing ,are all still there just under the surface. Yesterday I had to attend a view, organised by my legal team ,attended by a lawyer representing the other side ,and the company and their item that contributed to my injury. This goes back nearly six years ,and we get there and the item for view isnt close to what contributed to my injury, I walked towards it and wanted to smash it apart ,my lawyer told me 4 times not to do what I did ,my wife got in my face and told me I was stupid ,the smug representative and site manager smirked and smiled ,all the way home I copped an earfull ,and it just got worse at home. I have never wanted to hit someone more ,my angers out of control ,I get told there wont be a judgement till March or April next year. Since 2015 I havent had an income and have to live of my wifes wage ,before that I was getting the 75% of my pre injury wage ,after 130 weeks nothing from workcover , the only reason I am still here is because I would miss my wife and kids , it has got to the stage where I wonder if its worth it. My wife says I always show people a happy face and only she gets to see the real me. And then last night she said she thought we should seperate. Great. Another nail to add to my coffin, I really want to stay around and screw the 2 insurance companies but I dont know if I want to face it. Next week my Daughters getting engaged, the Monday after I go under the knife for my 19th surgery, 2 Drs have recently suggested an amputation . I have no money to give for the engagement, I'm scared about the upcoming surgery , and my good friend PAIN is still with me constantly. I really feel like I am self destructing, when I see something I want to step in ,not caring about myself. Sleep is not happening I lie in bed and feel the weight on my chest restricting breathing , sitting here ,typing this ,doesnt help either, like it used to .I have to go to centrelink and see if my disability pension has been approved ,bet it hasnt, and that just adds to my depression. Isnt life wonderfull for those with a problem in their lives people dont care they look at you and nod but really think your milking it I even blew up at a little old guy who was pulling out of a disabled parking spot because he didnt have a label he pulled 1 out of the door pocket ,bet it wasnt his, I am just angry at everything and everyone.",Wraith,Community Member,09-11-2017,PTSD and trauma,46,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/continuing-saga/td-p/319793
PTSD-1334,Ptsd and being in a relationship,Hi everyone this is my first post but after desperately searching for some information about how my ptsd impacts my relationship i thought id reach out here to people that have ptsd and are in a relationsip. Im very aware that i struggle with feeling... Does it make sense to anyone else that has ptsd that you know you love someone (know in your head) but dont feel anything? I battle within myself constantly questioning myself...asking can it be love if i dont feel anything? Can i shut off and feel nothing and be in love with him? How do i know if im in love or not? obviously i dont feel i could talk to him about this when i dont understand it myself..plus how can i talk to him say these things without completely hurting him... I didnt have ptsd until age 25 so my relationship pre ptsd was NOTHING like the one i have now with ptsd...i dont understand my feelings or emotions and how i meant to know if im in love with him...we have been together 2 years so its not a new relationship. I would really value anyones help who can relate or has some knowledge of where i am coming from and how to accept or understand this and know if its love or not:/,Scooba,Community Member,09-04-2019,PTSD and trauma,12,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-and-being-in-a-relationship/td-p/425400
PTSD-1335,Struggling with stalker ex-boyfriend,"Hi all. First time poster so I'm a bit nervous.. Last year I've had to deal with my ex-boyfriend stalking me and not leaving me alone after we had broken up. Long story short he had messaged me non-stop, trespassed into my house late at night to knock on my window and have visited me at work a few times up until I was fearing for my safety. I finally managed to get in contact with the authorities and have managed to get a personal safety intervention order in November. For the most part it felt very surreal at the time and I didn't think that I could fully embrace what was happening. I keep thinking that he could just show up at my house any time of the night. I couldn't sleep at the thought that he would knock on my window again at 3am in the morning. This would go on for many nights throughout the week. Because I still live with my parents it was hard to tell them that I think I needed to see someone about what was happening to me as they don't really believe in counselling. Up until now I feel like I've been repressing all these thoughts and feelings that now I feel like it's all slowly catching up to me. I feel even more constantly paranoid before going to bed and now I think it has gotten worse to the point where I can't sleep with the lights off. I've spoken to my friends about what has happened but I feel like now that some time has passed everyone else has moved on from what has happened but I'm still stuck. During the day I feel like it isn't as bad but once I'm in bed at night is when I feel the worst. Sometimes the smallest sounds or breeze of wind from outside would keep me up in thinking that what if it's him hanging around my backyard.. I feel embarrassed that if I go see my GP it feels like I've left it too late. I've had to take time off uni and I'm just really struggling since I've never had to seek out help before and it's all so new and daunting I wouldn't even know what to say. Thank you so much for taking even a bit of your time to read my post.",annawave,Community Member,24-03-2019,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-with-stalker-ex-boyfriend/td-p/402026
PTSD-1336,Psychologist told me being a victim of DV was my fault,"Hi, I’ve just left my first session with a new psychologist and i’m feeling so upset by what he said that I needed to post. After detailing my relationship history with my husband which has been marred by over a decade of verbal, psychological and more recently physical and sexual abuse, I was told that if I don’t leave after he has shown me his true colours then I am just as responsible for the violence that may be inflicted on me. He also told me that the problem was our “dynamic” was wrong and that if my husband was with someone else then he probably wouldn’t be violent. i’m absolutely flabbergasted that a mental health professional would have these opinions. They seem so outdated and dangerous to me. I didn’t speak up at the time as it took a while for what he said to sink in. Now i’m back to blaming myself for what has happened to me.

PTSD-1337,Realising I have PTSD,"Hi I’m new here and I’ve just today realised I have PTSD (self diagnosed) Background: my parents divorced when I was I think 7 and it was a really messy divorce that multiple times needed to be worked out through court. I was also molested by a family member around the same time. (I’m now 18) For as long as I can remember I’ve had anxiety, it started off with me just being very shy then it developed further. I only realised a couple of years ago that it was just more then me being shy. It was only last year when I realised I also probably have depression, I can’t really remember how it started it just kind of did. I do remember feeling really unhappy for a long time though. I have figured for a while that my anxiety and depression had stemmed from my traumatic childhood but I had never thought of putting a label on it until now. I never used to consider that I had PTSD because I never thought that what I had been through would be considered traumatic, even though I have always felt traumatised by what had happened. I’m considering seeking help from a doctor but even thinking about it makes me anxious, I do need help though. I’m not really sure why I decided to write and post this, I guess I just wanted some form of support.

PTSD-1341,"Terrified of Belonging, Unable to Enjoy Anything or Feel Happy","Dear Community, I need help. This is my first post. I have lost who I was and is so hard to move forward into who I want to be. I'm barely getting through my days. I feel terrified and blocked to belong here. I came to Australia 2 years ago from North America, and met the most wonderful partner. I had a physically and emotionally abusive family growing up and quickly learned to be independent. I healed over 15 years by studying meditation and other therapies. I even feel others do that. After I moved in with my partner, everything changed. I remembered something awful about what happened. I remembered a worse trauma than I thought I had experienced, of sexual abuse and my life physically being threatened at age 4. I thought I would die. And more than one caretaker/parent witnessed and didn't protect me. So now I understand why I have rejected belonging. It's so hard to trust my partner. He's very loyal and patient and loving, and intellectually I know I can. After a lifetime, 34 years of rejecting belonging for what I now see as good reason, i'm being blessed with an opportunity to create a new chosen family. And I just can't seem to do it. It's been 9 months of processing this memory. What was first blissful true love now feels like constant fear, terror, panic. The more he loves me, the more my body wants to reject it. I want to trust feeling good in belonging, but all I've ever known is family who betrays you in every way, by almost every single one of them. I literally can't enjoy my favorite things anymore, dancing, feeling others, being with my partner. Its really disheartening. I'm afraid this will go on forever. I've been working with mindfulness, affirmations, writing. I've worked with 3 therapists since I remembered spending 5k in 6 mos. It's too much. And not enough progress. accepting the pace is terrifying. I'm 36 and I want kids too. I just can't see putting a child through this and I can't see an end to the heaviness. the hardest bit it remembering who I was when we first met just a couple years ago, so happy, so vivacious, so fun. I'm missing enjoying these moments with my love, they are passing me by. I'm losing time. I feel powerless. It's awful. It's like I'm wasting all of this because I can only feel and think negatively about it, and attack it and him sometimes! It's so painful. Do you have any ideas of what can help?

PTSD-1343,Growing up in poverty,"Hello, I am an American (living with Australian partner) who grew up in poverty. There were times in my childhood and young adulthood where I was denied food, education, heating in the winter, and healthcare when desperately ill, injured, or mentally ill. This is the norm in America unfortunately. I feel out of place in Australia. I feel panicky about money. I rarely feel secure, and it's always temporary. I'm constantly meeting people that take their affordable college education, inherited home, Medicare, and safety nets for granted. It messes with my head and leaves me feeling isolated. On top of this I am homesick but also petrified at the thought of returning to miserable wages ($7.25 an hour), no healthcare, unaffordable college. I currently live in one of the wealthiest places in Australia (unintentionally-place my partner could find work). My anxiety and depression has increased. We worked our butts off this year to build savings but I feel like I have a form of PTSD. I'm always scared, obsessed, and anxious about money. I've seen doctors and a psychologist and I feel they don't understand where I'm coming from. You can tell people something, but if they can't imagine having to live it, they're not going to get it.

PTSD-1344,Please Help Me,"Hello, Ummm, to be truly honest I don’t know how to start this.... I guess it all started when I was 4/5, when my father met my step mother, it all went bad from there.... My mum and father went to court for custody of me, my mum won, but the stupid courts made me go to my fathers every second weekend and every half of the school holidays.... my step mother had other children, from a past relationship, and once her and my father got together she was pregnant.... I’m not going to go into full detail, with what happened, but all I’m saying is that I was mentally and physically abused by my step mother, father, step siblings and half siblings.... my poor mum had to sometimes drag me to drop offs, I would always cry, I could tell it killed her, she always had to calm me down, cause I would be in big trouble if my father caught me crying.... when I turned 16, I thought to myself, I don’t need to see my father, I’m old enough to make my own decisions.... and I’m sure we can all guess how that turned out..... Yup, not good, my father, step mother and that side of the family turned up the mental abuse to 1000%, which made me break down a few times in year 12, which I couldn’t go to any of my classes.... That’s some of my past, I’m so glad my mum met my step dad, he’s been more of a dad to me, I even changed my last name to his, for Father’s Day last year. I’ve been feeling really bad these last couple of months, but the last few weeks it’s been getting worse. I’ve been cancelling appointments so I don’t have to leave the house, but then I feel so lonely.... I know I have family and friends that are there for me, but I’ve never felt this bad, like I’m so alone and that no one really cares.... I was actually feeling okay for a while, until the guy I was seeing, started messaging me bluntly and when we made plans, he didn’t turn up or message me, I told him how I was feeling and I got nothing in response, he just shrugged it off like I didn’t matter, it made me feel like I didn’t, I just wish he at least could of apologised. I feel silly, because I’m complaining about my petty problems, and I know that people have it much worse than I do. It’s kinda funny, even when I’m so down that no one can drag me back out, I’m still helping others....

PTSD-1345,PTSD after sexual assault,"I don’t really remember much of the details anymore. I was sexually assaulted by my step father. It took me awhile to come out and tell people but when I finally had told my mother she told me I was wrong and that I was imagining things. She also told me not to tell anyone. And I didn’t for a long time. But when I thought that he was going to jail, I told my father. I was terrified. Anyway the point is that this experience has made me terrified for any kind of new relationships. I’m not really comfortable around males only my father and brothers. Because of this I cant sleep very well, I don’t do well with any forms of communication with people except family and friends that I knew before it happened.

PTSD-1346,PTSD and dissociation,"Hi I have PTSD. Mostly it’s controlled and I have developed techniques along the way thanks to my psychologist and go to help when reliving traumatic episodes. However, I find that I can talk sometimes to people about the trauma without any emotion at all. It is like I am talking about someone else and I can completely dissociate any emotion. It’s when I’m in control of the dialog and the when and where it comes up. People have often commented that I’m so calm and measured. I find it’s in complete contrast to the traumatic stress I can endure at night, or when I’m by myself. When I do have a flash back even though I know they happen at night and certain things will trigger it I’m surprised by how much fear and anxiety I experience over it and it takes days for me to recover yet during the day it’s almost (particularly at work) as if I’m a different person.

PTSD-1347,22/f child sex abuse survivor - ptsd ruining my relationship with SO kids,"I recently started counselling for the sexual abuse I endured at the hands of my father until I was 7. I am currently in the worst mental state I have ever been in. I have a partner with 2 daughters aged 4 and 6 who I love to bits but I cannot bring myself to be around them while their dad interacts with them. I have multiple panic attacks daily due to forcing myself to re-live the past after my father denied everything again recently - because I finally told his brother about what he had done. I have since blocked him out of my life (again) as I suffered a complete mental breakdown when this happened. The situation with my partner and his girls has gotten worse since then, I know that nothing is going on as I watch them like a hawk but my anxiety is through the roof as soon as it is our turn to have them. I have a panic attack when he gives them a bath, dresses them, reads them a story in bed, if they sit on his knee or he cuddles them on the couch. I physically cannot be around them together without having a meltdown anymore. I hate this whole situation - I hate that I'm making him feel weird about being a dad, I hate the thought of him putting distance between himself and his girls because of my unwarranted fears. I hate that it makes me snappy and feel sick every time he gives them a hug. We have been together for 2 years and I love him with every fibre of my being and I love his girls too, I just don't know howto shake this horrible horrible feeling that is ingrained into my bones. Dread. I didn't foresee this reaction, up until 5 months ago I was fine. Not great but ok. Now I hate myself more than ever because I'm letting him down.

PTSD-1350,"Complex Trauma - newly triggered, anxiety, sense of urgency, and fears of abandonment after 30 years....?","I have just had (as close as I can explain it) a feeling of being ""triggered"" just 2 weeks ago. I had a therapist that ""saw through me"" and brought up feelings and issues that I had long buried and suppressed, she encouraged me to explore through journal writing. Unfortunately things did not progress so well and I have been feeling like 'a cat on a hot tin roof'. I have made contact with Blue Knot (not sure if I can mention them here or not) but they helped me realise that I had been ""hyper aroused"" or similar and I needed to put all the things back into the box and just bring them out gradually and that it was much more important to feel safe.... I TOTALLY AGREE. Problem is that, on the outside, I appear to be doing okay, but on the inside I am feeling terribly anxious and needy. I have met with a great CALM clinical psychologist but when my session ends I feel okay but by the next hour/day I feel alone and unsure of what to ""do"" to deal with the feelings of unsettling in my stomach. I am trying not to ""stalk"" my psychologist with emails and she tells me ""we'll deal with them next session"". I realise now I had not set up safety strategies to protect myself (which is pretty understandable considering I had never dealt with these things before). I have this sense of urgency to kind of talk about it or help me soothe... It's like I need to talk but I can't talk to any of my friends or family because they don't understand. I have had all the feelings or abandonement, disgust, shame, hurt, anger, internalised pain, regret, insecurities, flashbacks, panic attacks, self hate, etc. and all so fast and furious... I'm really not surprised that people resort to drugs, risky behaviour and 'other' actions to stop the ""feelings"". I'm okay but I would love some tips on how to deal with this ""sense of urgency"" and ""fear of abandonement"" while inbetween weekly psychologist visits. I've tried mindfulness, deep breathing, mood apps, being aware of the senses, journal writing, earthing meditation (I've even tried to inflict pain, it's not recommended). Problem is the feelings just keep interfering and I struggle not to obsess over ""thinking""... The only real kind of thing that works is to read and research 'everything' and eventually I'm exhausted and fall asleep... Some of those psych talks are quite dry after 1 hour (smiley face). Love to hear from those who may survived something similar because I don't feel like a survivor... looking for hope.....",Idkme,Community Member,12-10-2018,PTSD and trauma,85,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/complex-trauma-newly-triggered-anxiety-sense-of-urgency-and/td-p/427504
PTSD-1351,need to end toxic relationship but I'm lost,"okay this is my first time posting anything ever but I'm not sure what else to do anymore. we have been together for almost 10 years and over that time our relationship has become toxic, verbally and emotionally abusive. now my only emotions towards OH is dislike anger and resentment. I have been medicated for depression for over a year now. having a baby together really pushed me over the edge. if we didn't have DC together I would have ended us already. I did move out for a while when DC was quite young, but after going on a family holiday together (because it was paid for) we talked about counseling and I agreed to come home. counseling didn't work out, just caused more fights so we stopped. all of this fighting happens in front of DC. since DC came along it has been a never ending battle over who is the better parent. OH is controlling in the way OH thinks we should raise DC. I am always ""wrong"" and cant do anything right by DC according to OH. we have no routine in place for DC like bed time because OH 'wont get to spend enough time' with DC. which leads to over tired tantrums at 11pm. we both work early am shifts. OH has poor ideas on diet. never cooks, wont offer fruit or healthy snacks etc and mocks me for trying to. now DC only ever wants to eat ""treat"" food. OH has pointed out that I'm a bad parent every time I made a mistake or couldn't sooth a tantrum etc. and also pushes in to take over. and I just feel like OH half wants me out of the picture permanently. OH abuses me about trying to parent DC like a time out for naughty behavior. but its fine when OH does it. I really feel that while OH deeply loves and would do anything for DC; OH is not responsible enough for 50/50 custody. OH is not good with money. takes no financial responsibility and I feel from experience will not be proactive in ensuring money is there for necessities. rent, energy bill, car payments etc. OH also has never ending fines unpaid. also has habit of leaving jobs and being on ""holiday"" for weeks. leaving financial burdan on me. hardly ever cleans or cooks. so I can not imagine DC being in a safe and comfortable environment. OH ""friends"" and ""habits""are not the type of people/things I want DC exposed to. I grew up with an emotionally absent parent so I WANT OH to be a part of DC life and I feel like a monster that I think OH should have less than half custody. we will seperate when the lease ends. it kills me that DC is the real victim here. what do I do?",lostnbroken,Community Member,29-03-2019,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/need-to-end-toxic-relationship-but-i-m-lost/td-p/406834
PTSD-1352,New here,"I myself have suffered from depression, anxiety, PTSD. Due to a great deal of reason in my life. I am retired and coping with stress an anxiety. Recently a Doctor of mine committed suicide, then I found out my daughter had turned to Alcohol to cope with pain. l live in the country and my daughters did not wish to worry me, I started picking up on the messages and twigged something was up. My eldest daughter was getting desperate and told me what was going on. I was in disbelief, then I found out how bad the drinking was getting. Last night I was on the phone with her for over an hour trying to help. I felt so exhausted last night emotionally drained, almost in tears, they lived through years of alcohol abuse from their father I never dreamed anything like this would happen. Especially as they are now grown women. I've had flash backs to my life, before, the images I never wanted to see again, trying to keep them out of my head has been hard. I usually get up early and go swimming before the day starts, I couldn't this morning.

Few years down the track it’s caught up to me and i was recently diagnosed with psychosis. During this time I’ve had a hard time with relationships.

PTSD-1355,Dealing with PTSD at night time,"Hi all, I’m relatively new here and this is my first time making my own thread! I was wondering if anyone has any tips on dealing with PTSD specifically at night time when trying to fall asleep? For some background info, I was sexually assaulted almost 2 years ago, at 18, by a stranger while travelling solo and I denied it for a long time because I felt so shameful and most of all I did not want to accept it had happened. I started dealing with it a couple months ago as I was having really bad panic attacks and nightmares which were significantly interrupting my daily life, so I started going to a psychologist again. This is on top of already having depression and anxiety which I have had for almost six years. My main difficulty recently has been dealing with PTSD at night time. Even if I have had a relatively good day without any triggers, I still seem to go to bed at night and everything comes rushing back in. I can’t help but think about all the bad memories and shameful feelings about myself and I just end up feeling so anxious and depressed that I can’t sleep. I am also hesitant to fall asleep as I worry about having nightmares about the assault. I would really appreciate if anyone has any advice to deal with this?",quokka,Community Member,26-03-2019,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/dealing-with-ptsd-at-night-time/td-p/404153
PTSD-1356,Permanently leaving an emotionally abusive relationship,"I have just left my partner of 9 months, 10th time is a charm, and this time I want it to be for good. Apologies for the long story but I’m sure this will always be very cleansing for me to open up. I met him over a year ago through tinder. He’s due to turn 40 this year, I’m 28. My therapist believes from what I’ve told her that he has borderline PD, and narcissistic too. I knew something was off about him from the start. He came on very strong, showered me with upmost attention, acted caring and attentive. He put me high up on a pedestal. He pushed a relationship after only one date even though I was adamant about taking things slow, and love bombing me within three weeks of knowing me. Massive red flag. He was deceitful, manipulative and needed constant validation, if it wasn’t from me than it was other women. He disrespected me through sexting others and sending half naked photos of himself. I never discovered him physically cheating but my gut feeling was telling me he had, which I trust especially from his other behaviour. He would go silent on me for days on end if I voiced my needs and wants not being met. It was definitely his need to gain power over me. But I also wonder what else he was doing on those silent days and if he was with other women. All the names I got called when we would argue, I.e a psycho, bore, crazy, and apparently passive aggressive. I felt so worthless, unappreciated andndevalued in the relationship. I kept idealising a fantasy of what this person could be, only focusing on the good, rather than what he really was and overlooking the bad. When our times were good and I felt loved, I was in ecstasy. I’m still addicted to the high of making up, seeing his name pop up on my phone, and the crumbs of the intimate moments we shared, and I kept going back for more of it. I always ended up missing him and wanting him hence why I took him back. I know the underlying reasons why weren’t healthy, and need to go walk away for myself and my future. I truly deserve far better. I grew up in an emotionally abusive and dysfunctional environment of my mother being an alcoholic, and witnessing intense arguments between my parents. My understanding is that I found comfort in the abuse my borderline was giving me. I’m in therapy now to overcome the codependency and learning to love myself for the first time, but wanted to gain extra support in my weak moments of unblocking him... Can anyone else relate to my experience?",Meags90,Community Member,21-07-2018,PTSD and trauma,11,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/permanently-leaving-an-emotionally-abusive-relationship/td-p/376198
PTSD-1357,Marital assault,"So my husband assulted me. I dont think he would see it that way. It’s complicated. We were both drunk and consenting when I said stop during the act because I was feeling ill, he continued while I drifted in and out of consciousness. I feel low and haven’t been able to work because I just can’t concentrate or breathe. I feel guilty because had I not started feeling unwell I would have still gone along. At the same time I feel disrespected, He had his phone out at one stage and I mumbled not to record me. He said he wasnt but I don’t know why else he had it. Essentially I have no trust left in him or myself. I don’t know where to from here because I’m just empty and alone. I don’t think he cares for me. At least not as much as I need him to. I can’t tell friends or family - it’s humiliating. I’m seeing my psychologist tomorrow but I don’t know if I will be even able to bring it up there. I havent been able to talk to him about it as I don’t know if I want to hear his response. Im feeling so lost and unable to function. I can’t keep pretending that everything is ok, that I’ve got it all under control - life, career, family. I haven’t and I know I’m spiraling.

PTSD-1358,Struggling to leave,"Hello. This is my first time making a post and I am feeling a bit anxious about it. I have been in a relationship for 4yrs and we have a beautiful 3yr old daughter together. For awhile now the relationship has been emotionally abusive. He has never been physically violent but I also know that it can become physical very quickly..If I am to be completely honest though...I think it has always been abusive. I look back now and I can see alot of red flags...I know I HAVE to leave and I really want to leave but I am finding it much harder than I thought I would. I have been seeing a councilor who has been helping with a safety plan and talking me through disconnecting emotionally. I also have a very dear friend who is very supportive. I got up today and I wanted to just leave and not look back but I was scared that if I left I would come back. I am very rearly happy anymore and my partner's behavior is affecting our daughter too. His abuse is never directed at her but I also know it doesn't have to be to affect her. I also know the longer I stay the harder it will be to leave. One of the things that makes me stay is I don't want to leave anything behind. Stupid I know because my life, my daughter's life and our mental health is worth more than anything I have in my house. I suppose I am just really struggling to except what I know I have to do, not just for myself but, also for my daughter. I feel so lost!!

PTSD-1359,I feel like I am drowning,"Hi everyone, since giving birth to my beautiful 17 month old daughter, i found that my emotions have been up and down and have gotten worse when my dad passed away suddenly from terminal cancer. It took a while for me to get back to normal and I was ok for a while until my daughter had a injury and had a minor skull fracture which was traumatic for my fiancé and I. She is fine now but i recently went to the follow up appointment and now she has to get an MRI and has to get sedated which makes me feel so upset all over again, I feel like this is all my fault. After the doctors appointment that weekend, my fiancé drank so much one night that I experienced domestic violence for the first time where I was trying to put my little one to sleep and he was in the room and I said please I'm trying to put her to sleep can you leave and he threatend me to put my daughter down so he can hurt me and was trying to grab me while I was holding our daughter. I ran outside and he locked us out of the house. This brought back memories of growing up with my father drinking alcohol and abusing my mother and us kids. I went to next door neighbours house and they called the police, the police came and arrested him and we had to go through court where he was convicted, now he has a community correction order and an Avo where he cannot drink and be around my daughter and I for 2 years. We have worked things out where he is not going to drink anymore but I cannot help but feel guilt about what happened with everything's that's happened with my daughters fall, my dad's death, not coping well with sleepless nights with daughter teething, my fiancé having an alcohol problem, the incident with the police, I have been crying all the time and my fiancé is sick of me crying. I feel like I am the problem and I am drowning like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Can someone please give me insight on what I should do, do I have undiagnosed post natal depression?

PTSD-1361,feeling too broken to love and be loved,"Hello everyone, I feel like my baggage is too heavy to carry into a relationship, but i am lonely and I don't want to feel lonely forever. I have a history of sexual trauma and domestic violence. I have anxiety PTSD and episodes of depression. I had avoided anything that remotely like a relationship for nearly 6 years until the start of last year, I was as open as I could be about my history and trauma, but i don't think i went about any of this in the ""right"" way. I feel at times I dumped it on him. I also feel at times that rather than expressing my needs I focused of trying to ""prove"" to him and reassure him that I was okay when I wasn't. Because I didn't want him to feel he was walking on glass. But my trauma would come out in other ways. And I learnt alot of things about myself that i really don't like. I am not always kind. I had feelings for this man that were greater than any feelings I had ever ever had. And I think that it somehow brought out the worst in me. I don't think he ever ever got to see my best side. I knew I was messed up. But I don't think I knew just how ""broken"" I was untill I really really liked someone. Obviously it didn't work out. And it has left me feeling guilty for having inflicted myself and my garbage onto him. I would like one day to have a healthy caring relationship one day. But I don't think I can be my best self.

PTSD-1362,"Lost, confused and indecisive.","I am a 27 year old female and have been dealing with depression and anxiety since I was 16. I have been on anti-depressants for the last four years and have been with my partner who is 37 for about a year and a half. I recently found out I am pregnant so my doctor has had me weaning off the anti-depressants. My partner and I have had some big fights in the past which has sometimes gotten physical. We recently had an argument and it ended up getting physical after he locked doors to certain rooms in the house and took my house keys so I couldn’t get back in if I left. He also took all my clothes and belongings and shoved them in one big pile on the floor of one of the spare rooms. All I’ve ever wanted was to be loved by someone and have that family kind of unit and it really broke me this time when this happened I think especially because I’m pregnant this time. I am in no way perfect and I make a lot of mistakes and I know that I can be hard to deal with due to my anxiety and need for things to be a certain way. I ended up forgiving him and went back home but now I keep thinking if this is really the life I want. He has kids already who I absolutely love and adore but it has also been a struggle for me to come to terms with this lifestyle. I have just found a money tin (which I contribute mostly to but he puts a few coins in every now and then) at the top of his wardrobe when it used to sit in the spare room. I asked him about it and got upset because I feel like it’s controlling me and taking my things away but he just sees it as me getting re-angry. I do love him and most of the time he is a great guy - looks after me when I’m sick, cooks for me etc. but I am really struggling at the moment.

PTSD-1363,Unsure if I am dating a sufferer of Borderline Personality Disorder - Any advice appreciated!,"Hi All, I have been in a relationship with someone for about a year now (He is 24 and I am 25). When we first met he was incredibly charming, loving, generous, caring and intense. I was completely infatuated with him and we rushed into things quite quickly. In the beginning everything seemed wonderful. We wanted to spend as much time as we could together (Despite this probably not being all entirely healthy in itself). However, in due time he opened up to me about his depression and past childhood traumas from family members. He has had a hard childhood. At the start I believed he simply had depression and I encouraged him to seek help and tried to be a support and provide resources for him. He was consistently swinging between agreeing he should get help and wanting to feel better, to telling me nothing would help and he would not try. As the months went on, I began to see more and more different sides to him. Uncontrollable mood swings in the same day (very high, very low, very angry, excited, bored - you name it), uncontrollable anger over small things, suicide threats, compulsive lying (where he was caught out on a number of occasions), impulsive behaviours, cheating, emotional blackmail when I would try to leave - it goes on and on. I have also quite literally talked him out of suicide on a number of occasions via text and phone for hours on end. He eventually would reach a point where he would tell me he would calm down and consider his options. He consistently reports feelings of 'numbness', not 'knowing who he is', and feeling 'completely empty'. Fast forward to where we are currently. I recently discovered he had cheated on me and initially he made many stories up to deny the reality of the situation before finally admitting the truth, saying he did it mindlessly and in an 'attempt to feel something'. I am hurting so much in this relationship. I have been put through a lot of emotional manipulation, guilt, idealisation and then devaluation in the same day, betrayal - it goes on. I really feel lost. Having done my own research on these symptoms I began to wonder if he suffers from BPD. It is something I raised with him once, asking if he would consider going to therapy or to seek help - which he completely refused. I am unsure what to do and any advice or guidance would be so greatly appreciated.

PTSD-1364,Barking Dogs,"Two years ago we were in a nightmare situation living next to 5 dogs that barked at each other practically all day while their owners were at work full-time. The dogs were left in the back yards of two properties that adjoined each other. I am a stay at home mum with young kids so was at home a lot. Eventually, after a very long and stressful process (around 9 months) of reporting to council, the situation was more or less resolved. However now, over a year later, I still seem to be unable to cope with the sound of dogs barking at all. It's like every single bark causes some kind of stress response in my body. I should say this is only if the barking is loud, like from a house near to mine, or if the dog is near me in a coffee shop etc. If it is far away barking it is more of a mild irritant that i might not even notice straight away, so not a huge deal unless it goes on and on.

PTSD-1365,Trauma Bonding,"ok i don't know where to start, ive never done anything like this before but honestly im desperate. the last few years have been absolute hell. i was sexually abused by a close male friend of mine. honestly? ive suffered techically """"worse"""" abuse. but nothing has cut as deep into my soul as the look in his eyes when he looked into my soul, saw only fear. the twisted, sick, smile on his face. he feels nothing but pleasure and anger. hes not a human. long story short ,after the initial assault i grew desperately attached to him. within a few months i couldnt live without him. hes like an addiction. i need him to make me feel okay. ive tried to cut him off so many times, and it's just left me feeling increasingly suicidal untill i reach back out for him for my own safety. the sexual abuse continued. as i said, it wasnt the worse sexual abuse ive encountered, he didnt rape me. ive had alot worse (when i was 14 someone else attempted to rape me) but nothing has stuck with me. the emotional abuse started. he somehow drove into my soul with a dagger and cut the cords connecting me to myself. i stopped going to school. i didnt really talk to anyone except him. i didnt leave the house for weeks at a time. i wasnt eating, i was up till 5am talking to him because for a period of time he refused to talk to me at any other time, probably as an abusive tactic so i obliged, doing anything to not lose him. i didnt see him for months as he refused to leave the house, i nearly killed myself over this. i couldn't deal with the pain, i started self harming. i thought if i saw him again this torment would stop, it didnt. it got worse. it all got worse. i moved schools because even though he didnt attend anymore just being around where this stuff happened was too hard. he continued to cut into my soul. and he still is. because i cannot get rid of him. hes stuck inside my soul. i cant explain the horrible feeling hes left inside me that makes me need him, rely on him. after all the trauma hes caused me, why would i want to be anywhere near him? my therapist has suggested trauma. bonding. i think shes right, but i dont have any idea how to help it. how to get rid of him. this is probably a far fetched attempt but, any help would be appreciated. i neeed to get rid of him. even any similar experiences? thankyou",rose_uwu,Community Member,20-03-2019,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trauma-bonding/td-p/397723
PTSD-1366,"PTSD, anxiety and depression - Struggling. New to BeyondBlue.","Hi all Newbie here I was raped 6 years ago. I only started seeking help about it last year, before that I completely denied it had ever happened & lived completely in denial about it, never speaking about it at all. No one was there & I didn’t know the perpetrator. As nightmares, anxiety & depression started to rise it became clear I couldn’t hide from it any longer & my life started to unravel. I couldn’t work for almost a year, could barely leave the house, couldn’t even make phone calls to make appointments for myself with my regular GP who was helping me through this challenging time. Since that unravelling its been an absolute rollercoaster full of massive highs and massive lows. Massive highs of finding the strength to begin and continue therapy, tell my family what had happened to me and make other big steps to finding my version of stability and recovery, as well as massive lows such as incredibly bad days, diagnosis of PTSD, and other major obstacles. Despite being on medication, semi-regularly continuing with my psychologist, having a super strong network of family and friends that know now of my rape & can support me I still struggle so much. I know that I am so lucky to have a great network of supportive people around me, but I’ve hit a wall & I just feel exhausted, nauseous and as if my body has been hit by a train. Every day my whole body aches, my head hurts, I have stomach problems and struggle to make it through a day without needing a nap or mass amounts of caffeine to cope. And I don’t understand why L . To add to this I’m just feeling more & more that no one really understands what I feel & how hard every single day actually is. I am grateful for every single person in my support network but they don’t understand. They don’t understand feeling so sick & exhausted basically every day for no reason. They don’t understand how hard it is to just have nightmares most nights.. Of my attack and just of distressing, disturbing things. They don’t understand my brain & the hardest part is I don’t understand it either but I am trying to.

For the past 2/3 months, he has consistently had more than 2 drinks daily with the previous 2 weekends averaging about 9 or 10 per day. He will place empty beer cans in different boxes around the house. In the past he has (without asking), drunk my wines, vodka and any other alcohol I have bought. One wine was a special 40th birthday present he decided to drink one afternoon before i got home from work. I came home to 3 qtrs of the bottle gone. Only replaced it with a chest red that i could only use for cooking. He hides bottles of wine in the shed and in a locked cupboard in the garage. At the moment, he has placed a bottle in the corner of the house behind an occasional chair. This is not new and this hiding has been ongoing for many years. He drinks mainly by himself and if we are home he will drink in the shed or garage out of site. He is extremely defensive about his consumption. I don't know if this is a physical dependence or a psychological one and I don't know how to keep living with this. His behaviour even after only 1 or 2 get really nastily sarcastic and abusive - as an example... calling all the indigenous students at the indigenous unit at my uni (including me) a bunch of zombies. ( I have gone back to uni getting a dual degree). Opinions would be most welcome. I am exhausted from coping with this.",NoHar,Community Member,08-03-2019,PTSD and trauma,12,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/feel-like-walking-away/td-p/382790
PTSD-1368,New Mum PTSD & Severe Anxiety,"Hello .. I'm new to all of this as I have never struggled with mental health before .. Last September/October changed me completely. I was diagnosed with preeclampsia at 29 weeks pregnant, before I was pregnant I had only ever had the occasional shot, I had never been in hospital. The day I was diagnosed the next 2 months was living hell .. I was flown from my rural town to Brisbane for an emergency cesarean, I'm petrified of planes and had only ever been on 1 my entire life. Then I was strapped down on a stretcher in a tiny rural flying doctors plane and flown straight to Brisbane. When I got to brisbane they decided they could control my blood pressure and controlled it till I was 35 weeks. So everyday I had multiple injections, medication 3 hourly and observation. All I wanted to do was cuddle my partner and fall asleep but I couldn't leave the hospital, I was so petrified. Then the day finally came where they told me 'bub isn't growing and has lost the fluid around her, we will be delivering her today'. This shocked me to my core .. I was booked in for 2pm, i was almost in the operating room, when I got bumped and had to wait longer, I hadn't even decided on a spinal or to go under. By the time I got into the operating room my blood pressure had sky rocketed and the surgeon said if I got a spinal there is a chance they would have to put me under half way through if my blood pressure was to climb any higher. So I went under and had a gorgeous little 2012gm baby girl. She was immediately taken to NICU, we couldn't hold her for 3 days then I was discharged and I had to leave her there .. she had to stay for a month, this damaged my soul. I'm starting to recognize my triggers .. I've only found one but that's a start the fear of having a heart attack as I suffer palpitations from the anxiety. my heart is racing just typing this and I feel physically sick.",Shan096,Community Member,20-03-2019,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/new-mum-ptsd-severe-anxiety/td-p/397997
PTSD-1369,Stuck.,"Hi my name is Claudia and this is just feeling like a shout into the void but I’m hoping something will come of it. I have been diagnosed with severe depression, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety and OCD. I had what I feel very changing and horrible experiences through my childhood. I felt there was a lot of abuse through the situations, but they call me crazy and slam me back down. I’m 15 years old and have had mental health issues majorly impacting my life for around 7-8 years now, I remember praying and begging for my life to be taken before I could even comprehend suicidality I don’t know how or if things will get better, I don’t even know if it is possible to work through these things, I don’t know if they can help me. I’ve been on around 4-5 medications, from lowest to highest doses, 13 therapists/psychiatrists and nothing has helped. It just feels hopeless sometimes. I’d like to hear about if anyone has been in similar situations. But I should wrap this up now. There’s so many people here and I’m just one. I don’t wanna take up too much. I hope everyone has an absolutely lovely day.",claudiflower,Community Member,19-03-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/stuck/td-p/396823
PTSD-1370,Anxiety used to threaten - huge vent honestly,"Hi. I’m honestly here to vent about stuff. My parents have been using my social anxiety as a reason to make me do more work and use it to threaten me. My anxiety has gotten to the point where I don’t want to call people, feel physical pain and pressure and have been ok the verge of a mass panic attack. Especially adorning a homophobic father it obviously hasn’t been easy. I’m always on the verge of tears and can cry anytime, and I’ve just began ignoring getting yelled at and physically abused. It’s not great. I’m scared for everything, and everyone’s going to suspect me of having this and annoy me and use me for it. Right now I’m just worried for everything. This has barred me from making so many new connections and I’ve lost so much I can’t even recover. I just want to go back to the old days where I wasn’t berated for a mental condition that was induced upon me in this household. I don’t want to be blamed for everything. Im sick of it and I want to be somewhere nobody can use me. Or take advantage of my good nature. Anxiety is the worst when you feel like someone’s hurting you every time you speak to the one special person you know you can’t have, or the times that your forced into social situations that make you just want to pass out or leave. That’s it for the vent. If I respond it’s only to reassure. I’ll read everything, thank you.",juneue,Community Member,17-03-2019,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/anxiety-used-to-threaten-huge-vent-honestly/td-p/393137
PTSD-1371,Guilt over miscarriage,"I had a late term miscarriage. 19 weeks and 5 days. Nothing was wrong with my baby. He was alive while I was in labour. I feel like my actions leading up to pre term labour were to blame. I was working and had a very big week. I became very ill and pushed through work. I am still ill 11 days later and they don't know what it is. whilst I had seen a doctor 4 days prior to giving birth, I didn't go back for several days, even though I knew I had become worse. I couldn't walk and was only able to crawl to shower and bathroom then back to bed. I should have called an ambulance, I should have gathered the strength to go to the hospital. I didn't and I knew I was really sick, even though my husband didn't think I was that bad. If I had maybe they would have been able to treat my illness before labour happened and my little boy wouldn't have died. I hate myself, I blame myself for his death. I have two other kids and that keeps me going but I hate myself. I feel like I died the day I gave birth to my boy and they just forgot to bury me with him. I am seeing a psychologist but they couldn't fit me in for 3 weeks. I just needed to get this off my chest without looking at my family and friends and trying to find the right answers, what they want to hear.",Guest_922,Community Member,23-09-2017,PTSD and trauma,75,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/guilt-over-miscarriage/td-p/336433

PTSD-1374,Help with parenting 4 year old who triggers me,"Hi, first time poster so go easy on me! Long story really. I was raped as a young child by my father, i have a couple of broken memories but those memories suggest theres more i dont remember, nor do i wish to remember. I am diagnosed bipolar but i think i actually have complex ptsd. When my daughter was born it was incredibly difficult. I couldnt stand her crying. I would carry on at her if she woke in the night for feeding. I felt guilty changing her nappy and putting on rash cream - like really wrong. Lately she has been doing this high pitched scream everytime she is told no or its bedtime or whatever. I cant stand it anymore. It gives me strong feelings of anger and urges though i dont act on these feelings its incredibly difficult to deal with. She does it everywhere. At home, at church, at the shops. I think the only place she doesnt is at kindy!! I also find myself dissociating a bit when shes home. I find it incredibly difficult to play and be silly. We have lots of cuddles and stories. She is a well loved child. But when it comes to playing i cant do it, i feel frustrated and it never lasts long. And lots of guilt that i dont give her enough attention. i also am a bit hypervigilant i suppose you would call it. Im always sussing people out and looking for signs someone might be a peadofile. I suppose really im just looking for advice on how to cope. She just screamed at me because i wont let her have icecream for lunch. The noise is so piercing i cant take it anymore. She is fussy with food, wastes and asks for something 5 mins later, refuses to clean up unless i basically do it for her and is downright defiant at times. This all triggers my inner rage and hopeless feeling. Has anyone successfully parented with trauma? The advice i find online is to ignore it. Ignore the screams, the tantrums, the kicking and hitting. But i CANT. Even if i dont dicipline her she still gets a response. She can see it affects me because i cant control it. So she keeps doing it. Its like her go to reaction. I can't parent in all the conventional ways as im not a conventional parent that had a decent upbringing. Any advice from anyone on how they parented with PTSD/Bipolar/anxiety dissorders or any other relevant illness is much appreciated. Any way i can teach her to respect my boundaries a bit better? I dont even know if thats reasonable to expect of a 4 (nearly 5) year old?

PTSD-1375,Another newbie here - How do I support a sexual abuse survivor and myself?,"Hi everyone. I'll be known as Brad on here but that's not my real name. I'm 55 and married to a wonderful woman who is a little older than myself. She is a survivor of a horrible sexual assault that occurred in her late teens. Since she confided in me about her assault we are both struggling with the ongoing consequences of what happened to her, and due to the deeply personal nature of the situation I have no one I can talk to or share my feelings with. To tell a friend or family member would be betraying the trust my wife has placed in me when she shared her story. So I'm hoping someone on here may be able to help point us in the right direction, because right now I'm hopelessly lost on how to deal with all of the emotions and thoughts that are going on, and we are seriously drifting apart as a couple.

PTSD-1376,"I’m new, Hi! How do you keep enduring  (dealing with childhood sexual abuse)","Hi All, I unexpectedly had the sexual abuse I experienced as a child (7 - 12 years old) come back and “haunt” me with a terrible vengeance late last year. I had a bit of a breakdown really after a very challenging year my husband nearly died, a childhood friend murdered, multiple family medical challenges etc. The last last straw was me accidentally walking in front of a car and a long painful recovery. memories of my childhood sexual abuse hit me, became intrusive and I couldn’t deal with life very well any more. I reached out to my GP and have been seeing a psychologist since and am transitioning back to work again in a painfully slow process. I’m finding the process so unbelievably hard. So much shame, self-hatred and feelings that I should be doing better (given a whole lot of people experience worse). I also struggle with feelings that I am wasting the medical professionals time and should be able to get over this better and faster. I now have days where every moment is a struggle to endure. My GP has now suggested medication in addition to the psychological treatment - but I’m really afraid of the side effects and feel I should do better. I like my GP and psychologist and have a very supportive husband. Also good friends but I don’t want to lean on them as I don’t want to bring them down with me or frighten them off - I also don’t feel like I can talk about it easily as it might get back to my abuser and it feels unfair to his privacy. The problem is I have frightened myself recently with my thoughts that I really cannot take another minute of this mental pain. I don’t want my kids to see me in a bad way or to have to get by without me. My primary abuser was my 8 year older brother who was a teen at the time. He’s still in my life and I’m not able to let him know I’m dealing with this now but I can’t avoid him easily without bringing it up with him. Another family friend of similar age to him also (independently) abused me around the age of 8 or 9. I have had “new” memories resurface as part of this process that I hadn’t remembered the only other time this hit me (over 20 years ago when I was 18 or so). I don’t even know which of them was involved in the new memory. Up to now when memories appeared I shoved them away so quickly and I led a “normal” life. Any advice on how you’ve got through a similar spot in your journey would be so much appreciated- and how you made your decision as to medication or not as part of moving forward. Many thanks...",IreneJoy,Community Member,19-02-2019,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-m-new-hi-how-do-you-keep-enduring-dealing-with-childhood/td-p/360110
PTSD-1377,"G'day! I'm dealing with some childhood trauma, and don't know what to do next.","G'day, I'm currently trying to dismantle some childhood trauma. The depression from this if left unchecked, leaves me unwilling to get out of bed or eat. I finally addressed the fact that in my first year of primary school, I was sexually assaulted repeatedly for several months by the kids in grade six when I'd go to the bathroom. There were five of them, and they ended up getting expelled for their little ""game"". Instead of therapy, my mum just taught me to be afraid of strangers, that attraction was sinful and shameful, and that women all want to take everything you have and leave. These days she also says the world is flat, and Mars doesn’t exist because NASA made it up. I love her, but she's left me with a bit of trouble to deal with. Over the past few years, I've built this helpful routine. Partly on what I found on the beyond blue website actually: 1. Daily gym 2. LOTS of home cooking 3. Talk to friends and family, and asking for help 4. Projects I can discuss and be proud of 5. Having lots of guests over, to stay social 6. Journal a few times a week After reading a book on cognitive behavioural therapy last year, I decided to acclimatise myself the intimate side of life. It's working, and I'm more confident and fluent in conversations. My painful awkwardness is vanishing, and I can make flirty jokes and use public restrooms without feeling afraid. But as my work is simple labour, my mind wanders, and I switch from happy hope, to blind rage to disdain and loathing and back to pride and gratitude for those I am close to. Work is a sort of blast furnace of self-reflection and my performance is suffering to the point where I am at risk of being let go. My family and friends have been mentioning I'm not myself too. I've been tampering with substance abuse, as I'm desperate to overcome this. Losing 25kg however, really helped me stop hating myself.

PTSD-1379,Bad memories coming back 50 years later,"I don't know what to do. I was sexually abused by a trusted neighbour when I was about 9 years old. I blocked it out of my mind. I told no-one. I was brought up in a strict catholic family and would not have dared tell my mother or father. I felt it must have been my fault. I became socially withdrawn. My parents were so strict I might have had one date in high school. I married young. My first child died of SIDS. I tried to keep my marriage going, having another three children. We separated twice. When I was 36 weeks pregnant with my last child he told me he was leaving when the baby was born. I knew he was seeing someone but, like always, I kept it to myself. We divorced. I had a very difficult middle child who went to live with his father's new family when he was eight years old.He returned when he was 17. I have had major health problems including two malignant cancers and severe asthma. I was diagnosed with the chronic pain of fibromyalgia about 8 years ago. However I made it to the top of my chosen profession until I had to resign due to illness. I set about getting my health back and have gone from strong pain killers to now being pain free. I've lost over 30 kg. I'm working full-time again. However, with all the media attention on sexual abuse it has brought back these unpleasant memories from my childhood. I find myself thinking about it most nights now and the impact I think it has had on my life. I disclosed part of the abuse once to my mother about five years ago and all she said was 'your father would have killed him.' Nothing else. I've always been a survivor but these thoughts are making me very sad. I find myself crying, and I'm not one to cry. I live alone (apart from my beautiful animals).

I was employed by a fast food restaurant had been working there for just over 3 years I was really happy there then one night on night shift we got robbed by an armed gang.. no one was hurt physically but mentally it’s taken it’s toll... I had counseling and returned to work 4 days after the incident had happened (too soon I know) all of the crew that were on that night but 3 left...I only stayed because at the time I was a mum of 2 and I say was because now I’m a mum of 3.. I have children to support I had to be working I didn’t have a choice I tried returning the 4th day and i was uncontrollably shaking and was beginning to have a panic attack so got my shift covered and this kept happening before, during and after a shift. I haven’t felt safe since the whole ordeal I check doors and windows literally multiple times before I got to bed and if I feel like I’ve missed one I’ll do it all over again..I look my car doors before I go anywhere I can’t help it.

PTSD-1384,Workplace Bullying & PTSD,"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD due to workplace bullying. Over the last 20 years, I have experienced a LOT to the point where I have had one minor nervous breakdown, borderline having a second and now living with anxiety due to my current manager & an account manager. I know many will say 'get another job' but that isn't so easy when you're almost 50, have no formal qualifications & I can't sell myself as I no longer have any kind of faith in me. Every morning I sit in my car talking myself into just backing out the drive, then when get there, I have to talk myself out of the car. I know that I am getting to the stage where I need to go as my anxiety is now affecting me on the weekend. Just the thought of going to work makes my stomach churn and the nausea starts. My sleep is shattered most nights with work related dreams. I am already seeing a psychologist through work EAP but that is going to run out shortly & there is no end in sight. I am in a thankless job, spoken to like I am no more than dirt, paid poorly & I do the most work (work admits that there is too much for one person but will no do anything about it). Yes, I am looking for another job but it is going to take time. Yes, I have approached upper management about this & I have no idea what they are doing but it seems like nothing. I am doubting my abilities to the point where I am double and triple checking my work & even more. I make a mistake I will know about it & I will be berated from both the manager and account manager as to how any why I made the mistake, how disappointed they are in me, how peed off the client is, how much money it will cost us/the client etc etc. i am not the only person the manger does this to, but I have the manger and her lap dog at my heels every day. The woman who was in this role before me left after 3 weeks, I have manged to barely survive 10 months. I cry almost every day because I feel like I cannot do anything right. I feel stupid and useless & I am right back emotionally where I was when I was unemployed. I have little enjoyment anymore and the only thing that makes me smile is my little black furry terror of a dog. I want to stop crying but I feel like I am being beaten back down every day.

PTSD-1386,Escaped from past trauma into new trauma...,"I was kicked out in October, by a mother who's abused me for years. It was mostly psychological abuse with physical only being used as a last resort or a scare tactic when the psychological threats weren't enough. I was hit, cut, battered and bruised, screamed at, isolated, controlled and faced frequent verbal abuse. I have been told that I was a ""waste of space"", ""burden"" and much more. My mother works a high-paying government job but frequently complained about me taking a financial toll. I lived in a rotting, decaying house while my mother lived it up in hotel rooms across the country, returning once a fortnight. My father has been out of the picture for many years and is an ice addict, and I once experienced trauma at the hands of his ex-girlfriend, who would lock me in a room for days at a time and force me to eat out of the rubbish. Naturally, I have some pretty big mental health issues associated with this. I'm currently living with the old family-friends I had previously been barred from seeing. However, this living situation is proving itself to be just as inadequate. One of the people I'm living with has chronic pain and thus is extremely temperamental. I am frequently being screamed at about things that have nothing to do with me, or things that are my fault but caused by trauma, and have unfortunately taken on the role of being the household's scapegoat. As someone with C-PTSD, and extremely sensitive fight/flight/freeze responses, this has been pushing me over the edge. My hyper-vigilance is through the roof as I live in the lounge room on a sofa bed. Every sound sends my heart racing and I still flinch when I hear doors open and close. I'm alternating between feeling the need to run away and the need to scream. My sleep is still shitty- it's about three hours of nightmare-plagued hell. How can I tell my body that it's safe, and that it can calm down, when it's not safe? Not entirely, anyway? I don't know what to do, or where to go.

I left him, got counselling, got myself together again and in 2016 met a man now married dec 2017 who I thought had his own life. I knew he struggled a little with stress but didn't know what i was getting into until it was too late. 5x he has told me I don't want to be with you and he went missing for days does meth & cheats on me with porn (as I have had trauma from pornography he and I agreed this was cheating from day 1) his past relationships he cheated on them with other women & prostitutes when he was high. he maintains throughout our 2.5 year relationship (1.4yrs of that we have been married) that he's never physically cheated in me. I am not too sure of it, hes adamant about it. currently he just got told, he may have autism & is being tested for it & ADHD. his whole life was a struggle with inibilties. I do love him but I cannot get past how betrayed I feel after he went missing for days to do drugs and porn God knows what else as I will obviously never know.He's promised multiple times he will never do it again but when he can't handle things that is is escapism. We have seen a psychiatrist and my husband is keen on eradicating his 20 year old drug addiction but it's been there so long I don't know how he can do it especially if he has inibilties to begin with. He is a good man off the drugs but does have sociopathic and narcissistic traits and his behaviour when he's high is disgusting. My child is never around when this happens nor does anyone else know about it his family never helped. they knew.I do love him but I have doubts about trusting him&1 day a normal life without drugs.hes always been employed & u wouldn't know he is an addict, he hides well. I many times before I've helped him, he takes advantage, does drugs , comes back apoligises then we are back there again in 3-4 months. My child is not in danger nor am. how do i trust him as he was a serial cheater. I need to feel me again I feel i filled his cup up too many times and now I am empty.

PTSD-1388,4 year old grandaughter recently traumatised by fire. Advice wanted to help her family support her.,My Son lives overseas with his family. A few days ago he found his daughter in the kitchen with a burning tea towel on the floor & his daughter screaming too petrified to move. He put the fire out & tried to comfort his daughter. She was so badly traumatised she can't talk about what happened so noone knows what caused the fire. She was convinced the house would burn down so couldn't sleep in her own bed but had to remain with her parents. Hearing this triggered very bad memories for me with a similar incident when a spark from an open fire place set fire to a favourite piece of clothing. I was about 4 at the time & had to throw the burning item into the fire to avoid setting the house on fire. I was left with an intense fear of fire which escalated when I was caught in a bushfire which destroyed our home. Remembering the fear of fire I had as a child from that first event makes me want to help my son help his daughter deal better than I did with the trauma to avoid the long term consequences.

They are ""over"" working with people who have mental conditions and their ""tough love"" approach and the way they talk about me, rather than to me really makes me angry like they think their big words are too hard for idiots to understand. They are mostly angry and constantly serious and if you try to insert humor to lighten the mood they look at me like I am from another planet. I don't like the view they have of themselves and they think they are so much better than everyone else. I feel totally hopeless and the feeling of doom never goes away.

PTSD-1391,Possible PTSD? Nightmare help,"Hi everyone, I am new on here. Unfortunately I have been struggling with a recent traumatic event and I am seeking some coping strategies. On Christmas Eve my stepmother committed suicide at our family home and she was found Christmas morning (I am an adult and do not live at the home but grew up here and was present on Christmas morning). My father, brother and I have been spending time together and I have found this to be helpful. The death was very sudden and unexpected and I would not have expected her to take this action. It has now been almost two months since her death and I am finding it incredibly difficult to sleep. I would say I think about the event and have visual images of it at least every hour of the day. At night I find it difficult to stop thinking about it while I am trying to sleep, even when I try and imagine other things. I usually have a normal wake/sleep routine but am struggling to fall asleep. Often I am close to sleep but then get a shock of anxiety, sort of like a feeling like I am falling and my stomach drops. This happens over and over and often it takes me several hours before I sleep. I try to get up and sit in a dark room for a while so I am not just lying in bed restless. When I do sleep, I have vivid nightmares of people breaking into my apartment and committing suicide in front of me and I cannot stop them and I wake sweating and panicked. I am feeling a lot of anxiety during the day. When I was younger I suffered from depression and engaged in some self-harm behaviors. I do not drink alcohol regularly or take any drugs. My regular doctor is on holidays at the moment and I intend on making an appointment when he returns. Has anyone got any any advice on how to assist with the sleeping, as well as reducing the nightmares and anxiety?

PTSD-1392,Narcissistic Abuse - Finally Free!,"I can't believe I am free. I was with my ex-fiance for 8 years and suffered at the hands of his cruel torments, naming, shaming and blaming. I forgot who I was for a long time. It wasn't until I was humiliated in public so harshly that I decided enough was enough. As a child, growing up I came from a broken home. I was lucky to have my Dad and Stepmum who loved and supported me. My mother was cruel, manipulative and destructive... but she sucked me in. It was during my early twenties and living with my mother that I realised I needed out and it was then that I met my ex-fiance. He was charming, nice, complimented me and made me feel special. This was the first alarming sign I should have seen.. but I was so wrapped up in the honeymoon period I didn't listen to my ""gut"". Once we moved in together, the abuse began. He would tell me that my family never loved me, that he was the only one who could look after me, nurture me etc. He told me I was dumb, stupid, worthless and nothing without him. He controlled what I wore, who I saw, where I went. I started losing my self confidence and my ability to converse with others. I was terrified to talk to other people or accept invitations because he would harass me, text me all night or ask people to ""look out for me"". I felt like I was constantly watched. 3 years later I left him... but I wasn't strong enough. I cried for weeks and felt more alone than ever. I took him back and endured another 5 years of hell. This time round, he didn't control who I talked to or saw.. but he diminished my existence and self worth. He used violence and blackmail to get what he wanted. He threatened to hurt my family, friends and co-workers. Work was my only sanctuary. After getting engaged, I realised I couldn't marry him. The proposal wasn't romantic at all, it felt as though it was an effort on his behalf to make me stay. He stopped listening to me and dictated every part of my life. The public humiliation was the last straw.. so I left for work... returned home after he had left and grabbed the clothes on my back. I drove for 2 days and back in the care of my family.. I am free! I have inner peace and after extensive research on narcissistic abuse I realise how much of a fool I was... how he sucked me in. My aim on here is to talk to others about it. The more we talk about it.. the less control the abuser has.

PTSD-1395,Partner doesn't get it,"Hi. I have an issue in that whenever I try to talk to my partner about the abuse and trauma of my childhood, he just doesn't seem to understand the lasting effects of trauma on a young brain. I had lots of trauma as a kid and the one lasting effect of it is that I have nightmares. He says things like ""You just gotta get over it and move on and let that stuff go. It's all in the past."" And I get that he's trying to be helpful, but it feels like he's being dismissive. I am, as much as one can be, quite 'accepting' of my nightmares. I'm used to it now and don't even really freak out about them anymore. But he seems to think it's a sign that I'm ""hanging onto"" the trauma. Which I'm not. By sharing with him about my dreams and nightmares, I'm simply bringing it out into the light and dissolving its power over me. Sometimes I just need to verbalise stuff. Anyway, I don't know if that all makes sense, or if anyone can relate ...... But if you have any words of wisdom in regard to getting him to understand the difference between 'letting go' and having 'side effects' that would be great.

I have PTSD from some bad things that happened 15 years ago ,where in the moment when dating, things started to go further than I morally intended to and i said NO and grabbed his arm to stop but he kept going and pressured me to take things further and he pushed the boundaries of how far i wanted to go. I hadn't planned on things going that far. This happened more than once. How do you stop remembering the bad incidents? I saw a psychologist. Then a few years later i had to see another psychologist again. The first psychologist said ""that boy was less than honourable"". The second psychologist a few years later said ""there's trauma attached to it."" and told me I had PTSD. For a while, keeping busy by doing hobbies, being mindful in the present and trying to think about happy memories instead helped me. But even 15 years later, the bad memories still keep popping up in my head when I don't want them to.

PTSD-1399,"Found out my ex is escorting, what to do","Hi Complicated situation. A bit of background. I was with my ex for 8 years, we have a 5 yo child. Towards the end, i was subject to immense amounts of emotional and verbal abuse. it culminated in a ohysical assault on me. She has bi polar, clinical anxiety, tourettes (just ticks) and is on about 6 anti depressents, antipsychotics and benzos. I have been supportive and kind since the breakup, but feel a bit like a doormat. Tried to reconnect a few times, didnt work out. But she clearly needs me for emotional support, as she has no one else. My issue is that i care for her, but i now know something that makes that almost impossible. She left her ipad at my house last week; i had a look at the history. What i found shocked me. It was clear she was using our daughter to manipulate me - often threatening to deny access for no reasons, joking with her only friend about it. It hurt to find out I had been used, she would often tell me she was low and needed my help and i provided it, because i care. What was worse was finding out she had been escorting. She had been selling her body on a website - and i have the screenshots of the conversations with her clients. To say i was devastated is an understatement; not for myself, but for the potential risk to our daughter. With her serious mental health issues combined with some pretty bad choices, i am not sure what to do with the information. She knows i know, i rang her as soon as i saw it. My question is, do I let her family know so they can intervene? Do i use the info to go for sole custody of my daughter? My fear is that if i let others know she might contemplate self harm from the shame. On the other hand, i be a gentleman and keep it to myself, i feel like i am watching a slow motion train wreck.

I am a current full-time paramedic, and have also worked full-time as a career firefighter internationally and interstate. I have also taught for an Interstate Ambulance service and volunteered for numerous emergency services. In my day, I had to lie about getting these jobs as the stigma is and was tremendous and I would not of got these jobs if I advised them I had a mental illness. But come today, and my work knows and is nothing but supportive as the workplace has come a long way. In short, at 19, I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia and have battled since with depression, PTSD, anxiety and to some degree bipolar. I am now in my early 40's with a family. Healthy family. I have been institutionalized 8 times but got up and back on the horse every time. It has been hard, so hard but its a battle and even today i still struggle but with a very good psychologist, the right attitude and obedience with medications I have done it all. People don't realise that hospital is a massive trauma in peoples lives and should not be overseen but in relevance to that it can be the best thing. Some of the stories I could tell are pretty funny but inspirational. Mental health should not be a block in anyone's life in regards to family, work and friends. Not saying its easy but well worth it. I have also had the privilege of traveling all around the world and I always believed you are either the victim or survivor. a great man once told me, you control your illness, not your illness control you.

You know, like I tell myself that all that trauma is in the past and I'm really not affected by it at all ..... and then February comes and the nightmares begin again. It happens every year. It's like I fail to recognize or accept that this nightmare effect thing is almost like a permanent side effect that I'll never be rid of. And my nightmares are always so incredibly vivid and in full colour. Sometimes I'll wake up immediately after it, and if it's dark in reality, and dark in the nightmare, then I don't know whether it's real or not. For a few seconds I can't tell reality from the nightmare and my heart feels like it's going to jump right out my chest. Anyway, only 24 days to go of February. I'll be okay.

I was in an abusive relationship for 3 and a half years. this relationship caused my ptsd (it was a physically abusive relationship ) in 2018 I met my second partner and so far everything is great and healthy, but 3 months in I started to feel panicky and depressed and paranoid. I worry he will hurt me and leave. I am constantly anxious. I’m not sure why I am feeling like this again. my bad dreams are back again too. why is this happening? a part of me feels like it’s because I have so much undealt with trauma. it started in childhood. I was molested a few times by different people. there is one event in particular that was really bad but i can’t remember all of it. it’s like something is missing. then when I was 12 I had anorexia, which I never had therapy for. the logical side of me is thinking it has to be all of this unresolved trauma? and i feel so angry all of the time. I barely have any friends. my boyfriend is supportive, but I need friends too. but i’m also scared to make new friends incase they hurt me as well. i’ve lost many friends over the years. I feel disconnected and scared. I want to get help but I am terrified to face what i’ve been through. I’m really really terrified. I don’t know what to do. to make things worse, my family lives far away. I miss them so much but I don’t want to move back where they are because i’d be away from my partner.

PTSD-1411,Advice needed in regards to disclosing information about my ex husband.,"Trigger Warning In March my daughter disclosed sexual abuse from my husband and his 2 sons over a 6 year period.At this stage it is still under a lengthy investigation but after extensive counselling whilst in denial in the beginning there is now no doubt in my mind what so ever and counselling has also been a massive self discovery journey to the domestic violence I accepted from a very narcissistic,manipulative man and the impact this had on my children and I bravely admit to my parenting incorrectly.The advice I need tonight which someone may or may not be able to advise me but any assistance will help is my husband and one of his sons who stayed in our home of 2 years who have never made friends or socialized and have always kept to them selves have made friends with some of the neighbors who have 2 young children and they have started having BBQ and meals there plus he ""accidentally""sent me a message tonight saying I hope the kids liked the presents I bought them! I almost vomited & felt that these kids are not safe.My physiologist has said until they are charged its not my job to save the world but I strongly feel i need to let them know to protect their children!I have lived an absolute nightmare with my daughter and son these past 9 months as everything unfolds and we try to process everything that my daughter has endured ,the self harm and suicidal thought she now endures my sons misplaced feeling of him not protecting his little sister and my guilt that I failed as a mother for bringing in a father and 2 boys to our lives that decided and broke our trust and my inability to protect my children or notice what what these monsters were doing right under my nose. I now have two very fragile children who will become warriors and i will not let this determine our future hence why the psychologist has said just concentrate on us BUT I have enough guilt hanging around ATM for something that was not in my control and I had NO KNOWLEDGE off HOW could I cope and live with myself if something happened to these innocent 7 and 9 year old children?? I understand what the psychologist is saying I dont want to get involved BUT i feel 100 % obligated to drop an anonymous letter in the mail box telling them to protect their children and making them aware there is an investigation under way..

PTSD-1413,History repeats...?,"I’m currently on my second stay in a private mental health hospital. First stint started in October, spent most of December at home and was re-admitted New Year’s Eve. I’ve had my 13th ECT today and feel like I’m getting better but there’s a pretty big obstacle that is interfering with my progress. my mother, as much as I love and appreciate her I have no idea how to let her no that her actions and talk is really making it hard to get better. And I’m worried for my daughters mental health. My partner works away, so the kids are staying with my parents while I’m in hospital. My mum favours my son, he can do no wrong (13yrs). Whereas my daughter (11yrs) gets in trouble for anything and everything. Even the looks she receives from my mum breaks my heart. It was similar growing up between myself and my older brother. i have tried all different ways of addressing this issue, 11 years of it. One time after she was really nasty to my daughter I got very upset and I exploded. My mum told me she might as well kill her self.... I can’t deal with that. i don’t no what I’m supposed to do to make her see that she’s being absolutely horrible, and unfortunately I’ve seen physical marks on my daughter too. My mum was abused by her father.... but that gives her zero right to do this to my little girl. My partner wants to say something, but if he does it’ll probably be the last time they talk. He won’t sugar coat it. My dad protected me growing up, and he does the same for my daughter, but my mum rarely does it around him. shes my mum, I shouldn’t have to protect my daughter from her. I don’t no what to do, is there a way I can get her to see what she’s doing? I’ve gone weeks/ months not talking to her before. Nothing changes. My priority is my children.

PTSD-1415,Trouble accepting complex trauma diagnosis,This is my post time posting and I’m kind of anxious about it. I’m wondering as anyone else struggled accepting they have complex PTSD. I got diagnosed a while ago now but I still can’t believe I have it. It doesn’t feel like what happened to me was all that bad. It just seemed normal family stuff but the psychologist has said it wasn’t normal. I feel like a fake and I’ve been hiding all my mental from my family no one but my husband knows. Which adds to my thoughts of this can’t be real if I’ve managed to hide it. I also get dissociation and I keep trying to find other reasons for it but the psych says it’s from trauma. I don’t know how to get past all this uncertainty.

PTSD-1417,Found out my partner of three years lived a double life,"I met my partner at my last work. We got together just a little under a year after leaving the company and on October 1st 2018 we celebrated our 3rd year anniversary, he started to move things into my place and apart from family issues in Melbourne, things were on track. I kept being told that I was loved, we had a future together and that 2019 will be 'our year'. It was all lies. During the entire 3 years of our relationship, he was with another woman. I found out about her in January 2018, due to suspicious messages and was told she was a 'psycho stalker friend that was in love with him and he didn't have the same feelings. Like a good person i believed him, he constantly told me how much he loved me. The rest of the year was spent, begging to see him, he constantly changing dates and times that we could see each other and changing every move in date we had. People i know live all far away, so when he canceled seeing me i couldnt make other plans, so I spent 2018 very isolated and depressed. He saw me for a half day 20th december and moved in some items, telling me our future will be wonderful. He told me he had to fly back to Melbourne for christmas (family issues) and would move in completely the 27th december. In a state of loneliness a day or so after christmas, i looked the other woman up again. To my complete disbelief, I found out that he married her the date I came back from the US, which was over a month ago, the 25th November 2018 from facebook photos she had posted. Heartbroken and in a state of shock, I contacted him to hear that he is indeed married and with the same woman I had fears of in January 2018. The last 3 years of my life have been a complete lie and has caused me significant emotional and financial pain. She made him call me in the afternoon on speaker to apologise, as she listened in. Even though she heard what I said she seemed almost indifferent and agitated that i'd be upset for this disgraceful act. At one point even laughing at the money spent on his birthday and christmas presents which included a new iphone, fitbit, etc... Isn't that theft by deception! The police didnt think so. I feel used, betrayed, worthless, alone and lied to soo very pathologically, that neither he nor his wife understands the gravity or situation in which I was extremely unfairly placed. I feel like an idiot and can't understand how anyone could be so manipulating. Me met everyone in my family and friends.

PTSD-1418,What is a good step to helping an angry family?,"Hey all, So yesterday my dad hurt me. I was of course, a little concerned after. According to several different sites, it is a sign of increasing violence. By the way, this is the first time this has happened. I have a great relationship with my dad, I would say that I am closer to him than my mum. And we were literally joking and laughing in the car on the way home that day. But when he gets angry its like he goes back to his instincts. Also the last time he even hurt me was 2 years ago, and afterwards he promised he would never use violence on me again. And he didn't until yesterday. So yeah you can see my confusion here, because he's pretty chill 9 times out of 10, he just has this anger problem that pops up every few months over this or that, and then my family is worried, and then forgets it happened. And then the cycle continues. I want to get him some help and see a counsellor or anger management person or something. I'd say my family also has these anger issues. I'm painting this bad picture here but my family is really friendly a lot of the time. It's only once every few months, where someone has a small argument over something dumb, that it escalates, and escalates, and escalates. None of us deal with anger well at all. My dad is the worst by far though and he's really not leading a good example. What would you say is a good step to helping an angry family? Do you know any good programs for dealing with anger management? Also, should I see a doctor ? Even if you don't answer these questions I would really appreciate a second opinion.

PTSD-1421,I am a little lost,"For 30 years I was with the man I thought I would grow old with. Sometimes it was easy and sometimes it was hard. I didn't mind so much that he kind of cut me off from friends and family - after all it was my decision I thought. I chose him to spend my lie with warts and all and that was consequence. When you are 20 it doesn't really seem much of a price to pay. I gave my all to this man. A few years ago he was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and things got steadily worse. I won't go into detail but the last few years were extremely psychologically and mentally abusive which ended in a traumatic incident, ""breaking"" me and throwing several things in the car to literally run way from home. It's a year on and I feel like I should be over it. but I am not. I don't react to things the way I used too. My concentration and memory is shot. I have trouble sleeping at the best of times and night sweats and bad dreams on some nights. Things AI used to take in my stride floor me and the thing that worries me the most is that I barely remember my life with him. That sounds good I guess, I'm not dwelling on what happened to me, but it is like my life with him - 30 years of it - is like a distant dream of a movie I once saw but didn't participate in. It scares me. I am not the person I was before and I am not really sure of who I am now. I feel like sometimes I am waiting for life to start again, and sometimes I think it has but then something happens and I find myself on my arse again wondering what the hell I am doing. I am struggling at work, take a few days off when I can't cope. People say ""you just have to get on with it"". But how? My work has counselling available but they have said I may need to find a specialist that deals with trauma and has the right programs to help deal with these things.

PTSD-1422,PTSD and functioning in society,"Hi, let me start this off by introducing myself. My name’s Emily and I have PTSD. I was diagnosed as a teenager after surviving sexual assault. I’m now a young adult and I feel like I’m only getting worse as time goes on. I’m on ssris and I have a job and a cat, little things that make me feel vaguely normal. But I’m not normal, I can’t be normal and I’ve never been more aware of it. I’m wasting my life stuck in an unbearable cycle because of something someone did to me 7 years ago. I hate myself for not being strong enough to overcome the adversity I’ve faced in my life, I know there are people who have been through so much more than me and have come out the other side so much stronger. Maybe im just weak. My anxiety is off the charts, to the point where I often can’t even go to work or leave the house. I’m staring down the road of a whole life of this. My psychiatrist told me that I just need to focus on survival. But what kind of life is that? I want to actually live and enjoy life, but I can’t. I feel like a fraud and a waste of oxygen. I’ve put my family theough hell, my mom spent all her money on the best therapists for me, and now her retirement fund is gone and she has to work every day despite her own chronic illness. And still I’m not any better. I don’t know what to do. I feel helpless and pathetic at the same time. I was never able to finish university because of panic attacks and general anxiety, I’m now trying to complete my degree online but sometimes I can’t even deal with my virtual classes.

PTSD-1423,Worried about the happiness of my children,"During my last pregnancy I had to deal with a series of traumatic events and had a really awful time being run down and sick. There have been times where I lost control and asked for help from my husband to deal with everything that was going on. I am not proud of my own behaviour at times. I have cried in front of my kids, sworn at my husband. One time I threatened to kill myself in front of my son. I am so ashamed of my behaviour. I know I need help. My husband can be aggressive towards myself and my oldest son and I’m worried about my son being raised in a household where he is unable to thrive. I’ve been handled roughly and bruised while pregnant. I can’t keep going on like this. My husband stays up until all hours playing PlayStation, he goes out whenever he feels like it, and I no longer feel comfortable with his lifestyle with two young kids at home. I have found an empty sachet with traces of drugs while cleaning the house. Stuff like that makes me worry about my eldest son finding and ingesting something. My husband is still a good dad. He is more present than his dad ever was. But I feel like since becoming a parent I’ve changed so much but he continues to act like someone without the responsibility of kids. I cant really rely on him to help me with raising my two children, the majority of work gets outsourced to my parents and my mother in law. I want him to leave. The problem is, he won’t leave even though the house was mine before we got together and it’s my family home. I’m at the point now where I’m almost certain there is nothing he can do to make me change my mind. Tonight my four year old wanted someone to sleep with because he was all alone in his room. It breaks my heart when my husband turns him away and makes him go to his room in tears alone. When I confronted my husband, he started acting all aggressive throwing things and then when I tried to sleep in bed with my son, he got into the bed so that I couldn’t lay down with our newborn forcing me to sit upright and not sleep. I’m just upset my son witnessed his parents’ toxic behaviour yet again. This kind of thing happens at least once a month lately. I just don’t know where to turn to next. Or what to do.

I need advice , I apologise in advance to anyone if my story and circumstances are not as bad as yours I just want help, insight and understanding. 7 days ago in short summary the person living in the apartment next door was found dead. I did think what if that man is dead and i was denial hoping that maybe he was with hes family for christmas or fine. I had heard and seen things I wish I hadn't when the forensics team arrived. He was a drug addict, i saw this coming as a he was lonely old man who would tolerate listening to for 30mins avg each time he saw me because he was talented at gossping about other neighbors and hard to understand from been high. Given he was dead for about 2weeks at most from what police think might of happened. That neighbor later said he was let down I didnt go in with them. Could this be true? Only thing i saw was a strecher the one time i looked out my door. I have plans in place to get help, im going through panic attacks since coming back to my home and pain which seems to have improved from the images in my mind. I want this to go away as fast as possible and dont want it to interfere with my life though I feel with time I will move on from it there is fear I might not. To say i suffer from ptsd makes me feel like its wrong because of others in worse situations then mine. I dont wanna believe it despite proffessionals suggesting it could be so. A few questions I have is whether this really is a form of ptsd and what are my chances of having it not effect me in the future?

Dr. Google isn't really helping me and I don't go back to see any of my support people until after Christmas. Can anyone shed some light on having AjD?

PTSD-1427,Marriage impacted by my sexual abuse/complex PTSD/Sexuality confusion,"Hi all, I have been in the same relationship for almost 16 years (married for 8), I have 2 beautiful kids - which are my true joy. However my life is slowly fracturing. I know that it is my own lived experience more than anything else that is to blame. I was raised in a physical/emotionally abusive house - I am the youngest of 4 sons; and by the time I as 6 I was also being sexually abused by an older brother, this abuse continued until I was 14. It became a 'normal' part of life. As a result of this childhood I have cPTSD, and almost all aspects of life give me anxiety - I have become very good at appearing 'happy', when actually under the facade I am broken. I have no birth family now, I have completely escaped - for my own health. My only family now is my wife's family. They know my childhood story, and are somewhat understanding. I have an amazing Dr Psychologist who has helped me a lot. But there are some things that are just not getting easier. My sexuality is confused. I think I am bisexual -but am disgusted in myself, and also fascinated with the idea- unfortunately these thoughts often take me back to my sexual abuse. I am trying to accept that this is me, but I will never know if I am bi because of my abuse that began when I was so young, or if I am this way 'naturally'. Acceptance of myself is the only way I can move on from this. Unfortunately my wife is conservative and when I told her about my Bi thoughts about 8 months ago, she didn't talk to me for several days, and then it took at least a month of pain for us to get back to some kind of normal relationship. My wife can't accept who I am - I did tell her in our first week together when we were young, that I had 'experimented' with a male housemate a couple of years prior (my only MM experience), she was okay with that. I have been monogamous for our entire marriage. But I now find that I need to know (definitively) my sexuality - of course I risk my own life (and impact my wife and kids lives) if it all goes wrong. I want to tell my wife again - I am a very honest person - but am afraid of an even worse response than the first time I raised the topic. The only other option is to have a 'fling' on the side - which would create other awful emotions - guilt, being the main one...and maybe more confusion. I am 42 and still don't know who I am. It breaks me everyday. The clock is ticking, and I have so much regret. I love my wife so much and don't want to hurt her.

Sorry that is just one amongst a world of pain and regret. i recognise the importance of staying alive for my adult son and try for myself as well. i hate these lost blank periods almost as much as the flashbacks and nightmares. Does anybody else get this? i do get psych help and no longer drink cos i needed oblivion so much but it was screwing up me and my son. So prescription only for the PTSD. Wish someone would just take my hand and walk me and my dog around safely. No thinking, just walking or other excercise. i know it helps but my motivation to get myself to the gym is zero. pip",pippab1,Community Member,22-12-2018,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trauma-triggers-in-my-intro-re-suicide/td-p/431770
PTSD-1431,"I experienced complex trauma, finding help was very difficult","A year ish ago I found help in the most unlikely place Next step. A counselor listened to my story and took action. With a few calls and inquiries she directed me towards the right support. For 2 years I searched for help, I was a mess and didn't know what I needed, and how to get it, all I knew is that my two children needed me. I have experienced complex trauma, and it manifested into disassociation, poor concentration, intrusive thoughts, anxiety, memory loss, etc. I am a work in progress and my focus atm is healing my mind body and soul. Schema therapy is working for me, but the type of therapist makes a difference. I just started doing new things like open heart meditation; eating and drinking healthy. Sometimes I struggle making positive choices; but I feel good when I do. There is no cure all because every one is different. Keep searching for what works for you because tomorrow is a new day, even if its a simple google search for happy cats and it puts a smile on your face for the day. Intrusive thoughts are horrible, so many simple things are triggers and my brain cycles on repeat. Sometimes my negative thoughts come out in word, I notice it mostly in my texts so I pause delete it and think of something positive to text. Sometimes this takes a lot of effort but I try. The most difficult is my network, I don't have one. Identifying toxic people is not my forte. I was once asked to give an example of an average healthy human adult; but honestly i don't know and google doesn't know either because I searched for hours. Since 2014 I have struggled with leaving the house but I now I feel lonely and bored. Being around other people and having a connection with someone is so rewarding and I miss it. That's what brought me to this thread tonight, its hard to find individuals that can relate to the impact of trauma and recovery.

PTSD-1432,What motivates you?,"Hi guys... i thought I’d start a new thread about what keeps us going.... for me one of the greatest things is writing here and hearing other’s journeys and discoveries. Often in times of distress or fight/freeze/flight mode we get stuck and need something to keep us going. What’s your little way of ‘turning the volume up’ so you can keep moving forward? Those struggling with ptsd are easily stopped in their tracks at times. Sometimes we just need a little bit of a boost, what’s that boost for you. For me it’s also having work to distract me so that I’m not always dwelling on my past.

PTSD-1433,Lack of Mental Health Support,"I have just started seeing a specialist trauma psychologist. I finally feel i have someone i can trust and who can actually help. Just recently i had an admission to hospital as i was totally suicidal and needed help to stop me acting on my thoughts. When first admitted to my local hospital, the specialist psych nurse was very supportive and even suggested i may need a stay in a psych hospital a few hours away. My local mental health support case manager was removed from my case and i was told that could no longer help me in the community as i was not responding like they thought i should. This was really hard to take. But i was angry and decided that was not helpful. Even the trauma psych said it was not right and i would continue to need community support as she was going on leave after the Christmas break and she was not local and only in town a few days a week. My stay in hospital was helpful until the local mental health team got involved again and without asking how i was, some chick i had only ever met once suggested i go home as i had been there for 2 nights and that was fair enough. I was very upset and told her to get lost. Still i packed my bag and told the ward nursing staff that i was going home. They were concerned for my safety and advised me not to leave and i pointed out to them that the, so called professional told me to go. So they rang the police and not long after i had made the long walk home, the police were at my door and wouldn't leave me alone. i had an appointment organised with the trauma psych and the police rang her and took me their. She took me to the hospital with the idea of advocating for me with the local mental health team. They would not respond to her calls. They also wouldn't give my daughter the name of the mental health person who told me to leave the hospital. Anyway i was once again admitted and told in emergency they were getting a nurse in to special care for me The next day the mental health team turn up again and tell me i am not being admitted to a psych hospital as they don't think i needit. They also wrote in my notes that i could go home. the dr came and they said i couldn't leave. I stated that i no longer felt safe their and had to get out. Soi went home with my daughter. she let me stay at my house alone with my animals. Now i have nowhere safe to go for help.he local mental health team ruined any chance of further assistance and ignored my pleas for help when i was most vulnerable.",Sherbet,Blue Voices Member,16-12-2018,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/lack-of-mental-health-support/td-p/428995

PTSD-1435,Triggers,"Hi all Started this thread to get a discussion going about triggers. Honestly, I have nothing planned as such for the thread. I am interested though in how people manage themselves once triggered. I was recently triggered by hearing an neighbour’s scream that sounded like she could have been sexually assaulted. Someone called the police and when I popped in to see her the next day. My hand of friendship was rejected. it’s taken me over 2 weeks to realise this was a trigger. I’d been putting it down to other things. But I couldn’t stop my -racing heart, grumpiness, withdrawal from everyone, leading to lack of energy and interest in doing things. The triggers were many * thought of someone being sexually assaulted * feeling of rejection * feeling of my inability to save someone in distress Now that I ‘be identified these. I can address each one in turn and hopefully move on and out of the depression I could feel starting to take hold. Has anyone out there a story to share about their triggers, how they identify them, or the difficulties in doing that. I finally identified this recent bout, by not sleeping. My palpitations were so bad, so I went over everything that’s happened in the last few weeks. There had been a couple of things I looked at but still couldn’t settle. Then I found it. Wow my heart lifted, stopped running. Can now think of positive thoughts, things to do. The relief of identifying cause is almost instantaneous. Now to put on that slow cook, make some gluten-free blueberry muffins. My reward! that’s it for now.

PTSD-1436,I’m scared..,"Hi guys, Last time I posted on here was like a year or so ago. I just need some advice please. When I was in high school about 4 years back I was almost sexually assaulted by a teacher, he’s in jail now but literally since that incident I have had like I don’t know how to explain it like ptsd or anxiety with physical symptoms such as nervous stomach, the runs, chills, constant worry, bad dreams and so on. I have had literally every test done at the doctors they can’t find no physical causes. That’s what angers me. I feel like I’m loosing control of my brain so to speak. And it really scares me. Like the other week I was out shopping with my mum and while we were walking I saw a man that looked almost identical to the teacher that exposed himself to me. My mum assured me the man was just some guy shopping who looked a little like him. But for that little but after I saw him I actually was in that fight or flight mode like ready for danger if that’s a better way of explaining it. I used to be a normal girl before this and now I feel like that girl I used to be is gone? I hope someone could maybe answer my post or give me some advice.

PTSD-1438,Wondering if anyone gained closure from reporting their abuser or if the investigation process is too re-traumatising to be worth it?,"Hi, this is my first time posting. I have been seeing a clinical psychologist weekly and sometimes bi-weekly for more than 12 months now to process ongoing sexual assault by my employer who was also one of my doctors. I am an absolute wreck and, while I trust my psychologist I don't trust the reporting process, the police or the objectivity of the professional bodies who need to be advised and so my therapy (and recovery) is at a standstill. I wish there was a magic wand to erase my memories of the last 5 years because I just want to forget about the whole mess and get my life back. Of course, there's no quick fix and I know I need to talk about what's happened in order to process it and move on. The problem is though that I am too scared to speak about it because I know that once I do, we have to make the necessary reports. Has anyone found that reporting their abuser helped them recover? Has anyone fully recovered from sexual abuse without making a report? I just want to feel better but I am so scared that going through the reporting process is going to make things worse.

PTSD-1441,From victim to survivor. Learning to thrive.,"Hi fellow survivors! Home is where the heart is as they say. Your sanctuary, your safe place. A place of love, guidance and support. But, for so many as I, home was none of those things growing up. We lived in fear, insecurity, under threat and in a state confusion every single day. Witnessing alcoholism and domestic violence against other family members. Ourselves being violently sexually abused, groomed and beaten by the person you should be the protector, not the perpetrator. A person of submission and domination, sadism, paedolphilia and psychopathy. Meanwhile all being protected and covered over by the victims. Blacked out and dissociated by shame and fear. Not being able to function normally in the outside world. Not understanding social interaction and hidden social rules. Being taught what was right at school to be told it’s wrong at home. Feeling alien, emotional, misunderstood but most of heartbroken and alone. Then came dissociation. The numbing. Shutting down in defeat. Turning the back on God. To grow older, develop a heart condition, endometriosis, fibromyalgia. Issues with trusting partners, explosive moods, suicidalnideation and self harm. Substance misuse as well! But you know what? A caterpillar becomes a butterfly! A fighter, a warrior, a healer, a counsellor, a lover, mother and a wife emerged. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, I rose. I keep rising. still dealing with flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, hyper vigilance and panic each day. But now, I cope, I function. I stay determined to own my life, my journey. Admiring the beauty in darkness and appreciating the immense empathy, wisdom and understanding of the human condition I have acquired. I was once indeed a victim, I then became the survivor. But just surviving is no longer enough. I am ready to thrive and I am learning fast. From dissoctaion to association. We are all connected by our experiences and I send you all the highest of love.

PTSD-1445,Realising PTSD has been there for years...(sexual assault and violence trigger warnings),"Hi, I am new to this group. Hard to know where to start so I'll mention what led me here. I'm 46, and a mum. I've battled bouts of depression since, well nearly as long as I can remember. No bipolar, history, just lows that are very dark and lonely times where I feel I am clawing myself back out to keep going. But I do keep going. In past, I have come through a sexual assault which happened when I was a teenager and then, in my 20's, witnessed a shooting at my place of work where someone was killed. I suppose I looked at possibly PTSD being short term after those events, but it's followed me the rest of my life. Then, in the past several years I realised that the strained, loveless relationship from my mother that always left me stressed and drained - was actually emotional neglect and emotional abuse. Took me until my 40's to realise that my mother was a narcissist. I've been low contact with her for 3 years now but the nastiness and lack of love, to this day, from her, feels in many ways more painful than my past traumas. I feel like I can't heal and am stuck in this vicious cycle of feeling sad and empty to fighting to get back up.....on and on. Also just realising that PTSD, is most likely why I push people away at the first sign of hurtful behaviour from them. Struggling to trust or depend on anyone and I know that's not a great way to go through life but don't know how else to cope. I do have a somewhat supportive husband but, as we have two children with special needs, things are alraedy often stressful so I can't lean on him a lot for this. Just hoping to find people here who will understand the feelings and also - has anyone specifically sought a mental health counselor who specialises in PTSD? Is that even a possibility?

PTSD-1446,Struggling with sexual abuse/molestation at young ages and dealing with it now,"It all started When I was 5 years old I was molested by my neighbour who was 12 for almost 3-4 years, to me at the time I didn't under stand what it was so I let it happen for all those years, but the worst experience of my life growing up was when I was 16 and molested by my nephew who was older than me.... I cried myself to sleep that night in the arms of my cousin, she held me and I asked her if she can keep him away from me, don't leave me alone with him ever again... I didn't tell anyone else I didn't want everyone to know, how I kept letting things happen to me. Why I'm writing this is because I'm almost 22 and I can still feel him/her touching me, forcing themselves on me, I have Flash backs, and it makes me feel so small, I struggled a lot after that, I hate men, besides my father. Have friends but never boyfriends, every time I see a male that stares, I feel as if he is undressing me with his eyes and I'm back in that dark room.... I have days where I don't wanna leave my room ,I just keep bursting into tears, not wanting to talk to others, felt so worthless, like an object, that belongs to someone else. everytime I see another flashback, I think I should talk to someone I realise I have no-one to talk to, I cried myself to sleep last night trying to think of one person I could call because my heart was hurting, but I could not think of one person to open up to...i just need some advice maybe about what I should do next because i want to do better, I don't want to keep missing out on work or on events because my sadness won't let me leave my bed or house, sometimes I actually feel happy when it's a Friday when this mood kicks in cause then I can spend all weekend in bed without having to get up and go to work. I mean I do feel happy and generally I do feel normal some days but IDK what it is? But I fall in to sadness very easily and stay that way for days. So of you can tell me what I should do?

PTSD-1447,"being believed in therapy, worry the therapist will ditch me.","I've been seeing my safe, compassionate, highly trained, very understanding psychologist, R, for about 4 years now. I've seen other therapists in the past. My psychologist, R, has kept therapy at a level I can handle it. So we've talked about day to day things for these years I've seen him, and things which make us happy- gardening, pets, art, parties, food. For as long as we've seen him. We know I've had extensive trauma in my entire life. We know I've got PTSD, and a bunch of dissociative diagnoses. Lately my flashbacks have been unbearably relentless and distressing. Not quite unbearably. I've been laying curled up in bed staring at my room or my phone. Trying to focus on small projects like online shopping, watching Netflix, writing to my psychologist (he lets me email him any time, to keep him up to date with what's happening, but he doesn't respond). So I have decided to start talking with R about my flashbacks. Mom almost crippled with fear that he will say he won't see us again if he realises the extent of my trauma, and I can imagine him believing one thing at a time but not everything. I'm absolutely sure he could be overwhelmed with everything. Which is probably transference because I'm overwhelmed by everything. Has anyone else felt like you would not be believed about your trauma, even just one single trauma? Has anyone else thought their therapist would leave if you talked about distressing things? My last therapist stopped seeing us when I think he got triggered by me. I am certain we'll lose this therapist the same. I really want to prevent that. I feel like I know him enough to trust him a lot now. Mom worried sick about these things. Literally. My stomach is completely empty from bing physically sick worrying about this. I see R on Thursday. I've emailed him my worries about talking about my trauma to him. By Thursday afternoon I'll probably be all relieved about this. Or maybe I won't be.

I react at the smallest things with anger and rage and yet feel so much guilt, i react to anxiety through nausea and stomach pains especially in social settings which leads me to have a drink...or two, i have nightmares from stress of life. I dont know i just feel as if cptsd clicks more with my symptoms than ptsd but i wasnt abused my parents just didnt know any better. But maybe im wrong i just feel trauma is different to each person it doesnt have to be the physical or even sexual abuse, it could be emotional but was not done on purpose by my parents but is an ongoing trauma i experienced in childhood that i feel had had an effect on my ability to grow as person as i get older.

PTSD-1452,Is my boyfriend sexually abusing me?,"I've been with my boyfriend for 6 months. We have sex and that part is fine. But last month, we were just laying about on his bed, nothing sexual was happening, and he randomly decided to try to initiate a sexual encounter. It caught me off guard, I said no and stop and pulled away, and instead of backing off he tried harder, as though it were some sort of challenge. He only stopped when I thrashed my arm out and it hit him in the face. I was visibly upset, he apologised and left shortly after, but I was left feeling violated and hurt like I never have before, I cried a lot and kept waking up randomly that night feeling panicked. A few days after it happened, I talked to him and explained how not okay that was, and that I expect him to stop when I say no and respect my boundaries. Recently though, it happened again. Just like last time, we were just laying about watching a movie, not engaging with each other sexually, and he asked me if he could initiate sexual contact. I trusted that he would respect my wishes when I said do X, not Y. He then proceeded anyway. In the moment I was in shock, I didn't really react. The next day I was furious that this happened again. I told him again how not okay that was, and asked him to reflect on why he did it. He kept saying ""it just happened"" and ""I don't have answers"". I asked him a string of questions to try and get to the bottom of it, and two things emerged: 1) he said he assumed that I would like it because I usually like this activity (when we're actually having sex); and 2) because I didn't explicitly say ""no"" (I said only do X, not Y), he took that to mean yes or that it was okay. I know these are both indications that he does not understand how consent works, so that may be the issue here. My concern now, in addition to trying to deal with the broken trust and hurt this has caused me, is how I can be sure it won't happen again. His lack of self-awareness and lack of willingness to face his guilt and step up to the plate to take responsibility for his mistake, makes me feel like it may happen a third time, and so staying with him would be a risk to myself. I don't think he is doing it with the intent to harm me, but clearly it is harming me. I've never been touched by anyone without my consent before. I'm struggling with what to make of all this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Anna27,Community Member,17-11-2018,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/is-my-boyfriend-sexually-abusing-me/td-p/390481
PTSD-1453,Just being diagnosed with PTSD,"Hi first time here and bit nervous. I've been an absolute mess for couple months and couldnt understand what was wrong with me and that in it self drive my sanity spiraling. I conjured every disease and felt the symptoms and was so frightening. My dad died from taking a medication 18 yrs ago by his doctor who was his golfing buddy and since then I've not been able to take anything new for fear of dying, and I was also misdiagnosed 10 yrs ago for benign intracranial hypertension which also impacted me greatly . My son has just come out the other side of a super depression and was on suicide watch. Thankfully he is on the mend and a month after is when I went into a spiral of absolute sadness and fear . For all the above trauma reared its head but wasnt aware it could happen Was so scary I didnt know what was happening to me and has taken awhile to work through but I feel immense relief I have a reason for feeling crazy . I'm not sure if others have felt relief when told that's what it is . My body is so exhausted I can hardly get the energy to get up . I was prescribed medication yesterday to ease my constant anxiety and panic but with my pill phobia its petrifying . Read to many forums . I suppose I'm just hoping now I have a diagnosis I can understand why Ivd been like I have . I've started a new psychologist today so as it's new I cant predict the outcome but not keen on taking new medications for fear of side affects. I'm not discussing medications as I know everyone is different and no one can really compare I suppose I'm looking for assurance . Thanks for reading .

PTSD-1454,Normal to feel like leaving?,"Hello, have posted before and received some very helpful advice so thought I would check in again to see if how I'm feeling is 'normal'. Past history ptsd from dv - never thought life would be ok again. But kids have kept me going. Current relationship for 4.5yrs, very understanding and caring but live seperately (yes have children together) however due to both our first relationships having children our distance between homes is 2hrs. Some days are ok but others are not. I find the ok days are when we are together, the not so good days and weeks are those when we are apart (due to first relationship children needs my partner has children 50/50). I am raising our joint children 100% and also mine from first relationship 100%). some days I just want to not deal with life, I have a fantastic job which I love, very supportive extended family who help with kids and such but not being with partner and raising all the kids is very difficult and small things set my day into chaos and I am resentful that I do it myself and only get support on the days partner doesn't have first relationship kids. today is one of those days I just feel annoyed at everything, kids playing up, house is a mess even though I had it cleaned two days ago (children's toys, clothes, towels etc) and partner is busy with other kids. I feel the relationship is going no where and just want to give up. I know this is in part the ptsd talking because it seems like dejarvu (first relationship I did 100%of all kids and house stuff even though we lived together). I admit absolutely no DV with this relationship, very thankful for that. I jist want out. Is it normal to feel like this? I hate this life like this and feeing like it's a constant circle of repetition. How can I overcome this?

PTSD-1455,Blocked out my PTSD,"I have been feeling more depressed than ever - and I've been there before - and someone reminded me tonight that I probably have PTSD from an extreme accident I was in about 8 months ago. I honestly had blocked it out so well it never occurred to me that it might still be causing or contributing to any current issues. I walked away physically unscathed. All I want now is some very specific strategies and ways to cope to help me move on. Any practical tips most welcome. Should I try medication for a short term? Is it necessary to go back and relive the trauma as I really really don't want to do that. Also, how can I possibly get my partner to understand that it really rattled me and I can't just bounce back. I still seem to be fixated with death.",Cerebrum,Community Member,15-11-2018,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/blocked-out-my-ptsd/td-p/389265
PTSD-1456,Child sexual abuse survivor,"Hi there, thanks for reading. My story starts at 11 years old I was sexually abused continuously for 5 years by my birth mothers partner until I was 16 and moved out. I reported this to the police in my 20s, they took my detailed statement, investigated and nothing has happened. I don’t know what else to do, My birth mother was told about what had happened to me and she is still with him so that says a lot about her. I’ve been estranged from family because I didn’t know what else to do. I’m now in my 30s looking at recovery. It’s just hard being alone and not having anyone to turn too.

PTSD-1457,Emotions about CPTSD Diagnosis,"I am new to Beyond Blue. I am hoping to share my experiences and opinions about CPTSD with other sufferers. I'm sure we could relate to each other's situation and perhaps share ideas about how to improve our day to day lives. Below is one of a number of definitions pertaining to CPTSD. C-PTSD is generally until now, known as a psychotic condition known to veterans of war, but thankfully more recent studies prove that this condition is prevalent in lay-persons who have also suffered an event or events that have transformed their persona, their person in its entirety. (Unknown source) I was diagnosed with Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), when I was 55 years old. Why I couldn’t have just plain PTSD is beyond me, mine had to be the complex kind, the incurable kind. After I was diagnosed with C-PTSD (which I had never heard of before), I started researching about the condition. I was desperate for information and answers. I was shocked; I was astonished to find that the information on the internet read like it had been written about me. I could see myself in every word on every page! My heart stopped beating; there was no blood in my veins, as the words exploded in my brain. The meaning of the words in the definition above sums up C-PTSD to me. ‘My person in its entirety has changed’. To me this means I am not the person I was supposed to be: I am not the person I was born to be. Well that’s just great! So who’s going to fix me? What type of cure does one seek out for this? Who is going to remedy all the havoc that has occurred over the years. The lost family and damaged relationships that I have caused, and estrangements that we have all suffered throughout the time. What treatment is going to rid me of my addiction to alcohol. If my persona has been transformed, then what the heck is my real persona supposed to look like? Perhaps I would have been a better mother to my children? A better friend, a better partner. I was robbed through my trauma as a child... my innocent soul was stolen! No wonder I had trouble relating to myself all my life! I was condemned to a life not my own! Does anyone else want to share how they felt when they were first diagnosed?",Ayisha,Community Member,15-11-2018,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/emotions-about-cptsd-diagnosis/td-p/388761
PTSD-1458,Postpartum depression & Anxiety,"Hi. I have experienced postpartum depression and long-term anxiety disorder. I am over the anxiety, finally! I benefitted from a ‘mental healthcare plan’ from my Doctor. I had 12 Psychology visits in 2010. I thought these would be all about my sexual molestation history, but they weren’t . They focused on ‘unhelpful thinking styles.’ I did the homework, & benefitted greatly. The bad memories get worse with age, but my anxiety ramped up inexplicably, nearing menopause, despite medication. It turns out I had inflammation in my gut & brain, & a Naturopath has helped eliminate that, & finally I feel relief! So it’s not always ONLY Psychological. This is worth noting, if things worsen despite feeling in control in every other way.",Tobias_Squeezer,Community Member,12-11-2018,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/postpartum-depression-anxiety/td-p/384505
PTSD-1459,Long Term Thread: Overwhelming Situations,"As Per ""Community Champions"" advice - I plan to start a long term thread. For a place that I can go when I need to let a few things go. (I hope that my words stay the same - as I'm not trying to be destructive: few of my comments previously were changed around so my points I was trying to make became quite confusing and frustrating) As a very bland, undetailed start - I started self harm at age 11, was in PMH Eating Disorders program from age 14 to 19 for Anorexia Binge/Purge type, Complex PTSD, Clinical (?) Anxiety and have heard bits and pieces in between many hospital visits and extremely short term (3 visits MAX) 'mental health councilors'. I am currently 23 + have a 3 months old son. Today I want to post what I wrote down this morning to get a metaphorical ball rolling - in hopes this is a better Idea than what I am second guessing now. --- ""I am constantly overwhelmed or underwhelmed. Fighting or obeying this perfectionism. It drives me mental. I have no feeling of content - Always needing more or much, much less. My mind works in 1000 words a minute + is increasingly hard to hone in + settle or embrace some sort of common ground, to process + accomplish. I don't even know how to begin to elaborate - If I need some help or not. My Major concern is never being 'Good enough' Secondary is feeling as though I've missed out - on living or discovering + embracing my 'self'. Things are too complicated to be one or the other. Example: I've been extremely stressed before + feel once you've dove these deep waters of Psychosis its extremely hard to determine if I am 'sad' or 'depressed' - I say, I guess I'm ""Overwhelmed"" ---",Tay13,Community Member,17-09-2018,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/long-term-thread-overwhelming-situations/td-p/389494

I relapsed already and I’m currently an impatient at an private hospital in Dandenong, (for those who don’t live in Melbourne Australia, it’s a hospital on the Mornington Penisula). Like i said above, I’ve already relapsed from just the anxiety building toward the anniversary, and where still 4 months away. Yes, it’s not the entire reason behind my relapse but it does play a massive part to the reason for my relapse. Anyways, getting off topic. I’m so anxious about the anniversary next year.

PTSD-1463,I do believe that I was in a very Manipulative Narcissistic Relationship,"Someone told me about Beyondblue, so I joined in today, as I think I really needed help even just to talk to someone, in regard of what I’m going through now. I was living with my man for more than 5 years and I realised and do believe that he’s suffered with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I know I can’t diagnose someone with such an illness without professional test, but after with him in a period of time he has all the symptoms known to man. Five years ago our relationship starts so amazing and wonderful, and I even thought I’d meet my soulmate. He’ll do anything & everything for me, very protective, very thoughtful, sending dozens roses to work. After 6 months things had changed showing the red flags he has the control of everything from the food shopping, the food we eat, all of our financials we have joint account, he’ll decide what clothes I wear, which friends I can see. My son (not his son) moved out as my partner has an OCD problem, and he use it as his ticket just to nagged us and told us how dirty we were. In the last couple years situations gotten worsts it’s gone from south to north. He became very verbally abusive, put me down, nagger, call me names, counting everything he does, and me not doing anything. I feel like walking on eggshells, there’s a time when I sat down in sofa after work, I have to get up quickly pretend I’m doing something when he arrive home. Because he’ll get up me for sitting in the lounge and not doing anything. There’s a time that we had screaming match and he’d told me that he wishes me to die and rot somewhere. I haven’t told any of my family members about this as I was so embarrassed. I’d hang on to this relationship because we bought a property together with my only deposit in it in the beginning of the relationship. He’d manipulate me to change job from good paying nurse to poorly paid labourer Now I moved out as our relationship becomes so intense, toxic and violent he keeps knives under bed,pillow spare gun in the bedroom, also I found a hidden camera in my room. I don’t trust him anymore, I felt so violated I don’t know what to do as he wanted me to go back. If not he’ll make the sale of the property so difficult.I love him with all of me. Now he’s angry, makes me feel guilty for leaving him & not talking to me. I feel so bad and worried about him, I’m so confused, Please anyone can help me think through as I’m very confused not coping well. I want to moved on but it’s so hard.

PTSD-1468,Living with PTSD for 54 years,"Hi all, Just wanted to share my experience. I had always felt my childhood was unhappy, but I could not understand why. When I was 12 I developed asthma and throughout my 20s and 30s I'd have these moments of unexplained 'anger outbursts'. I developed strategies to manage this anger because I hated it. I also found I was never comfortable with women friends and it was difficult trusting anyone. I drank to excess, picked men up for one night stands. Then I met my husband of 35 years. It turned my life around, I could finally trust someone and share a fulfilling life. I just believed my behaviour was normal for the loose 'sexual years' of the 60s and 70s. Then 7 years ago while travelling through a town I remembered I'd been there on a holiday when I was about 11 or 12. My mother and father dropped me off with some cousins of mum's for a week or so. I never remembered anything until 7 years ago, when we stopped for coffee. I said to the person behind the counter oh, I know xxxxxxxx and xxxxxx. The response was 'they're dead'. That was it. As we travelled out of the town I started getting 'pornographic images' (something that was totally unusual for me). I talked it over with my husband - saying how strange it was. Well, that was roller coaster for me. I can't imagine how I could have kept the sexual abuse (rape) locked away in my memory for so long. My health suffered, I went into major depression and anxiety. I could not believe what was happening to me. My whole world turned upside down. For months I cried my heart out with a psychologist until I could no longer function and had to cease work. The GP put me on antidepressants and I saw my psych almost daily for about 2 weeks. I finally went back to work after about 3 months and more recently retired. Since retirement - my PTSD has been triggered. I've worked for 50 years and kept on the move one way or the other. I now have to face life full on. There are neighbours who have volatile arguments - this has been my latest trigger. My psychologist has retired and I don't like my new one. Ugh.... I want to sleep, but it doesn't come at the right time - night time. I can go to sleep about 5am and wake at 11am. But that's not what i want...Wow, have I had a whinge or what. There are many more people out there who had it a lot worse. My life has been good considering. I only wish I could have remembered the trauma earlier.

PTSD-1469,Triggers and how to cope with PTSD attack,"Hello, i am new to this but here goes. I need help coping and strategies to deal with a PTSD attack. I experienced physical and mental trauma when I was younger and I also watched my little brother be beaten and there wasn’t much I could do to stop it or protect him. As I got a lot older I distance myself from my mother and more recently removed her from my life as I released evey time she would contact me I would have memories, flash backs and dreams. Things have been good but my mother has been trying to reach me to talk to me the last two days and tonight when I went to have a shower all these memories things I have tried to forget are trying to flood back in. I feel panicked and scared, ashamed and I feel this crazy urge to protect my family despite logically knowing she is a very long way away from me. Is there anything I can do to stop the memories I have identified my mother and showers are triggers. I have a vividly horrible memory of my brother being hurt in the shower which sometimes plagued my mind and is usually the first memory. I recently also had a little fire scare in my house and completely over reacted and then I had a flash back of when a pot was on fire when I was little and I was left to deal with it. Although this last memory is inspiring me to be a firefighter the other memories I have a very crippling effect.

PTSD-1470,Shouted and swore at boss,"Hi. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and subsequent anxiety following the death of my mum who I cared for for the last 10 years of her life.

PTSD-1472,"Writing a letter to my parents, my mum in particular","""I'm writing to you because it is easiest for me. You may call it cowardly but that's your opinion. It's less scary and causes me less anxiety to do it this way. You have conditioned me to fear confrontation and cry as soon as I hear shouting. You have been a good parent to me for the most parts, providing for me and (My sister). But you've also done some horrible things. Shouting and insulting me until I'm in tears and then getting more angry when I start crying. A mother's natural response to their child in distress should be to comfort them, not to shout or sometimes laugh and ridicule them. And to be more specific, the reason I've been avoiding you and dad is from the other day. Dad threatened to hurt me. He threatened to kill his own daughter. Over some cats. I understand I took it too far, and I was stopping as I had previously told you. But that doesn't justify what he said to me, or how I'm being treated. And it doesnt justify you allowing him to say that to me. Arent you worried that your husband threatened to kill me? You know why I kept cat sitting for as long as I did, you know how difficult it is for me to get a job, to talk to people, to make friends. I was doing my best to make an income and get through uni. You seem to forget how stressful university actually is, and how much work I have to put in. I will apologise for what has happened with the cats, as I have in the past. The only reason foxy was out was to make dad happy. But I will not apologise for being upset, scared, and avoiding you. If you can't understand why then there isn't much more I can say. I'm telling you all of this because despite what has happened you're still my parents and I want to continue to have a relationship with you two. I'm grateful for everything you've done for me to help me become who I am. But if you can't see that what happened was wrong, I'm not sure what more I can do. I have other people that will care for me and protect me. I'm not trapped here. And if you're confused about anything, I'm happy to have someone else talk to you about it too. Because you laugh this off and forget about it, but I don't. This is serious and effects my life.

PTSD-1473,How to explain PTSD to another?,"As title says, how do you explain to someone close to you what PTSD is or means in your life? How do you explain how certain things control your life or daily routine that you simply can't change for fear of what might happen if you do? i left a relationship many years ago, have since been diagnosed with PTSD due to dv, mainly all mental/controlling techniques he used but two occasions where I wasn't sure if I would see the sun again. I am now struggling to let my partner about the actual depth of my past, whilst I've been very open with the situation and what I and the kids went through, I've never let on about diagnoses (ptsd and depression) but I fear it will sound like I want sympathy (I don't, I'm strong enough) but I really want to be able to explain why I feel the way I do about being in certain situations or visiting specific areas of town. I've moved a distance away from my ex and do not want to go back near that area. i believe I need to be very honest about my pat but I just can't find words to explain it... I don't look broken nor would anyone other then drs and psych even think there is something going on behind the scene with me. appreciate any advice thank you",Needingadvice2018,Community Member,17-10-2018,PTSD and trauma,10,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-to-explain-ptsd-to-another/td-p/428624
PTSD-1474,Something beyond CPTSD,I was diagnosed with CPTSD three years ago.I was devastated to learn that it is incurable. I had always hoped that whatever condition i had had almost all of my life would have some remedy. But that is not the case. I was so resentful about my trauma as a child. I grieved for my lost persona. I wondered what type of person i was supposed to be like. It was all a shock to me. I had enormous support from my psyche and my 3rd husband. I was angry for a long time... but i had no choice but to accept my fate and try and work with it the best way i could. I had to find way to obtain something beyond CPTSD! But even though it is three years on...i still hold some resentment.

Going through the motions of a diagnosis at the moment and my GP recommended I come here for support and advise. The nightmares are starting to really get to me, my partner also snores like a demon and I often have to resort to sleeping on the lounge, and when I finally DO get to sleep, I wake up almost every hour, heart racing and covered in sweat. How does everyone cope with their demons when asleep? Previously in my life I have abused drugs to escape and get a decent nights sleep but with the kiddo now hanging around I really don't want to resort back to shit like weed to get a decent nights sleep.

PTSD-1477,Am I doing the right thing?,"Hi, I have been suffering from ptsd, anxiety, depression and social anxiety. I was held up in a grocery store almost 3 years ago and it has completely changed my life. I used to be such a care free person and just genuinely happy now I don’t sleep, I am anxious wherever I go, I have missed out on great things like my sisters 18th birthday and even just being able to go to the shops by myself. I hate how I am and I try so hard to feel better. After it all happened I was off work for about a year and then because I lived out of home with my partner we were struggling so much that I just went back to work and said I was okay (My partner did not want me to but I insisted) I didn’t think we had any other options. I was back for about 4 months and I kept getting worse, I almost lost my job as I would stay up all night not being able to sleep and then go to work, and sometimes I was so tired I’d physically feel sick, so I would call in sick to work. Maybe a month later my mum had a talk to me and said she noticed how on edge I was and how I was just always angry and she told me I think I should leave again. I agreed as I was so exhausted mentally and physically and I knew it wasn’t doing any good for me. Because the pay is small and my partner actually got laid off work as there was no more work for him we lost our house and had to move in with my parents. But the real point of this post is insurance companies. My one is incredibly pushy and make me do things that I don’t want to by threatening to take away my small $$ I get every week. They muck me around so much, adding new people into the case, I’ve caught them lying. And just the whole situation is sketchy. I do everything they ask. The one who handles my case is not nice at all, she has no sympathy and makes me feel like I’m just lazy. Which is so silly, why would anyone want this life. Anyway it’s gotten so bad lately (especially because they want me to travel 3 hours away for an appointment) that I was thinking of studying full time as I thought it would be a good start for some structure in my life. Although Tafe requires work placement and I just can’t. I’m not ready. So I thought University! But it requires a $200 fee just to apply which I cannot afford. What are some other options? I was thinking Centrelink until I save up enough money to pay for university. I am just not sure how it all works and what I am entitled to. Thank you for listening to me!

PTSD-1478,PTSD - Does 'wellness' and 'safety' trigger a fear response?,"It has with me.. I'd like to discuss exposure to health, vitality and safety after traumatic experiences. My recovery's in full swing, yet I'm still avoiding life; the good bits. Why? Change can have amazing benefits for personal growth. Those of us who experience fear responses to ptsd triggers, know how debilitating it can be. So when enough work's done to progress onto living life fairly normal, how do we cope? It's so new and foreign. People reading this might say; ""OMG! What's she complaining about?! Getting well?!"" Yep! In a nutshell... I don't ruminate anymore; I've let go of the past and not obsessing over the future. I live a simple life without too many problems, (unless I create them myself) can effectively deal with situations that trigger and have mastered mindfulness. Yay great! What now? My life's now like an experiment on a daily basis. A lot of my childhood coping strategies caused thru trauma are now on the back-burner. What replaces them? I've been on a mission to heal my broken mind and have come leaps and bounds. Now it's time to live life without trauma or threat of it and I'm flailing. It might not make sense to some, but I'm hoping it does with others. Habitual thinking and responses are just that; a habit. Forming new one's that aren't a response to danger is challenging me. Is there anyone out there who understands or wants to discuss this confusing topic? Existing and new members are welcome to contribute..

PTSD-1479,Suffering within myself,"my fiancé of 7 years has been accused of sexual assult from my 19 year old sister.She left home to our pastors house and told his daughters about it and all her ffriends. We didn’t find out till a week later when my mum told her to come home now. She told my mum, mum told me, then I flipped. I got her side of the story and it seemed so real. It just made no sense to me. It happened at 4am when he was getting ready for work, it was in the lounge room which is right next to the kitchen and it had happened with me sleeping in the next room, my parents in the next one and my brother and his gf and the one after that. It just made no sense. I called my oldest brother (not the one that lives with us), told him about it and he believed my fiance immediately. It just seems ridiculous. Ever since we’ve been walking on eggshells, she had told our cousins who then got involved and took her to their house and kept her a2ay from us. She then turned on us saying we were animals for protecting a rapist. I’m so scared because my fiancé has been accused of a criminal offence and don’t know what could happen. She said she was going to report him to the police and hope he rots in jail. I have so much anxiety and so does he. Worried someone will find him and try to take vengeance for something he didn’t do. My worry is that she’s told so many people . I keep thinking about the fact that I’m the reason everyone is still fighting. If I just broke up with him it would be over. But I love him so much and don’t believe it for a second. I’m suffering so much with this pain.

PTSD-1481,Narcissistic abuse after divorce.,"Hi everyone, I’m new & wanted to share my story I’ve been divorced 3 yrs. But my ex & his partner are a thorn in my side. I’ve been in a new loving relationship for 2 yrs & I have complete trust in my new partner, no worries about him cheating & lying which my ex did constantly. So it seems I didn’t bring any of that into the new relationship which is great. My ex & I have 3 kids. Which means I’m stuck having to deal with him. It’s gotten better over time. But there’s still moments where he’s extremely nasty. I’ve been to therapy & I always come across strong & independent. Eventually though something happens to retraumatise me. I do the typical things like, I disassociate myself from what I went through, I play mind numbing games, research, read articles or tv series to avoid thinking about it. I put myself down & imagine him berating me & have ridiculous arguments/conversations in my head, especially in the “think tank” (shower). I have dreams about both of them not leaving me alone. I fear succeeding as I don’t want their ‘spotlight’ on me. I completely put myself down. I’ve have been ill since I met him & my health has declined from constant stress, I have severely low iodine, low B12 & high cortisol. I avoid being social because I’m not a very outgoing person anyway, & my ex & his partner (the last one he cheated on me with) are a big part of the same community, so therefore I feel isolated in my own home town. They’ve stalked me, twice she did a U-turn & followed me to the supermarket, driving past my home (I now live with my parents so they stopped), following the kids from school & grilling them about where I am, what I’m doing, etc. My ex admitted he has her inform him- eg. I took pics of our child at an event she was also at & within 30mins he texts me demanding copies of the pics. It has left me wondering what I did wrong? I didn’t make him cheat/lie/manipulate in the first place. He gaslighted me constantly & they both have started gaslighting the kids. He’s always put himself on a pedestal. There’s times he leaves me alone, or he just can’t get dirt due to the low profile I keep, but he’ll eventually find something, big or small. All I want is to communicate about pick up/drop off times. But he gets mad about ridiculous things, demands respect, which triggers my anxiety & causes a sudden downward spiral, my chest hurts, hands shake & sometimes I cry. I hope to find a new counselor who understands Narcissistic abuse.

PTSD-1482,What do I do,"My wife (same sex marriage) abused me 5 days ago. She was jealous I was on my phone when we had guests around watching the AFL grand final. She called me into our bedroom (with our friends outside) and physically hurt me. I took myself to hospital and they admitted me for observation due to concussion. I also have physical trauma. The abuse has happened before, on and off. Always due to rage and jealousy and trust issues. I’ve never done anything wrong, never cheated, never text anyone and deleted messages, never been sneaky. It’s a cycle. She will abuse me, the next day apologise (sometimes I’ve even apologised) and then we have a honey moon phase where everything is fantastic. My wife and I married August 11th 2018. 8 months leading up to the wedding everything was fine. She was hardly ever jealousy. Her anger was better managed and I thought “she is changing”, I thought this was the start of our forever. After she abused me Saturday and I was discharged from hospital Sunday I went straight to my mums. My partner has confided in her mother and her mother has helped seek help. She rings and texts and says she is so sorry and knows it is wrong. Her mother also blames her father as he abused her mother and cheated on her and that’s why my wife has these rage inside of her. And that with help she is certain she can get better. i am at a stage now where I do not want to salvage my marriage. I’m exhausted. I don’t believe she can change. Even though she is seeking help. I just feel extremely bad that I want to end our relationship when she is about to seek help but I can’t wait in limbo and support her in hopes she changes. We are catching up on Sunday to talk and I want to know what others opinions of me wanting to end this. As we are married I don’t know if we can “break up”.

PTSD-1484,Struggling to cope with past experiences (sexual assault trigger warning),"Hey, I’m new here. I’m a sexual assault and emotional abusive survivor. I came through the other side in 2006 but I was left with a few demons. He would tell me I was too skinny and ugly and would force feed me as a way of emotional control. One particular time I had gastro and you know when you’re sick the last thing you want to do is eat but I was force fed and I was subjected to a weekend of various abuse. Since my experience, a few things changed, one of which I started having relationships with females. Having a relationship with female seemed more comfortable, equal. Also since my experience, my eating changed, I have problems with control and eating. 12 years on I did get married, to a very understanding man who puts up with my quirks and I felt I had moved on with life. However recently, I had a situation where I confided in my doctor, who crossed the line sexually, pursuing a friendship over text message and in person with questions about my sex life, why I’m bisexual, how do you have sex with women and information about my past sexual experiences. He asked me questions about having sex with men and my husband and I guess it was a fantasy for him. When I went to my husband for help, my doctor tried to tell me what he was asking was no big deal, that it had nothing to do with my husband and just between us and went to my husband saying that I was having an affair, I’m an escort but my husband put him in his place and reported him to the medical board. Six months on, I’m feeling fundamentally broken. I feel like the lid I had firmly on my past experiences has been re-opened with everything spilling out, or I feel like a mirror I was holding has been taken from and thrown to the ground. I tell myself I feel I’m overreacting, or it shouldn’t be a big deal, it's not like the doctor touched me and was only aroused by what I sent him but I am constantly anxious because it’s triggered everything and I don’t know why. I’m struggling to control my eating, I’ve stopped being intimate with my husband, just feel so withdrawn. I don’t want to be touched or hugged by anyone and I get angry, I have these fits of anger that I don’t know where they come from… but it’s pure rage. I’ve been medicated by psychiatrists but it’s not helping at all and I just don’t know what’s wrong with me.",chiara_g,Community Member,28-09-2018,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-to-cope-with-past-experiences-sexual-assault-trigger/td-p/405421
PTSD-1485,Is it ever okay to reconcile with abusive partner?,"Hi, I’ve posted a few times before about my husband who physically and sexually assaulted me a few months ago. It was very violent and I’m still dealing with the effects of being assaulted by someone I loved and trusted. He breached an avo after the assault and ended up in prison for 5 weeks. This experience seems to have changed him for the better. We have young children together and while he has never been physically abusive in the past, he has been verbally abusive to both me and our children. He is desperate to reconcile and says he has “seen the light” and will never hurt me again. I don’t want to reconcile. I feel broken after what he did. But I could probably take him back for the sake of our children. My question is, is it ever okay to take back someone who has hurt you so badly? Is there ever a reason? I don’t think I love him anymore, but I care about him still. We were together over a decade and he was my only relationship. He wasn’t a supportive partner, except financially so I am more than capable of raising our 3 children alone. But should I? Should I give him a chance? My biggest worry is that he will hurt me again - not necessarily physically - and that I won’t be able to pick myself up next time. Maybe I am just being selfish. If he has changed then shouldn’t I give my children the nuclear family they deserve? I’m so confused. I know it’s my decision, but I could use some advice/guidance.

Also it's going to be a long post which will be multiple posts. Sorry... ""trigger warning"" i suppose. Basically i'm depressed for insane reasons. I was sexually abused by a relative as a kid which honestly doesn't bother me so much, but as a result of experiencing this so young i developed irregular behaviours of all kinds. Between i guess what must have been 4 and 9 years of age I had developed sexually inappropriate behaviours towards other kids, the type which i found out as an adult are considered very serious and are suppose to be reported to protective services or authorities of some kind. I don't know if the adults around me didn't catch on or were idiots OR just straight up neglectful but these behaviours went unchecked. I'm in my late 20's now and though all such behaviours had disappeared by the time i was 10 or so i feel absolutely disgusted by them even being a thing that i did as a kid. To put it bluntly i feel like my body and genetics are a disgusting product of a disgusting genetic ancestry full of disgusting people. Other behaviours i developed were severe anxieties, depressive, attachment and defiant disorders, explosive rage attacks with little provocation, fear of taking clothes of around people, bed wetting until a late age, mentally regressive behaviours all of which were more or less ignored and treated with ADD medication. I believe i was mostly seen as ""a little shit who needs a good smacking"". Most of these problems went away by the time i was 10 except for the severe anxiety, depression and anger issues which all got extremely severe from around age 12-14.

I think it’s best to provide some background information about me to paint the picture. I suffered abuse from my mother from ages 3-9; everything from physical to sexual. This was because a myriad of things. 1: my mother was an alcoholic and a drug addict. 2: she had untreated mental disorders. 3: I displayed lesbian tendencies as a child and she was against that. So, mother forced me to grow my hair, wear feminine clothes, be feminine and date boys (since I was 4). I’ve been living with my dad since I was 9. I’ve had problems with self-harm and suicide tendencies/attempts since I was 7 (I’m safe, don’t worry). I’ve been doing counselling on and off for 10 years and have been dabbling in prescribed medication for about 6 months, though I stopped because they caused me to relapse in self-harming. I was diagnosed with GAD when I was 13, but then was diagnosed with PTSD last year. As a result, I have no idea who I am. I never established a sense of self because my mum forced me to be something that I wasn’t. I don’t know my morals, personality, or my fashion sense. I look in the mirror and feel confused and afraid. I can’t make any decisions and I have no direction in my life. I don’t know how to act or interact with others, so I just stay at home. I don’t have a desire for anything and literally do nothing, as I have no hobbies. I don’t have any friends, so seeking guidance from friends is impossible. I just feel very empty and confused. My counsellor is no help, she acts so patronising and I lie to make it seem like I’m better than what I am. I haven’t told my doctor or my counsellor that I’m off my medication and I feel so trapped. I honestly don’t know what to do. Please help!",Ramm,Community Member,27-08-2018,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/treatment-advice-trigger-warning-sexual-abuse/td-p/360084
PTSD-1495,Ptsd or not ptsd,"Hi there, I’ve a few threads going on but mostly under depression..... But Im here to clarify whether my symptoms are ptsd or simply major depression with anxiety. 2012, things were okay in life if a little stressful. I had issues with my gallbladder and finally decided to have it taken out. Was a little anxious as normal, like who likes surgery even if it’s elective. Had my gallbladder removed, was only supposed to be overnight. To cut a long story short the surgeon found something that he thought wasn’t right. I asked if it was cancer and he said maybe. I felt sad and wanting to be with my family but stayed another night. After more tests he said it was highly likely it was cancer. My world fell apart. I felt so scared and anxious. I didnt want to have cancer nor die from it. I was beside myself. I felt highly anxious as I couldn’t get it out of my mind. I was also depressed because it involved the liver. Highly likely went to 99% sure. I seeked reassurance from lots of people to put my mind at ease and I found it so hard to function. Seeked a second opinion and was told it was very unlikely it was canver. It was something but he wasn’t sure. The uncertainty continued but the anxiety has subsided a bit. Still quite emotional. Had an ercp and found it was just a dislodged stone stuck there. All clear. My worry has completely gone. Mind you the word cancer sent shivers up my spine but I simply moved on with life. Move to 2014, and I wanted to have my prostate checked as I had inconsistent wee. The worry returned but it wasn’t debilitating one bit. It was just worry. Had another check up but the day I was waiting for the results I couldn’t keep my mind away from the thoughts. I was quite anxious and stressed. The results came through and I was ok. It was nothing tablets couldn’t settle. Two weeks after that I started to feel my anxiety begin to re emerge. I was feeling weird and worried about little ailments. Before you know it I was in full blown anxiety and overly emotional. The anxiety was the killer. I couldn’t sit still. The adrenaline was overpowering. The sadness was intense. I didn’t feel safe on my own. I didn’t suffer from flashbacks. I didn’t suffer from any nightmares. It was full blown anxiety. It felt like a nervous breakdown but my psych said it was trauma. I didn’t get it. He said it will come good in a number of weeks. Nup!! I was gone. I wasn’t convinced it was that. A year after this happened I lost my marriage and family.

PTSD-1496,Hi all - my battles.,"Hi all New to the BB forums. I'm a male in my late thirties. I've battled depression for much of my life due to a long list of issues * My father died when I was 18. Less than 3 months later I started caring for my mother 24/7 for over three-years 90% of which she was couch (not even bed) bound until she died a week before my 22nd birthday * I lost several close friends including my first girlfriend in a car accident when I was 16 * In my twenties I overcame a car accident (23), cancer (24), stroke (26) and an international imprisonment for crimes I did not commit (27-29). My thirties have been fairly good by comparison: * Completed multiple university degrees * Have worked for successful international companies and brands * Raised a lot of money for worthy causes * Volunteered at the Comm Games and other events Unfortunately, the only actual 'job' that I've held since moving to my current city -- beyond freelancing -- was for a seedy company who prayed on the weak/poor. This tore my soul out. And it's taken me almost three years to find proper employment since. Thankfully these are issues that I've worked on, and for the most part, have put behind me. Recently, I have started what I hope is the most satisfying and meaningful relationship I'll be a part of. She's an amazing young woman who has all of the characteristics that I am looking for in a partner and an equal. She's someone that I can talk to more than anybody I've ever been able to talk to. I am blessed to have her in my life and grateful. About a week ago I opened up to her about a topic that I had never opened up about before -- my sexual abuse at the hands of two of the three different people -- in my early years through to mid-to-late teens. This led to our first argument because I didn't want to see her as a counselor and I didn't want her to view me as one. She went to bed and didn't speak to me for the rest of the night. I then entered the self-sabotage mindset that I occasionally do when the shit hits the fan (again, our first major misunderstanding, etc.). I posted a lengthy post on Facebook tagging my friends and loved ones (including her) in on the post and divulged details about the third (and most significant) sexual abuse events (that I didn't tell her about the night before). This is my new battle. I'm not sure where to start. I've lined up a counseling session. However, I've succeeded in beating and battling the others. I'll conquer this one too.

PTSD-1497,"seeking identification with others! Feeling numb, lost and defeated","I didn't exactly have the easiest of upbringings but I have enough life experience to know that I had it better than some. Considering my personality though, it has from the opinion of my nearly sourced clinical psychologist (1st apt) had a profound effect on the first years of life after leaving home at 18. Anxiety, depression, paranoia (distrust of people and their intentions), substance use issues, some homelessness and a sexual assault (minor compared to what it could've been) by a male at the age of 21, was the first 4 years of my life post leaving home. Couldn't hold down work and was constantly leaving jobs and getting new work due to the above first 3 issues raised. I traveled back home to where I was born at the age of 21 and a year later my brother suicided and it destroyed any semblance of faith that I had in myself, life and others. I've never been the same since. My best friend died 6 years later. In Nov 2015 and I entered a 12-step fellowship to learn how to live life clean and to attempt to clear up my life confusion and the wreckage of my past. although I was able to really work on myself over 3 yrs through working the steps (I got up to half way through step 10) I found that my faith in it being able to help me to get me to a point of being employable again stopped working for me. I started seeing the fellowship for what it really was, not what I wanted it to be. Anyway, I pulled away. The 12th anniversary of my brothers death is coming up pretty soon and every year that it comes around, I'm utterly incapable of staying sane through it. It re exposes me to the trauma and body memories of it every year. I ended up picking up some drugs after being 9.75 months clean due to everything that I was feeling coming up to this anniversary (numbness, fear and self-pity) and my mental health has already taken a dive yet again. I have a lot of therapy to get through and I just feel like it's too little too late; one appointment a fortnight? I feel completely overwhelmed, and like the services that are ment to be there to help people with the array of issues that someone like me may have, has it's doors closed due to government greed and stigma and I feel helpless. Any suggestions that may help? Meds never worked. I already walk for an hour a few times a week and eat healthy. I will be stopping the drugs again in a week or less. The longer that I use, the worse that I'm going to feel. I know this from experience. 34 yo male.",Hope4tomorrow,Community Member,08-09-2018,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/seeking-identification-with-others-feeling-numb-lost-and/td-p/376576
PTSD-1498,Mental and Emotional Abusive Relationship,"Hi. I was in an emotionally, mentally and psychologically abusive relationship from march - May. I lived with him and he controlled every aspect of my life. He is also one of my staff members so processed all my paperwork etc. We still work in the same area which is where all my anxiety is coming from. I have a TPO against him and today I spent 5.5hrs with him waiting for court. He was staring at me for most of the day. He does this often because we work together. I hate it but I can’t stop it. My workplace don’t care hence why they haven’t moved either of us. Tonight, specifically, I am exhausted. All day I’ve been putting on an act because I didn’t want him knowing how badly I’m coping but now that I’m alone and there’s no one here, I’m exhausted. My emotions have been all over the place because now I want him to know how I’m not coping. I’m scared that I still care for him because I don’t know if this is a normal feeling. We did remain friends because of work but he found out about a guy I was seeing and lost it completely. That’s when he started abusing me and making my workplace unsafe. But now, I’m at work and constantly looking around for him, my hands shake, I sweat uncontrollably, I’ve been waking up at 2-3am in a huge pool of sweat every night. I’m dehydrated. I’m drinking double what I usually do but I’m just sweating it out at night. My mouth is always dry. I come home and I’m absolutely exhausted. I feel like I’m on high alert all the time. He has been parking next to me at work. I have had a tension headache for the past week. It comes on stronger when I think of him but it’s always in the background. I’ve been told by a psych that I show signs of PTSD, anxiety and depression. My appetite is gone tonight. Everything is such a challenge. Even simple things. It takes so much energy to hate him.

PTSD-1499,Need help after controlling/abusive relationship,"I spent 12 years in an emotionally and physically controlling relationship. I have 2 beautiful boys to this person so it was not easy to leave. He controlled every aspect of my life and I was a possession to him. A lot of the time, a sexual possession. He was always with me or messaging or calling to check in on me so that constant contact became normal to me. He also completely destroyed my self esteem and left me thinking I’m worthless. My problem now nearly 5 years after leaving, I have so many issues that I can’t make a relationship work. I seek attention from other men even if I’m in a happy relationship. I don’t know why this is. and need help figuring it out coz it’s ruining my life!! I’ve recently split from partner of 2 1/2 years and at times I was so irrational and needy with him that I can’t believe we lasted so long. I seem to be seeking that constant attention that I had from my abusive partner. I was also so used to being sexualised that I felt my bf since didn’t love me or want to be with me because he didn’t treat me the same way. I did seek attention elsewhere even though I was completely in love with my partner. A couple messages with a old school friend in another state including a provocative pic (not naked) and I’ve destroyed any chance of being with the man I loved and wanted to spend my life with. I dont know why I made such a huge mistake and hiw I could hurt to person I love. I need to know why I’m like this and if I can be fixed..

PTSD-1500,I would like to reach out to those experienced with PTSD as a personal diagnosis...,"I was diagnosed with PTSD by a Psychologist about 9 years ago. I would like to reach out to those who have had a similar diagnosis or medical and trained professionals answering this forum. I was found abandoned as a child, within a war zone. I was then placed into an orphanage, 5 kids to a cot, and then was adopted by well-meaning Caucasian parents. I am only now interested in visiting a Psychiatrist and asking them to use FMRI (?) technology to show this diagnosis as clearly operating within my brain. I am not certain that I want to submit to a Psychiatrist's diagnosis and confirmation of PTSD, WITHOUT scientific and visual proof. If it is the case, I would like to follow the course of counselling, medication or monitoring where relevant. Apart from certain ""obvious""indicators which show my behaviour to be very different to the average or normal person in terms of relationships and responses to change etc (I am happy to discuss these symptoms in much greater detail if you have been diagnosed with PTSD or are a Medical professional etc), one of the most obvious symptoms is waking every morning at the same time, regardless of where I am located in the world. Sleep can be interupted, especially if there is an important appointment I need to attend the following day. I have an extraordinary memory for the long term past, but my short term memory can see me forget something of detail within 5 minutes. I can also get lost easily with or without the help of Google Maps! Lol. And a simple journey of just 10 kms can take me several hours if I get disoriented. How would I say that it affects my personality overall? Deep suspicion and inability to trust others, inability to sustain friendships, wary of emotional connection, these are just some cursory notes on who I present myself to be in the world. If I am to believe that I have had this disorder, my personality has grown up with it, and functioned despite of it...if that makes sense. I would be very interested to know your symptoms, observations, discussions with medical professionals... as I haven't yet received those images from a Psychiatrist yet, but even before or upon receiving them, I would like to understand this diagnosis in far greater depth. I hope that this briefly outlines what I would like to chat about. What are your experiences? Can you relate to anything that I am talking about too?

PTSD-1501,Potential PTSD - own daughter a trigger,"Hi, first post so here goes. I've never really spoken to a professional about the following. All of my sessions have focused on my Bipolar and my daughters ADHD etc. However, my daughters now 10, starting puberty and more and more I'm reflecting/ thinking about my childhood closer to that age. When I was about 12yrs old starting high school I made a new best friend. Her mum was quite young (had her at 16) worked nights/ weekends as a cleaner, and so me and my friend spent most of the time with mums boyfriend. He was a heavily tattooed biker gang type. When I was 13 he brought us alcohol and gave us pot for New Years Eve. Now for the triggering stuff... The first night I slept over I got up in the night for the bathroom and he was walking around naked. I was shocked and went back to bed but never told my parents. Things then escalated over nearly 2 years. I'm sure my friend had been sexually abused by him since he'd been in her life (from 8yrs). That New Years I mentioned - I blacked out big sections (think it's ok) but woke to find her in skimpy pjs cuddling him on his bed. I only mentioned any of this to my dad in my mid 20s when I was supporting my sister explaining an abuse by an uncle. For many years this impacted on sexual activities I wouldn't do etc. I received a friend's request a few years ago from the girl and I declined, it spooked me and I couldn't face the conversation. I've always felt guilty about not going to the police. Another friend mentioned later that lots of kids knew what was happening... Now my daughter is nearing this same age and it's making me think more and more about it. Who knows what her friends are like. Is it possible to have PTSD from witnessing something like this, and for it to rear up so long after? I'm thinking this is something I need to bring up with my psych and possibly see a psychologist about?

PTSD-1502,Covert Narcassist Psychopath Abuse,"Hello all, After 4 weeks of no contact with my partner of 20 years, reality has hit me with why life with him was sucking my life, literally. Anyone who has recovered from narcasstic or other dark triad personality disordered partners, please reach out. The master manipulator, as I am told my professionals, is a covert narcasstic psychopath, as he lacks empathy, remorse and even denies strangling me, which is when experts forced me out. Since then I learn about emotional, psychological abuse, cycle of violence, power and control, DV, and about the disorders. All while seeking a place to be safe. Currently no support around me and I know it's not me, rather him, as he projects himself onto me to others, saying I am abusive and the victim depressed play. Still, I am isolated and deprived and reach out in hope of anyone being compassionate and empathic to just be a friend. It is not healthy to be isolated, just like having someone you thought you loved trauma bond you and intentionally enjoy hurting in hope to gain control. I only loved and trusted but no fool after being awakened yo the truth. I know I grieve, loss and trauma recover. However, to reach out is healthy, since despite my proactive resourceful nature, everything else I tried has not succeeded. Like to connect honestly, learning the red flags of such energy emotional vampires now, as honesty builds trust and I have little energy to be anyone other than me. Thank you for your time and reaching out. Balancing my healing with energy cost to meet new people I don't have energy to engage with without such truth.

I’ve lost enjoyment in everything I used to love. I think about suicide a lot but would never do it. I’ve been sexually assaulted multiple times but never fully raped. However I get extremely emotional about it even though it happened years ago. Every night before bed I think of scenarios in which I’m raped or assaulted. I get these feelings of immense sadness and feel worthless but immediately I say I am extremely privileged my parents are paying for my uni I’ve never been raped I have no reason to feel this way. I don’t even cry anymore I just lay down for entire days because the way I feel stops me from doing anything. Idk if it’s depression or anxiety- I don’t consider my self an anxious person and when I’m out with people you would think the opposite of depression but when I’m alone thinking of who I am I feel nothing but hate. Is there a certain type of depression this may be?

PTSD-1505,Domestic violence,"am a victim of domestic violence and have 6 children. I have been dealing with the family court, civil court and wapol. For the last 2.5 years. My ex husband severely abused the children and myself for 16 years. We have battled with the court system and police with limited understanding and the inability to cross reference documents across all three services. We are currently protected by a fvro over the children and myself, and the children are attending counselling. However the process of dealing with civil, family and criminal matters has been extraordinarily difficult and impossible to navigate with excess court dates. I have a new job, and support all 6 children as my ex husband is choosing to remain unemployed into settlement. The police have been less then empathetic and obviously have limited to no training in complex and severe DV which involves financial, psychological, physical and continued stalking and behaviours that have been highlighted in family court. However the police have deterred us from pursuing assault, or any other family violence charges. Including my eldest son to whom is now 19 at the time 16. From pressing assault charges by the local police . We have a DCP risk assessment that places myself and the children at high risk from the father. We have expert witness reports (forensic psychologist). When provided to the police to prove intent for stalking and intimidation, the police refused to view them to build a case for further charges. We complained to the ccc. To whom have now responded telling me that I will have the police review the documents and potentially change there decision not to charge him. However I don’t feel confident that they will revise their decisions, and we are simply being followed up because of the complaint. The language of the police officers has been as such. Why didn’t you call us when it was happening, why didn’t you present to Ed more often, why didn’t you leave him. Yet disregarded all evidence produced in family court in his admittance to stopping me from leaving or calling the police.

PTSD-1507,Can’t control my anger,"More and more, I’m seeing myself losing control in anger. Saying nasty things, yelling, unable to calm myself down. I can’t let go of things - I can think about something that happened when I was a kid (20 years ago) and feel painful anger as if it happened five minutes ago. This week I haven’t felt happy - just angry. I have been picking fights with my boyfriend over tiny or ancient things. Our relationship has not been stable for a long time and there are times that I wonder whether some of his behaviour is emotionally/psychologically abusive. I’m not trying to excuse my behaviour - I’m including this just to give context. He insults me a lot, talks over me, puts words in my mouth, dismisses me. But when I think about us breaking up, I become extremely distressed. I don’t get it! I know I could be happier than I am but I feel panicked and distressed when he says he’s leaving. I’m in my mid-30’s - this isn’t how I pictured my myself or my life! I think I give as good as I get with him and was told by his mother earlier this year that my behaviour “shocked” her. She said I’m incredibly needy, self centered and attention seeking. She saw him yell at me and said I pushed him to that point of anger. That doesn’t feel right - that I’m responsible for his behaviour - but maybe I’m letting myself off too easily? My behaviour can be terrible and there are so many things I regret. Angry accusations said in front of his kids. She told him and she has barely spoken to me since. That’s fair enough. I’m not sure what to do to repair the relationships with his family... he says they’re all over it by now but I can’t let it go. How could I? I’m mortified by my own behaviour. And even that hasn’t stopped me. I keep losing my temper and behaving terribly. Little things just seem to hurt so much and I don’t know how to let things go I lost my temper with my sister this week when I felt that she was unfairly attacking me. I apologised the next day but I sensed that some permanent damage has been done. For more context, for 6 years I’ve have anxiety and agoraphobia, triggered by trauma. I don’t want to be like this and I don’t know how to repair the damage I’ve caused to relationships. I’ve been given a lot of chances and keep blowing them. Please help. I wish I could rewind a lot of my life and do it again.

PTSD-1508,Recovering from an abusive religious cult,"So this may be a strange issue, but I've felt like putting it into words in a place where I can get some advice maybe. My family and I have left a spiritually abusive church, which had all the signs of a cult. It's kind of difficult to describe, because it's a very under reported thing, and I don't want to get all religious on you, but it left us with some pretty bad issues. It's not due to any one event, but rather a culmination of lots of little things over the years that slowly crushed us. When we left, we felt like we were literally fleeing. We lived in this isolated bubble for almost 15 years, with no real contact with any other people except for normal day-to-day happenings at the shops, etc. That was basically it. We lived together, we homeschooled and we all worked in this ""family"" run business. I won't even get started on the illegal practices that went on there. All of my friends except for one, who lives interstate, were in that church, and now they are gone. They have nothing to do with us, like they don't even acknowledge us as we pass them in the shopping centre, even though we spent our lives with them. I never learnt how to make friends because there weren't any friends to make. No one came, and the people that did leave we were told to shun. Now I literally feel like an alien from another planet. I'm in this position where churches or anything remotely related to God are terrifying places for me. The symptoms are basically PTSD. To compound that, I've lost all of my friends. My closest friend lives interstate, and I'm pretty close with my sisters, but that's it. I am too scared to make any because not only am I hugely introverted, but this whole thing has left me with what must be social anxiety. Because I had to work in the aforementioned business from a young age, like 14, I was forced to grow up really quickly and now I don't relate to people my age at all because we have nothing in common. I haven't done anything they have or experienced anything ""normal"" teenagers would have.

PTSD-1509,Recently diagnosed with PTSD,"Hi there, I'm new to the forums so hello! I was diagnosed with PTSD about a month ago and things are hard. I don't feel any better now that there is a label on it but I'm recovering. I went looking for help just before I was diagnosed so I'm also new to therapy. I spoke to my friends briefly about seeing a therapist and being diagnosed but I don't think they understand what PTSD is and what it means to know somebody with PTSD. When I first told them, I got the response from one of them ""Oh what from?"" and it really made me uncomfortable. Should I have to justify my illness? I feel like they see it as invalid unless I tell them about my trauma.",BeebeeG,Community Member,31-08-2018,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/recently-diagnosed-with-ptsd/td-p/366365
PTSD-1510,Lost and depressed.,"Hi there, never done this before so please bear with me. i have battled depression ever since I was 13 (I’m 22) when my parents marriage blew up. When I was 18 I was diagnosed with anxiety. When I was 20 I fell in love with a man I’ve been with for almost 3 years and over all just became generally happier in all aspects. I should mention that I began a Nursing degree at the university back in 2014. And through many ups and downs I am still completeing it to this date. Nursing was something that I fell in love with when I first visited the uni, I was instantly drawn to it and once I began the degree I had a burning passion for it day in and day out. I loved every placement I went on, even when it was stressful and overwhelming I still felt so passionate about knowing it was exactly what I was meant to be doing in life. Last year before Christmas I was raped. A man assaulted me in my own bed and I’ve never been the same. My family knows & have all been very supportive. My roommate/best friend knows, the only person who doesn’t know is my partner. I have my reasons for not telling him and it’s not something I wish to discuss at this time. Since going back to uni to complete my final semester, I have felt lost. I don’t feel the happiness I used to feel about nursing. When I went to my final placement, I experienced heavy anxiety, panic attacks and fainting spells. I explained my situation to the head of the department, she was very nice and supporting and she told me to try come back in a months time and repeat the placement. So I gratefully did. My first day back my anxiety was so high & my brain was a foggy mess. My facilitator sat me down and asked me if felt ready to become a nurse at the end of the year and I broke down. I had been feeling so lost and disconnected for so many months but it was the first time someone had asked me that. I have a lot of pressure from my dad to finish uni. Being that I was merely a couple of months away from finally finishing i know he is not gonna react nicely when I tell him I’m gonna repeat it next year and therefore won’t be graduating til next year. I’m terrified to tell my dad. I shouldn’t be, I’m 22 and it’s up to me what I do. But I am terrified. I also feel very depressed. I feel like I’ve lost who I am, I feel like I’m also a failure and a disappointment.",Tres,Community Member,28-08-2018,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/lost-and-depressed/td-p/361726
PTSD-1511,My mum knew- and did nothing. *Trigger Warning: Child Abuse* ,"When I was roughly 8-9 years old, my grandfather was over at our house all the time. My parents left me alone with him- not knowing what a nutcase the man was. I was continuously molested throughout my childhood. It would happen every time he was over. I told mum and she believed me, but she wouldn't tell me dad (as it was HIS dad molesting me). I grew up in an abusive home, my mum was too scared to tell- and so I suppose I suffered for it? Eventually she tried to keep me away from him, I was little and I didn't quite understand just how serious the situation was. It didnt work. It kept happening. I am now 27 years old, and the older I get, the angrier and sadder I get. I grew up being too exposed to sex and sexual encounters- we lived in a house that was NOT sound proof. As an adult, I am now disgusted at anything to do with sex. I get flash blacks of my childhood- of times when I was inappropriately touched, physically assaulted by my mother, and yelled and screamed at by my dad. I cant help but be angry with them, even at my age. I am so saddened by my family's behaviour towards me.

PTSD-1513,I'm trying to reach the surface but I keep being pulled under.,"Everything hurts, I didn't realise emotional pain could feel so excruciatingly physically painful. My chest hurts, my head hurts, my eyes hurt. A number of months ago I finally escaped the cycle of a protracted year long breakup with a man who told me everyday he loved me while controlling and abusing me. He still tries to contact me despite being blocked on facebook, phone, and email. I was reduced to an emotional wreck and felt like a shell of the bubbly, passionate person I was three years ago before all of the mess happened. Recently I started seeing another man. It took so much courage to do it because my heart was still so fragmented. He has been kind, caring, generous and thoughtful. He knows that I am struggling from the break up and was ok to take things slowly. Yesterday we slept together, he met my family and I finally opened up and shared about the trauma of my past relationship. Because of the sexual abuse I had experienced, sleeping with him bought up the most heart gripping anxiety and afterwards I sobbed into his chest. I know it wasn't fair but I couldn't keep the hurt inside. Last night we spoke and I told him I wasn't ready to keep sleeping with him. He was fine with that but told me that all of this changed things, he was ok with me asking to not sleep together but didn't want to be a rebound. I know that, I understand, and maybe I have used him to help me heal from the difficult relationship I have had. In saying that, I can see myself in long term relationship with him and I guess I didn't realise how awful my past relationship was until I experienced the kindness and respect he has shown me. He doesn't want to continue the relationship and I am left raw and so incredibly exposed. I feel like I've made myself so vulnerable to him by sleeping with him and sharing so deeply that the rejection is so painful I feel like I'm drowning. I don't know what to do. I didn't sleep last night and I don't know how much pain I can experience without breaking down completely.",El_Mar,Community Member,19-08-2018,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-m-trying-to-reach-the-surface-but-i-keep-being-pulled-under/td-p/421617

PTSD-1515,"Scared, anxious, depressed, body failing. (trigger warning domestic abuse)","Hi all. 32 yrd F, divorced, no kids. Suffered anxiety since I could remember. I was bullied severely by many kids from prep to grade 7 which is when I quit school. My parents got divorced during that time and I was assaulted by my new step brother. My father blamed me. I was then housebound for 5 years with severe anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder and agoraphobia. I had a surgery which caused massive haemorrgage when I was alone at home recovering, and I nearly died. I then lived in a psychiatric unit for a while due to severe anxiety (permanent panic state that didn't ease for weeks). I had a couple of older boyfriends from age 13-15 who used me sexually then left. Then I started a relationship with my ex husband at 15 and he was 21. We met online and he eventually moved to Australia and we got married when I was 20. He was ok at first but down the track, he would call me names, laughed when I cried, hit and pushed me etc. He wouldn't work and I had to work really hard in a physical job to support us both. I was also doing a degree so I was busy/stressed, I cried every night for years. He would not do housework, I did everything. He started drinking heavy and doing drugs. That's when I started drinking too. That went on for 8 years of ""marriage"". I had to throw out most of my belongings/furniture and moved into a small bedroom in a relative's house. My ex came with me as I was still too weak to get rid of him. The violence got worse and he'd abuse me in the middle of the night. Then finally I kicked him out. I then started another relationship with a long term friend 2.5 years ago, slowly, with extreme caution, and miraculously it became my first healthy relationship. He's truly the love of my life, an amazing man. I had a bout of stress recently with having to leave a job I was at for 8 years, dog died, health scares etc. But life started to settle down now and I was feeling better but still binge drinking. I started cutting back and was feeling better, but then went on a bender and felt awful after. I decided to fully stop, figured I'd start feeling better as usual, but I'm just not. It's been 2 weeks and I'm still so dizzy that it's hard to walk, stumbling, severe fatigue where I stay in bed whenever I'm not at work, high blood pressure, chest tightness. It's hard to function.

PTSD-1516,Narcisstic mother & Absent father Daily Emotional Abuse as a Child,"It has only occurred to me very recently the depth of the trauma I have experienced. I can barely navigate through the complex sadness & feelings. I am in my early 50's. Emotional abuse as bad as it can be. My mother is the most manipulative and cruelest person I know. She has isolated all her 4 adult children and trashed every one of us to anyone who will listen. We are estranged from each other and other family. I just need somewhere public to vent this. To read the words and on some level validate this for me. I struggle with every close relationship driven myself hard to carve out a very successful career. I have had a family-two adult children, I have a marriage and possibly from the outside look 'normal'. Inside I am hurt and every bit an abused child. I feel so lacking in the skills and everyday relationship require. I am self doubt, anxiety, depression on anti-depressants & very lonely. I struggle to have close friends and I have issues with intimacy. Despite being the peacemaker, the organiser, the helper, the court jester and anything else required of me I have always been the greatest disappointment to my mother. I grew up with judgement, hatred, spite, raw emotion, jealously and constant need being placed upon me. I don't talk to my mother anymore. Its been 12 months. She is in her late 70's and as she has gotten older has become more vicious and devious. My father died 20 years ago and despite her claiming he ruined her life since his death her life has got worse and unraveled into something so feral and nasty I miss having a relationship with a parent, with my mother more than anything. My childhood has left me with deep deficits. As the oldest child of 4 I very quickly became the abandoned pet when the other children were born and nothing has ever been good enough, valuable enough ever to capture her attention. I have no concept that a woman who claims to value family above all else has destroyed it and destroyed individuals as much as she possibly could to maintain control.I feel like I have no support. No one has my back. No one loves me with such fierce unconditional love (like a parent should) that I am important. I feel alone, lonely, sad, damaged and closed off. My memories are all yelling, screaming, gutter language, abuse, household items being thrown across rooms and hatred. I have no memories of love, acceptance, fun or understanding.

Aus day 2013 get caught in Bundaberg floods and loose what was left of our belongings inc our eldest daughters photos school books etc Spend 4 yrs blaming each other for our daughter being killed in a toxic marriage Left Qld with my youngest daughter move to get away from her violent mother early 2017. My wife spoke twice to my self and my daughter in 12 mths to selfish to care generally about her daughter. Early 2018 my wife seems to be improving we start to have regular conversation by phone but my daughter still refuses to talk to her. July 2018 my wife was killed in a motorbike crash. Mother in law lied to coroner gets the body and cremated it with out my daughter being aloud to go. Mother in law is trying to get my daughter's inheritance. I'm done fighting life.

PTSD-1519,My life is falling apart,"No matter where I turn, or what I do, I fail. My whole life has been like that, and it's not getting any better and I am beginning to doubt it ever will. My first marriage failed. The only good thing my four children. I have no contact with my sons, I am an embarrassment to them. I cannot change their attitude no matter what I say or do. I phone, they refuse to answer, email and even the old fashioned post, letters come back unopened. Its killing me slowly. My relationship with my eldest daughter is strained as I do not get on with her second husband, I have tried, but my tongue but then I called him out on his attitude to one on my grandchildren, his step son, well it went downhill from there, she calls it when hes not around. My youngest daughter tries, she has two young boys, both are special needs. My ex husband I wont discuss, we grew apart and I left him. my second husband died in 2015, suddenly and unexpected. He left me with debts i had to sell the house to pay off, i had no idea. lately I have secured a rental property, ready to move this week end. Ha ha!!! It should have been exciting, but I cannot get my furniture from storage as I cannot pay them. If I get it delivered I can sell the shipping container and such a lot of the contents, this will cover most of the money owed, but they wont sgree and have said they will sell my things. I told them my husband and parents ashes are in there as well as sentimental items, photos and all my documents which could allow someone to steal my identity, but they still wont agree. Another fail, by me. Everything from my childhood on, I was abused by two people, one a friend of my parents he is dead, I only hope he is rotting in hell. The other a family member who was a policeman in Vic and while denying it said the police won't do anything if I report as he was one of them, protect their own. So another fail on my part, I have to live with it. I have no contact with my siblings, my parents died while living with me, they were 87 and 89 and i didnt do enough. Fail. My late husbands children blame me for his death even it was a heart attack. Fail. I tried suicide 3 times. Fail. Car broken down, cant fix it. Fail Was assaulted, a police matter, my fault for going out to see why dog was barking. Fail. And I question my mental health and if it's all worth it. I take my meds religiously but wonder why.

PTSD-1521,TRIGGER WARNING abortion and guilt,"TRIGGER ⚠ Almost 2 years ago I had an unplanned pregnancy and termination. A result of my complacency. I didn't have periods and have polycystic ovaries. I hadn't been able to use hormonal contraception for 2 years at the time due to a neurological issue, we were using other methods of contraception but obviously weren't always consistant, I didn't even think I could fall pregnant. I had just started, and still am, taking lamotrigine, which can cause birth defects (although it seems it's the least likely of the anticonvulsants to do so, if anyone has any personal experience taking lamotrigine during pregnancy I would be very interested to hear from you!). My GP supported the termination due to the risk the lamotrigine posed, and as a result of my mental state at the time. I'm not sure I made the right decision. I'm 28 now, I think I want to have children but I'm so scared. Scared of possibly coming off my medications, of their side effects if not. Scared of my ability to cope with the stress, which sets off mood episodes. Scared of regretting a decision I can't revoke (this sounds like a horrible thing to say but it's a very real fear of mine). My brother just announced he and his partner are having a baby, the first thing I felt was jealously? All I can think is that I won't be able to fall pregnant again, that I will be punished for what I've done, that it was actually the one chance I was going to have to be a mum and now I never will. I'm happy for him but I'm also deeply jealous, I cant seem focus my attention on them and not my own issues. My mum doesn't even know about my pregnancy or termination, so she's talking about her soon to be grand baby non stop and I'm struggling to maintain a happy face.

PTSD-1523,I think he's been cheating n I'm so confused *Trigger warning - domestic abuse*,So i have always trusted my husband of 7 years although there have been times I've caught him with little white lies I always let it go coz I thought he was basically honest. Throughout our relationship he frequently stays out over night- we live in a rural area so I say if u had a drink please don't drive. Or he claims he too tired to drive if he working quite a distance from home. In December he was supposed to be coming home from our nearest town-only 25 mins away. He then disappeared all night n his phone was off. I was at home with our 6 week old baby. Very frightened n upset I txt several of friends but none had heard from him. When he finally responded to me he claimed to b in a town an hour away n had got drunk with an old mate(someone I've met but have no contact with) he then said too drunk to drive home n was sleeping in his ute. I thought strange if he with his mate why not sleep on his lounge? following this he complained about burning when urinating I said prob an infection from too much beer. I will admit I was quite involved with being a new mum so didn't really pay as much attention as I should of. We had resumed our sex life but then on Feb I noticed things down below were a bit off n went to the Drs. I was diagnosed with gonorrea. I confronted him n he said no way had he cheated it must b a wrong diagnoses. I told him to go get the shots anyway coz if I had it he would have it. So he went Drs but apparently had clymidia??? I decided to let this go as it was too confusing n I wanted our marriage to work for the sake of our son. Anyway just recently we had to get print out of old bank statements ( we have separate accounts) n I offered to help him highlight n look for the items we were looking for in them but he got mad n hid them from me. Again I let it go. Then yesterday the statements were in my car where they got left after the appointment we needed them for n he went mad at me as to why I had them n had I looked at them. I hadn't looked but after he went out I went through them n found payments dating back to 2015 at various motels within our area. Now I have no idea what to do. My family all live overseas n I have very few friends. When we have been fighting previously he has told me I will never ever be able to take his son- he scares me. He has a violent temper n recently physically abused me in temper. He calls me names but says I make him do it coz I nag.

PTSD-1524,Abused at hospital,"Unfortunately, my story is one where I was traumatised because I was taken to a major Sydney hospital and when I discovered I’d been “sectioned” (god I hate their shorthand) I asked repeatedly why and I got placed into the seclusion room for 5.5 hours. In that time I had no assessments, didn’t get to go to the toilet and was humiliated in front of the full hospital who were watching me. to make things worse, the hospital’s GM repeatedly lied about the situation and claimed I was not in seclusion but was in a “dual purpose facility”. There’s a lot more, but the upshot is that I fought hard ask st the system and they have now admitted I was abused, and both the HCCC and the Local Health District has apologised to me. The issue I now have is I have a complete lack of trust in virtually all health professionals. I am incredibly angry with the way I’ve been treated, and I feel isolated from family and friends. I used to regularly attend church, but I can’t any more. I can’t go round to family events, I don’t go to social events except with very close friends, I do t like leaving the house on weekends and I don’t spend enough time with my beautiful children or my wife. I basically feel ashamed of how I have reacted, feel stigmatised by the health system, disrespected and feared even though I’m actually a very gentle person. At the same time my sense of indignity and the fact that I was blamed and ignored for three years has made me pursue this - probably to my detriment. Because there were three years where I was largely ignored and disbelieved, I have sent heaps of letters and emails to a variety of people. I haven’t had much of a choice really as until recently I was utterly ignored by the hospital (well, not just ignored but actively lied to - I writing actually), the HCCC, a private medical facility where they did very little to help me, and was told by my psychiatrist to just accept injustice. I’m not sleeping well, my mind is constantly ruminating on what happened to me, I feel equal measures fear but oddly I also feel angry and fearlessly confrontational. I have read of PTSD symptoms and I honestly think my “off switch” is broken and my anxiety has been set to 11. I woukd like like to go back to feeling like my old self, regain my dignity and be able to put the whole thing behind me but I am incapable of doing this.

PTSD-1525,"Witnessed an assault, cant stop thinking about it now","**Trigger Warning, there is talk of an event some may find disturbing** A couple of days ago my partner whom I love dearly was aggressively physically assaulted by an unknown person. The attack was random and uncalled for, it left my partner with a broken nose and minor head injuries. When it happened, i remained calm and attended to the situation to the best of my ability. My brain kind of blocked out all the blood and everything that I saw so that i could focus on breaking the fight up, gathering evidence and ensuring my partner was okay. Its been a few days now and ive been looking after him making sure his okay whilst his injuries heal. People were saying to me they were surprised how calm i was during the whole thing and how i must have been so scared. All i can say is honestly in the moment I wasnt scared at all but now, a few days later I cant stop thinking about it. When i close my eyes I see the person who assaulted my partner face. I keep replaying the blood i saw gushing out over and over again. I remember how much pain my partner was in as we waited for the ambulance and the shocked faces of everyone around me whilst my partner was on the floor. I just want it out of my mind.

PTSD-1526,Boyfriend hit me after I hit him.,"my boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 2 years now and we have a lot going on being in year 12 and trying to both keep a balance between school and life as well as our relationship. we never used to fight as much as we do now and it’s got me really worried. things just set us off. he’s really good with his words and sometimes he pushes it too far and his words become extremely hurtful; to the point where it upsets me and makes me lose all confidence and self esteem within myself. he knows to be gentle and kind to me as I do suffer from anxiety and depression but I don’t know if he realises whether he is doing something to hurt me or not. in saying this, I lose all self control of myself considering he’s the only friend/person who’s ever been there for me.

I then retaliate and push him and then he’ll say something like “go on do it again” or “is it fun pushing me around like that?” and then i will push him some more.

PTSD-1527,Scared of trauma therapy,"Hello, I've started trauma therapy and I am scared. I have only fragmented memories of my childhood abuse and I feel so dirty and worthless thinking about it. How could I get sexually abused for years from different people? Why did it happen? Why can I remember so little of my past? There are many questions for my therapists, but I would like to know from other survivors, how do you deal with the flashbacks? The times when you feel like you're 5 years old again? When you just want to die because you don't want to remember? When you feel worthless and useless and a waste of space? I feel like there are two people in me and I have no control when I get upset. How can I get myself grounded? I've learnt grounding techniques but when I feel bad I feel I don't deserve to feel better and I don't use them?

PTSD-1529,Need to talk and for someone to listen,"4 months ago I finally acknowledged the sexual abuse I recieved at the hands of both my brothers, calling it for what it is. The strange thing is, I don't recall the ongoing abuse by 1 of them. I only know this because he came to me 12 yrs ago to ask for forgiveness. I did, only because I wasn't ready to talk. Internally, Things fell into place, for instance, who I had lost my virginity to. This is a big one, especially for a woman. But I am ready now. This brother (1) has been an incredible support and allows me to ask many awkward questions. He does feel guilt and shame. It started at 7. He would have been 11. My other brother started when I was 13 it occurred twice. He would have been 16. My 2nd brother denies it happened. I did chat to him to try to get answers, to forgive him for my sake. It's complex because despite this, I looked up to both of them and love them. I was also physically abused by my grandfather and bullied throughout school. My father was a verbally abusive alcoholic. I need to air this as I can't be open with it because (I hate to say) of the consequences for my brothers and my family. I know I didn't grow up in a safe environment as I was repeatedly exposed to my abusers. But airing this would devastate my mum as she tried her best to keep the family together. I internalised all my pain. Even to the point of blacking it out of my memory. i was diagnosed with depression as a teen, tried suicide multiple times. The counsellor I had back then never dug deep enough to expose the abuse then. All we discussed was the school bullies. I never did heal and now suffer with fibromyalgia. Years later (I'm 32) and After months of treatment, I'm still finding it hard to find a way to put this trauma to bed. My psychologist tells me I need to find a way to move on but I don't know where to start. I would appreciate some advice and direction. i am new here and I'll research the other threads too. But I'm desperate to tell my story and I thank you for reading",Quinn_tm,Community Member,25-07-2018,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/need-to-talk-and-for-someone-to-listen/td-p/381596
PTSD-1530,Coping With a Touch Phobia,"Okay so I have a phobia of people touching me, this phobia is the result of living with an abusive parent when I was a child. The way my touch phobia works is that I cannot stand it when people touch me I feel scared and (this sounds very dramatic) violated. I also struggle to be able to touch other people so I avoid any and all physical contact and intimacy. The problem is that not everyone who goes in for a hug or handshake knows this and even though it's hard I push through it is physically trying for me and sometimes it takes hours for me to feel safe again. I don't want to say no and give them no reason as to why because i'm probably going to offend them and ruin alot of relationships, but I don't want to tell everyone I meet about this phobia or the fact that I had an abusive parent. Is there some way to work around this?.

I hide bottles and my son and partner are obviously worried. They want me to attend AA. I tried to find support groups for PTSD but can only find online support, not actual face to face support groups. There is lots of Anxiety meetings but most don't deal with PTSD. I am Bi Polar. You can see why the drinking needs to stop. The PTSD triggered multiple trauma I experienced under the age of 5.

PTSD-1536,Reliving trauma from sexual abuse,"Hi everyone, this is my first post so sorry if I break any rules, but I’m recently having quite a hard time dealing with thoughts about my sexual assaults from my past. With lots of people becoming more open about talking about sexual assault, it seems to be bringing up the memories more often. The first time I was raped was 8 years ago when I was 18 by my best friends much older boyfriend, and it was a complicated situation where I was blamed and received large amounts of abuse for it. I lost frienfs, and it was a hugely traumatising experience for me. Back then I was from a small town and the people around me didn’t understand that I was raped, they blamed me and said it was my fault. I dealt with it but it creeps up on me now and again. I’m usually good at dealing with my thoughts and getting on with life but recently I’ve been really struggling to stop thinking about it. My partner, the love of my life, is away on a work trip so I’m spending a lot of time alone and I’ve come to realise how much I repress my thoughts when I am with him as I only begin to feel like this when I’m alone and have time to think. Is this normal? When I’m with him I barely think about it. But now I’m alone it’s terrorizing me. But I never talk with him about it, he knows I have been sexually assaulted before but he doesn’t know any details, although the most recent assault happened while I was with him (I was assaulted by his boss’ wife at a party while I was black out drunk) and it was one of the only times we’ve ever argued, because he was trying to work out if he believed it was an actual assault or if it was consensual. Since then we haven’t spoken about it, and I see my abuser on a regular basis. It still hurts but I try not to think about it. Today I was triggered by a friends facebook post, where she was openly describing what happened to her when she was also sexually assaulted, and since then I’ve been going over and over both of the times it happened to me. I feel like I need help in managing my thoughts when im alone, because it seems that when my partner is around I am distracted and don’t give myself enough time to deal with my thoughts. I’m not sure if I’m just putting a block on my thoughts, or if him bring around helps me deal with it. I just don’t know. if he was here I wouldn’t be having these thoughts, but i had to get this off my chest and see if anyone else has some insight.",Abrasumente,Community Member,14-07-2018,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/reliving-trauma-from-sexual-abuse/td-p/367161

PTSD-1540,Supporting family through domestic abuse,"This is my first time posting to a forum. I need support with a family abuse issue. My Dad had always had a temper and is a demanding man. Over the past year my Mum has been telling me she isn't happy, feels scared and wants Dad to leave. She said he is being controlling with money, yet buys whatever he wants. He has also tried hurting my sister a couple of times. Or goes days without acknowledging her. My sister is an adult but she has an illness and lives at home with Mum caring for her. About two months ago my sister texted to say Dad walked out. Then he started being difficult saying he was going to sell the house. Even had people to come out to have a look. I told Mum not to sign anything. And he tried to take money from the bank too. Dad was telling everyone Mum kicked him out. Then he gives her a sob story saying it's all her fault because she didn't tell him she was scared of him. And that he is now homeless and sleeping on the ground. So she lets him come back home. Now this upsets my sister, so Mum asks if she can stay with me for a little bit, because Mum said she is having a breakdown and can't cope. My Mum still visits my sister and my place every couple of days and cooks for her while I'm away at work. I also think she does this to avoid Dad. I think my sister being out of the unsafe place has made Mum back off though. She has never been independent, never worked and is too scared. But since my sister is safe from Dad she chooses to stay. However I don't want my sister living with me all the time because I find it draining. She never helps out with the house, always saying her illness makes her too tired. And my place is small. It's feeling too crowed and messy. I know she is safe at mine and I feel terrible because I don't want to live with her. We clash sometimes because we are very different. Ita starting to make me feel down.

PTSD-1541,New psychologist......,"Hi all Everyone welcome to have their input. This week I'm off to see a new psychologist. My previous one retired and I've been trying to find a new one. The last two were pretty average and didn't help me at all in what I needed, i.e. to get through episodes of PTSD, anxiety and depression. So, how am I feeling? While I've been waiting for my appointment, I've become very active in writing in BB. This has helped me to realise how - NOT ALONE I am. While it's not good for those of you who are experiencing these episodes, I do take comfort that help is at hand. So, what am I afraid of? That I have to retell, relive, re-experience my trauma(s). Yuk, oh yuk. However!! When I started with my last (good) psychologist, she did not need me to retell, relive, re-experience my trauma. It was good enough for her that I had already opened up everything and explored all the hidden secrets with the previous psych! So it was easy for us to move on to 'identifying those things I was currently experience', 'what processes I needed to put in place to move on', 'get in touch with my inner child and give her the comfort she'd never had'. So, what does this Thursday have install for me..... Hopefully, if he's worth his weight in gold, i'll not need to open up the scabs that have closed and healed. That we'll move on to how to proceed being retired, no longer working, suffering bouts of PTSD, anxiety and depression. So keep your fingers crossed for me.... Will let you know how I go (BTW, my GP says he's very good ) Here's hoping!! Kind regards PR",PamelaR,Blue Voices Member,05-02-2018,PTSD and trauma,65,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/new-psychologist/td-p/421161

PTSD-1544,My Abuser is Getting Married to a Friend,"Hi everyone, So this is my first post so I hope it’s okay. Thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my post, I could really use your help! So I was sexually assulted by someone who I considered to be one of my closest friends when I was at university. The kicker: He was my best friends boyfriend. I have been physically, sexually, and mentally abused by past boyfriends and he used my PTSD and fear to overpower me. I never told my friend about what happened between her boyfriend and I. I simply withdrew from the friendship, mainly because I felt ashamed for what happened. I felt like I betrayed her and our friendship, even though I was forced into it. I felt so awful, I couldn’t even look at her in the face. With that being said, I have always been afraid that if he could do something like that to me, not under the influence of anything, what could he do to her? I have always wanted to tell her what happened, but have never had the courage to...She always thought I was jealous of her and her relationship so I honestly don’t think she would have believe me if I did. We have since lost touch, but social media just announced she and my abuser are now engaged. When I saw this, my entire body went limp. I completely regressed into the fear that she is marrying and spending the rest of her life with a monster. I don’t know if I should tell her or just leave it. I am afraid it is too late as this was a few years ago and we haven’t spoken in over a year, but I feel like she has the right to know. I just feel like it is too late. I am so lost and so confused.

PTSD-1546,"Pregnant, suffering with PTSD and partner continually sides with his family over me","My partner and I have been together for over 2 and a half years, 10 years ago I was sexually assaulted by a family friends child, about a year ago it started taking a tole my outbursts and depression really bought a wedge between us, so I finally told him what I had been keeping as a secret for the last decade, was diagnosed with PTSD, began seeing a councillor and was put on medication. Things were back on track except for my partner is extremely close with his family to the point were it was unhealthy, he would do anything to please his mother even if it meant making issues in other parts of his life. He has always lived at home, since we started dating he has been told by his mother he can't go out and see me because she thought we needed a break, that we need to break up because she believes he can do better, when she found out I was going to counselling she said to him that he was young and still had a life ahead of him why would he want to waste it with someone who was messed up. Any time we have tried to move on with our life as a couple such as living out of my wage and saving all of his, moving out, going on holidays, she has told him no and he bails at the last second. She has called me a gold digger, hurtful names, ignored me. Now after over 2 years of bad behaviour from her I am pregnant (4 months along) and we were waiting to get our own place before telling them but he freaked out and got scared to move out, he was terrified they would be upset with him and told his parents he was thinking of moving out and when asked why he would do that he panicked and said that I was pregnant. Now they want to be involved with everything, he wants me to forget everything she's said and one to me and I'm not comfortable with that.

PTSD-1553,Lost and confused,"Hello, A year into my journey to seek help I feel as lost and confused or more than when I started this. I know there was a trigger event at the beginning of the week, but I feel helpless to stop the helplessness. I want to do things that make me feel better, but I also just want to hide. I've seen my psych yesterday and I don't think it has helped. Just as I thought I had a bit of clarity and a goal to focus on, the playing field has changed once again. I'm just so tired of it. I like rules and I like to focus on goals, and in this game there are no rules, my back up team (meds) is a big trial and error, the ref (doc and psych) don't know which game I'm playing and confuse me when they have a guess, then we have time out and during this the game changes - so with my studs I run on ice all of the sudden. I will as every day, keep some of my routine up, I don't give in that easy. Will it ever get any easier? What can I do to make me understand that there is no game plan? How did you break through the confusion?",Guest_2350,Community Member,23-03-2016,PTSD and trauma,62,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/lost-and-confused/td-p/127281
PTSD-1554,Post Car Accident Anxiety/Trauma - Normal Feelings or Consider Seeking Help?,"In mid-April of this year I was involved in a serious car accident in which my car was t-boned. My passenger was uninjured but I suffered multiple serious injuries, plus suffered from nerve damage in my lower leg. I also have very little memory of the accident but remember every small detail in the lead up. I have continuously been told how lucky I am, how emergency services expected me to be dead from first look at the car, and how close I was to having a majorly different outcome - possibly a broken spine or fatality. My partner has also spoken frequently about how he initially thought I was dead for a second and how he assumed I wouldn't be able to walk again. He and my family have been really protective of me since, making sure I'm being super cautious and that I'm not going to do anything that could risk a fall or make my injuries worse. Initially I knew I was extremely lucky and felt the need to live without holding back as you never know how long you have, but since then I have found myself carefully considering the possible outcomes of everything. Prior to the accident I had been pretty fearless. I am usually quite active, love going on adventures and trying new things. I've gone skydiving in past with no hesitation and loved every second of it, telling myself that one day I will do it again, yet now even just looking at photos of those times that I loved makes me feel anxious - my heart rate speeds up a bit and I begin to feel nauseous. I can't even begin to imagine doing any of these things again and often find myself thinking about all the things I have spent years wanting to do in the future that I now wouldn’t even consider doing as a result. I'm currently unable to walk much due to the pelvis injuries but am very slowly getting back to an everyday routine. My doctors have told me this fear is normal and nothing to worry about as it will pass when I am able to get out and about again. I worry that this is something that won't just disappear as it's making me question everything I've done in past and everything I've wanted to do in future. Has anyone had any similar experiences? Is this something has just gone away? Or is this something to consider speaking to someone about sooner rather than later?",Buttercup363,Community Member,13-06-2018,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/post-car-accident-anxiety-trauma-normal-feelings-or-consider/td-p/393074
PTSD-1555,Being in a relationship where it use to be abuseive,"Hi I have no one to talk to about this. but I have been in a relationship with this man where it’s was abusive.

I have a 6 year old daughter aswell, and I have let him back in her life, but I feel like a bad mum to put her through that again. He had gotten help and is doing Counselling sessions and I see the changes. but my whole family is worried for me, and Specially for my daughter.

PTSD-1556,Partner with PTSD - Chronic Disorganisation HELP,"I live in the Hills District NSW with my partner who currently suffers Chronic PTSD & ADHD. He is on workers compensation at the moment, and is not working. He's family kicked him out of his home as their culture doesn't believe in mental illness, and refused to support him. I rented a house for us so I could take care of him, however just after we moved in, he began impulsive buying and chronic disorganisation & messiness. I hear this is typical for people with mental injuries. He has a regular Psychologist & Psychiatrist but they don't address this issue. We've only been in the house 4 months and the problem is far too big for me to tackle on my own. Once I can clean an area, I come home to find it is back to how it was. I spend what few hours I have after work and my weekends off just cleaning and trying to support his mood swings, make sure he's eating and showering, and try to get him out of the house, only for it all to be undone once I'm back at work. I'm worried we may lose our house come inspection time, as I have nobody to help, I work full time in the CBD with 12hr working days & 2hrs travel time and we cannot afford professional cleaners for the time we would need them. I'm worried even if we did, it may not stay that way for long. I'm told insurance is to pay for cleaning and organising support for people on workers compensation for a mental injury, however his insurance company are being incredibly difficult. They've threatened several times to cut him off. We really need help, but we just can't afford the resources available. Does anybody know if there is a charity group or government assistance program that helps with such matters?

PTSD-1557,"Newbie.... hello, and ....stuff.","Hi everyone, I am new here, and just wanted to say hello. I had a huge and very frightening awakening last week...... which has led me here. I have read so much this last week, and it is just so unbelievable that I have been living like this so long (i'm 37 and referring to sustained physical and emotional abuse as a child). I realise now I have become adept at avoidance: life, people, rationalising/normalising my behaviour. What i'm dealing with - it ""looks"" like PTSD. Complex PTSD. I thought only soldiers experienced this, let alone different types! I have a whole new perspective. Tomorrow I see the GP, get a referral or something. I honestly don't know what I am doing. I have found a psychologist, but the thought makes my hands shake & I want to vomit. The fear is out of control (traumatic experience in childhood with court appointed ""counsellors"" and so-called ""confidentiality"". Subsequently things I had said in my sessions were read out, to a courtroom full of people (including my parents) - which led to further abuse, that then led to me being removed from the home. I was placed in some backwater half-way house where I was treated like a criminal, and kept away from the other children, as if I was responsible for the violence. Then I was placed back in my parents home for more). I guess trust issues are a big thing, those people said they would help me. I'll admit, the idea of having an actual diagnoses is validating for me, for the first time that a) I am worthy of help, b) what happened to me was real and terrible, c) it is not my fault and d) there is hope. I guess I am looking for more than a polite introduction, i'm trying to reach out to connect to others who know what this feels like. This is the first time I have had the courage to look back, to do something about this. I am so isolated. I am scared. I have got rid of everything and everyone that reminds me of that time in my life. So many things triggers me. I can't get hot without feeling like I am suffocating. Loud noises. Lights. Smells. Words. Forks. I didn't understand how much this affected my adult life, until I started reading about it, and making the connections. It is a real daily struggle. I've read some of the other threads, and thank you so much for sharing your stories, that is what gave me the strength to call the GP. Wish me luck for tomorrow, and hope that I don't vomit in the waiting room....",Set_Me_Free,Community Member,30-05-2018,PTSD and trauma,10,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/newbie-hello-and-stuff/td-p/365645

PTSD-1559,Managing Complex+PTSD plus BPD - Acknowledging The Good With The Bad,"My brilliant trauma therapist always corrects me when I say the last five years have been a life + death battle. She says, ""no your whole life has been"". I acknowledge that and just learning to recognise my feelings and listen to my gut when trigger events arise. Triggers come in many forms for me, which I am developing techniques to deal with them, especially when I know a severe trigger event can send me into a potential crisis. For me, the signs are numbness, confusion, emptiness and withdrawing. Severe events I shut down and become catatonic. For years I was surrounded by family (dysfunctional + emotionally detached), shallow friendships and soulless corporate colleagues, not knowing I was mirroring behaviours as that was all I knew. When it came time to share the story of my trauma experiences, including my mother's and my intellectually disabled sibling, with those that I considered close, it tended to fall on ""deaf ears"". My experiences were generally compared by those that I entrusted my trauma experiences with, as similar to their parent's divorce or ""we all have a hard life, yours is no different to mine, so just get over it and move on"". What I found was the even though the people around me said they loved or cared for me, their actions and behaviours were not congruent. When I had my catastrophic breakdown aged 43, the people that surrounded me significantly amplified my negative psychological situation. Which would playout horrifically for almost five years. Thankfully, I have discovered how to find healthy relationships and supports, which has helped me significantly turn my life quality positively around. I have changed certain negative behaviours around too, which will be an ongoing personal project. My point of this post is that even as things can get better, we can slip up on occasion. For me, that was when my beloved cat got run over and passed away the other day. He was instrumental in saving my life, and my direction in life. I have what I call emotional delay, I cried first up, but the real emotional stuff kicks in a day or so later, and then negative behaviours can slide in, which occurred last night. Due to my emotional state, I acted up (a sign that I am in distress) towards the people that had caused my traumas. Today, I will be sending communications to those people, apologising for my behaviour, knowing they will never acknowledge how their actions and inflictions caused me trauma + pain.",Christopher_T,Blue Voices Member,08-06-2018,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/managing-complex-ptsd-plus-bpd-acknowledging-the-good-with-the/td-p/378418
PTSD-1560,Domestic abuse causing problems years later,"Morning I’ve never actually posted in a forum or spoken about my history with anybody but friends and family. I was in a domestically abusive relationship for 5 years. I have a son from that relationship. It’s been 7 years since I walked away but I have suffered (what I believe, never diagnosed) with severe anxiety and highs and lows ever since. I have been married to my current husband since November 2012 and we have 3 beautiful kids together. Our youngest is 6 weeks old. Within the last week I have felt so so low. Have lost all my energy and strength to be their mother. I able only making it through each day I don’t know how. I don’t want to get out of bed most days and takes it out of me to continue to do it. I think all of what I’ve been through has ended me up to this point now and I need help. I don’t want To miss my children growing up because I feel this way. I have felt the anxiety before after children were born but this time it’s worse and so different. Everything just seems pointless. It’s is physically hard to do anything because I’m so exhausted. I think my kids deserve a better mother and I feel like a failure to them. I don’t feel as connected to my youngest baby the way I did with her siblings. I love her but I’m not as connectEd with her. I don’t really like talking on the phone and I’m terrified that if I saw someone locally they would take my kids away. I’ve never been able to get my license because of anxiety problems and I’m not qualified for anything. My first son was born straight after graduating school. And I’ve done nothing else with my life since. I feel pathetic. I want to be better for my children because they deserve it. I want to feel stronger then I am right now.

PTSD-1562,Am I in an abusive relationship? [Trigger Warning: Domestic Abuse],"Hello, I've been with my fiance for nine years. Our wedding is scheduled for later this year. However he has lately become more and more explosive when I don't feel like having sex because I'm on medication which affects my libido. For example, last night it was his birthday and I was feeling sick and did not want to have sex so he pushed me off the bed and kicked me when I was down on the floor. He said I ruined his birthday, even though I took him out to breakfast and bought him multiple gifts and put a lot of effort and thought into the day. When he is angry he tells me I'm not intellectual enough, that I drag him down and that I'm a horrible, mean and nasty person. He says that I have the intellectual and emotional capacity of a child and that it is hard work being in a relationship with me. He says no one else would put up with me or love me like he does. The last time we had a fight he tore all my clothes from the wardrobe and snapped all the coat hangers. Then he turns around and acts sweet the next day like nothing happened. He also says that everything bad in the relationship is my fault. I'm actually scared now of entering into a marriage with someone who constantly belittles me in arguments. He even said if I ever talk about our relationship to anyone I know then I will have to get out and leave. Is it normal for people to act like that when they are angry/arguing? Is it normal for your partner to insult your intelligence and blame you for everything? Other people think of me as a very polite, thoughtful and caring person and no one else in my life would describe me the way he does. Am I over reacting? Should I be worried? Is this verbal/emotional abuse? Or just someone with a temper? I feel really confused and worried.

PTSD-1563,I’ve been lying to my family for 6 years.,"When I was 8, a terrifying fear came alive. My parents were going through a divorce at the time and it would tear them apart to find out. This was the first step in my adventures that would cease to end. Once my parents spilt was final, another problem arose; my mother would withhold custody from my father if she knew what his brother did to her daughter. She even liked to talk about how “if that man had ever touched you, tell me and I will make sure that I tell your father you’re not going there ever again” she didn’t mean it as a threat to me but I still remember the imminent danger it possessed. I was only 8. Years later and these were the things constantly weighing me down and always at the back of my mind. Then I was 14 and my father sat my sister and I down to talk about why we were so afraid of his brother and that our fear of him was merely a product of my mother’s manipulation. I then broke down and began telling the tale of when my uncle sexually harassed me. He stood up and walked out of the room, no words spoken. We went to my nonno’s funeral that day and later on at the wake, my father pulls me aside and tells me my uncle has a chemical imbalance in his brain, that makes him more sexual but he takes medication for it so it’s under control. This was honestly the excuse he had to say that I had to have been lying. Now, my 2 year old sister that I don’t live with is apparently my uncle’s “favourite niece” and I’m so scared because I know it will happen to her eventually but there’s nothing I can do about it without losing my dad. It breaks me down further and further in so many ways.

PTSD-1565,Nowhere to go,"Hi to everyone who takes time to read this. I’m looking for some advice on how to deal with my current situation. My de facto partner of 7 years broke up with me one month ago. He has told me his reason is because he wants to sleep with other women and he likes his freedom (i.e. not having to think about me or have me wondering where he is at night). He broke up with me 2 days before my birthday and on the same day deleted a majority of photos on social media - making me feel as if I never existed. During our relationship I felt like he lived 2 separate lives - I was frequently excluded from his social life. And at the end of his relationship I became so aware of the fact that I had never even met some of his closest friends that he would see regularly. During the first 3 weeks of the break up I was living with my mother (with no where else to go). I have a bad history with my mother who during my teenage years kicked me out of home - without going into detail, it was an event that has traumatised me (PTSD). So when living with her again I felt uncomfortable and problems began to crop up again with her being emotionally abusive towards me. A huge argument has left me with no option but to go back to my ex boyfriends house and I also feel the need to now cut all contact from my mother. So, now my current problem is that I feel I should be away from my ex and move on. Hard to do when I have no where else to go (no other relatives and I only have 1 friend but I don’t want to live with her). My ex is also telling me he loves me and keeps bringing up marriage in the future and asking me to support him through his own personal problems - treating me like a secret gf? He also is forcing sex on me. I am on affordable housing wait list but am told the wait is around 1 year. I am not earning enough to rent privately and am currently looking for a new job. Please help! I don’t know what to do and I’m feeling very alone.",LittleLostB,Community Member,28-05-2018,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/nowhere-to-go/td-p/360730
PTSD-1566,"PTSD and the military, the big problem.","I did 20+ years in military, multiple tours. And I don't have PTSD. And a lot of soldiers coming back don't either. I'd like to address a couple of points which I think the public has become mixed up on, with the best of intentions, but is actually effecting soldiers chances of returning to normal life. The first is this assumption ""most soldiers probably have PTSD"" is effecting their chances of employment. One of the best things can happen to a soldier with or without PTSD is to be able to transition into civilian life... Via a JOB!. Particularly for mature aged soldiers the assumption they may be prone to PTSD, even extreme violence or suicide is not doing any favours. Previously, an armed services background was CV booster, its starting to swing the other way again. The second is soldier attitudes towards PTSD, too many treating pensions as a cash cow. Its an unfortunate reality that any system will be abused by some, and if its easy to abuse that some becomes many. The boys have the routes, doctors, best psychs to see, advocates and performances mapped out. I warn them if we overload the system the government will make it harder to approve, stop indexing or tax the current pensions (They are starting to do this already)Then the folks really needing the support will not get it, and we will be back with vietnam era support= Zero. I also don't like the heavy drug protocols they recommend for soldiers reporting with any depressive issues. Too often they start with a mild complaint, go direct to anti depressants, end up on anti-psychotics with addictions and suicide issues. This is the wrong direction for treatment! The US is starting to have a strong look at this and I hope Australia will soon too Some facts on soldiers which may or may not interest folk. 1. Only 1 in 7 soldiers have combat related roles. For every front line corps there are 6 cooks, drivers, medics, bandsmen, storeman, mechanics, dentists, callibrationists, etc. 2. Despite the Middle East being not a very nice place, and the risk of bombings, Australias role was not high combat risk in this war. 40 something deaths over 10 years still makes it safer than underground coalmining or offshore fishing. Not less fear no, but not the level the public assumes either. The facts and breakup of general soldiering do not support all the claims of ""battle and bloodshed'. Most soldiers in fact will never see or hear of a person being killed in their area during a 6 month deployment.",JJ41,Community Member,31-05-2018,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-and-the-military-the-big-problem/td-p/367013

Our first was unplanned as we were only together 6 months when we fell pregnant. He is really tough on him and expects a lot. I find myself telling the kids to do this or that before daddy gets home otherwise they’ll get in big trouble. Or I will. He seems to blame me when the kids leave a mess with toys or food. I can’t watch them every second of the day. The house is never clean because I don’t have time and gets dirty about it even though we both work. He says it doesn’t bother him but as soon as he walks in, you can see it on his face. Everything always seems to be my fault and I’m just always wondering what he is going to jump on me for next. It’s like I’m always walking on egg shells to be safe and I feel like I have to be a referee between my 4.5yr old and husband. I love him but I don’t know if I’m actually happy. We seem to fight a lot and I just don’t know what to do. I’m on medication for post natal depression since having our 2 year old. But it doesn’t seem to be helping or there’s just more to it. I’ve discussed us getting counseling but he won’t because he would have to take a day off work. His family is also an issue but he won’t see it.

PTSD-1570,Surrounded by abusive relationships,"Hi, I don't even know how to portray how loneuI feel. I have had an on and off abusive relationship with my partner of 14 years and it is in the off stages again. My partner could be quite abusive and would have a ""snap"" and have extended periods of yelling anywhere from 2mins to an hour. I have finally separated for him to sort himself out. He is admitting full blame, we have two children together and he is saying he hasn't done right by them and that everything is his fault, our poor financial situation, the anger and he has taken a few steps to show he is possibly serious. He has made a plan and seems to be following it and in the meantime we're having space and contact is occurring surrounding the Children to be able to see them as he has moved into a friends house and the situation does not yet permit any kind of routine situation as he is still setting up a room limited space etc and I am residing with my mother and my youngest is staying with me and during week mornings my son is dropped off to me before my partner begins work. My problem now is my mother seems to think I should be having absolutely no contact with my partner, she is jealous to the extreme of anyone getting closer to me than she wishes to be and is constantly guilting and questioning my decisions. I have an entire lifetime background of this manipulative self centred behaviour. I was stolen from as a child, entire bank accounts and trust funds sucked dry, money my father gave me as pocket money, I was made to believe I had behaviour issues, called slag and constant filthy references to my sexual character from childhood. My own father was a highly abusive individual who my mother left when I was 10 and who could never get along with in a civil moment from that day forward. I had school functions ruined because of their inappropriate conduct having altercations etc yet would run back to him the minute she needed money and he would give it as a kind of control. I was put right in the middle of it. Is my mother doing this to me because she is jealous that there is civility in my situation?

PTSD-1572,Struggling to accept this life,"Hi all, How do you accept life and its challenges after losing your fiance? It's been 1.5years since his accident and was only 28years old, now it' just me and 3 little kids. I self medicated with alcohol to the point I'd sometimes cry taking the first sip but continue to have 20 more, put me in a very dark place. I managed to detox of alcohol and am almost 8months sober. Since quitting the drink I turned to exercise excessivly and barley eat a meal a day, lost 30kg in 3months, im 57kg and still think I'm fat. Getting help from psychologist with that. I just cant handle doing this all on my own. The chaos with the kids. My self esteem is in the dirt after our relationship turned abusive and now hes gone. Most the time i dont know how I feel. I was angry at him for so long for getting himself in the situation that ended his life, and guilty for being angry. Relieved I don't have to put up with alot of crap anymore but then guilt for feeling that. Im angry that my young kids dont have a dad anymore, and really struggle to do the dad things. They should be going fishing, bike rides, surfing with their dad. But now they sit at home and fight. I'm on antidepressants, the first 9 weeks were fine but then it felt like something snapped and I have no tolerance for anything, switched to a new one it might need more time to work. I wish I had the patience and love to read them a book before bed but I don't, im fed up and just want them to get to sleep. Do i just accept this is my life now?

PTSD-1573,Am I a fraud?,"I have recently come to the realisation that I am a victim of sexual assault. That being said, I feel like a fraud for saying that as I have probably gotten off relatively unscathed in the grand scheme of things, but I still haven't been able to eat all day. I've started writing this post a number of times now but can't seem to articulate what I'm thinking correctly. I was in a ""sexual agreement"" lets just call it with two different guys at two different times, one after the other. I have since come to acknowledge that I was emotionally abused by both men, and sexually coerced by both men as well. I still can't figure out if what happened to me counts as sexual assault (as we were in a sexual relationship at the time) and am still struggling to come to terms with what that means. 2 out of the 3 people I have asked about this have minimised what happened and told me to move on. I'm just trying to figure out if that is in fact what I should do as I'm overreacting, or if in fact it's as complicated as I feel.

PTSD-1575,Torn,"Hi Everyone, My sister was raped at the beginning of the year and is in a difficult place right now. There is a decision to be made today and she is really struggling with what direction she should make. One part of her wants to peruse charges and the other part of her doesn’t want to be responsible for ruining someone’s life with a criminal record. She is truly the most kind hearted selfless girl and it pains me to see her in so much grief. It has also had a great impact on my family. My parents have been with her every step of the way, she has our entire support as a family unit. I am worried about my father who is showing increasingly worrisome behaviour. I can only imagine how traumatic it must be to watch your child go through such an ordeal. My mother has buried her head in distractions. I feel for them and feel very helpless. On top of this, I was sexually assaulted a few years ago by someone I considered a close friend and it really ruined a lot of things in my life. This whole situation has triggered a lot of emotional memories for me, I was not able to speak up the way my sibling has been able to due to the person being a manager at my work place and the fear of losing my job. I was foolish and continued to see this person later down the track as I was just a wreck and alone and so very confused by my life as I once knew it falling apart. I feel like I am going through this again with my sister but at a far greater level. As now my whole family is going through the trauma and watching someone we care so greatly about in so much agony that we cannot fix. All I can do is let her know that she is supported, that I love her and that there is no right or wrong way of processing this. But when it comes to my parents, how do I support them. They have been through so much and been pillars of strength for my brother my sister and I. I worry so much about them and just want to see them living happily at this stage of their lives. They deserve it. I feel exhausted.",darkbetty,Community Member,21-05-2018,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/torn/td-p/421040
PTSD-1576,Single Mum Struggling to cope [Trigger Warning: Domestic Abuse],"Hi I’m a single parent to a 3.5 year old girl. I left her Narcissistic Father im WAS when she was 2.5 months old to free us from his emotional, psychological, financial and verbal abuse when it started to get physical and I was concerned he would rape me. I moved back to SA where my family are from, but couldn’t get childcare and hence couldn’t work. I always dreamed of living back in QLD, where I spent 7 years and have many work connections. I also could get childcare right away. I don’t regret moving. I love QLD and I’m working. What’s hard is being a single parent with no suppprt and then dealing with a child who regresses in her toileting (5-6 accidents a day) post spending time with her Father. The Father doesn’t care, the family court didn’t care and the Independent Children’s Lawyer didn’t care. I saw my GP today and I present well. It’s the mornings and nights with my Daughter when she’s constantly not listening and having accidents that I sit on the floor and cry. I don’t drink and exercise is part of my job, that’s what’s helped me not give her up when I feel like I have had no time for myself these past 3.5 years. It’s just compounded by her out of character behaviour post visit. I look on the positive side, try and get enough sleep etc...but I am getting worn out. Court is now over after 2.5 years and I tell myself that things will get better. But I don’t think I actually believe it. Does anyone co parent with a Narcissist? Do you know where I could get help for my Daughter and I so we don’t turn on each other?

PTSD-1577,Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,"I've been experiencing signs of PTSD over the past month or two stemming from when I was a child and had a ver traumatic childhood. Forms of emotional and physical absue, separation from a parent and I never had a stable homelife wherever I was. My mum was also diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, bipolar and anxiety when I was 20, after she had been treated with severe depression since she was 16. This misdiagnosis caused further trauma to myself as I had to deal with a lot growing up and after she was diagnosed properly I then cared for her whilst studying full time at uni and I was also in a very abusive relationship. I have mentally blocked out things from what happened to me when I was a child, however, recently I have been getting flashbacks and nightmares. I'm experiencing a lot of anxiety and irrational thinking. It's affecting so many things in my life and I'm so scared that I'm going to lose them. Mainly my relationship with my wonderful partner. I tend to push people away and not let people in when I'm experiencing anxiety or negative thoughts as I've always had to look after myself and now I'm so worried that any partner no longer feels the same way about me. He also suffers from mental health problems and I support him through that. He had a bad episode early last month and I helped him through a lot of it. I've never been treated for any kind of mental health problems but I'm going to see my doctor this week to see if we can set up some kind of counselling or perhaps a mild form of medication as I would rather take on the PTSD using therapies and not rely on medication. I'm usually a highly positive person but I've had quite a lot of worries and events in my life happen over the past 8 months and I think the excess stress is what has triggered things. if anyone can offer me some advice that would be amazing.

PTSD-1578,Confused :(,"Hi, I’m really struggling at the moment. My story; I have recently broken up with my partner, I love him but he’s said and done things recently which have really hurt me. We had been together a year, the first few months were bliss and then he started to change, if I said the wrong thing he would flat out ignore me like he was teaching me a lesson, withhold sex and tell me I shouldn’t have said or done this or that. He had always been a little possessive but I took it as though he just really loved me, he has no friends, and isn’t close to his family so I was the only one who he could rely on. He’d often try and make me feel guilty or change plans if I made them with my friends or family and if I didn’t, he’d use it against me to further guilt me. It felt quite innocent until he started losing control of his temper, the look of anger would consume his face and eyes and then he’d hit something, punch something or hit his head against the wall. I’ve never been frightened like that before, I didn’t know that side of him existed and every time he would tell me that I drove him to do it because I wouldn’t shut up or I’d say something to trigger him. I didn’t speak with anyone until only recently but she mentioned that he sounded like a narcissist and I was being emotionally abused. The man I fell in love with was a sweetheart. I had been going through a tough time for months and it was becoming so overwhelming that I lost my appetite, had trouble sleeping and would become nauseas eventually vomiting. Sometimes a few times each night for a period of days. My partner became aware of this and asked if I was pregnant. I told him no, he’d asked me to get an implant in my arm which I had very early into the relationship. A couple of days after we had an argument and he told me if I fell pregnant then he would expect me to have an abortion and if I didn’t, he would most like resent me and the baby. I was devastated that he could say such a thing, I couldn’t breath I was so upset and all he just walked away and laid on the couch. He blames everything on me and will not accept any responsibility. I would break down in front of him and he would roll his eyes. What I’m struggling with most right now is that it feels like I had been sleeping next to someone I didn’t know for a year and I feel like he tricked me. I don’t know if he is a narcissist or if this is emotional abuse but this doesn’t feel like just a break up, I feel like something has been taken from me.",Br1sbaneg1rl,Community Member,10-05-2018,PTSD and trauma,12,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/confused/td-p/404812

PTSD-1581,"My PTSD story *trigger warning: child abuse, physical violence, domestic abuse*","Hi all, I've been thinking about starting this thread for a day or so now, I'm hoping that my story may help others in their PTSD journey, and maybe myself too. I was physically and emotionally/verbally abused throughout my childhood by my brother, mother and stepfather. I grew up in a loveless environment and learnt from an early age that being as invisible as possible was the only way to survive. Once I started high school, the abuse at home was added to by bullying at school and when puberty hit that's when my mental health issues started to really show. When I was 16, my stepfather locked my dog up in a tiny corner of the back yard and I couldn't get over to feed him so my mum gave him away. When my stepdad got home that night, I yelled at him and instead of hutting me like he usually would, he packed his bags and left. My mum blamed me and kicked me out of home. I lived on the streets for a few months before moving into a youth home. I struggled through life for a few years thinking that no-one understood me or loved me etc. I met a boy and we moved in together when I was 18. It was through him that I met D (not her real name). D and I became like sisters. I had never had such a close friend and I had never felt happier in my life. After a few years my relationship broke down and so did D's. We helped each other through our breakups and she introduced me to some friends of hers. We started going nightclubbing as a group and things started looking up again. That's when things changed forever. One night in 2000 D and the girls turned up at my home. They were angry and forced their way into my house. For three hours they beat me up and broke my jaw. D then took everything of sentimental value to me and threatened to harm my 3yr old brother and 6yr old niece if I went to the police. I went to the hospital and called my mum. I told her what happened and then I called the police. I lied to them at first. I was so scared. After spending three days in the hospital I went back to my mum's place. I could no longer enter the house I had lived in for years without having panic attacks. After a while I met another man and we ended up living together. He had BPD and I wasn't equipped to deal with it. He became abusive and I ended up moving out. I was put into a housing trust unit and that's when I became agoraphobic. I hadn't received the PTSD diagnosis yet and for a few years locked myself away. There's a happy ending to this, but I'm out of room.",Lici,Community Member,04-05-2018,PTSD and trauma,41,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-ptsd-story-trigger-warning-child-abuse-physical-violence/td-p/396861
PTSD-1582,Begin Again: Starting again after abuse,"My story started when, after suffering depression and an eating disorder, i was raped at 17. It then happened again at 19. I was also sexually harassed In a scary way at various jobs. When i was 20 I ended up getting into a relationship with an abusive alcoholic. He wasn't abusive right away, it happened slowly. Over time he became more controlling and verbally abusive, then slowly the physical and sexual abuse started. About 3 years into the relationship I got sick, very sick. My ex would steal my pain medication and was very controlling about me seeking medical care. At one point i was in agony for almost a week before he let me seek care and I ended up needing to be hospitalised for nearly a week. After 4 and a half years i finally managed to leave him but he continued to threaten and harass me. After 7 months of going back and fourth to court I finally got a year long family violence order. That was a month ago. I have since been diagnosed with complex PTSD and after having to leave my studies and work due to stress and abuse related physical illness (which i have been in and out of hospital for 18 times in the past 2 years or so) I find myself starting my adult life all over again at 26.

PTSD-1583,What would you consider physical or emotional abuse and how would you go about dealing with it?,"Hi, I'm in a bit of weird relationship, been together for 3 years and it's her first relationship. She comes from a really high-intensity household, a lot of yelling and so on, so obviously she follows suit in that behaviour. I, on the other hand, am a very calm and cool person and have a very hard time understanding her aggression. Her aggression as you can probably tell comes out in some interesting ways, insults(calling me fat), pushing, silent treatment, threats (to end the relationship) and a couple angry hits when she lashed out. I've never been physically hurt that bad, she has hit me but not to a point where I was sore and I can very easily walk away from the situation or stop the fight completely. I always try to stay calm when we are fighting and have never hit back, nor do I ever say anything mean. From what I can understand, when we are fighting I always try to lighten the mood and put a smile on her face, which normally works for the time, but always comes back up later on as I am the bad guy. There is also some more confusing things, like the other night we basically broke up and we live together so it was really awkward and now she has crawled back to me and acted like nothing ever happened, now she is really anxious because she doesn't understand why I am still upset. This has happened quite a few time throughout the years too. During a really bad time of depression in my life, she was there to recommend medication and did help a bit, but also during that time she also called me weak and that I was making it up and the likes. In summary, it really seems to me that because of her upbringing she's very, ""build a bridge and get over it"", while I dwell on things a lot more. Because of that time in my depression and how she reacted I genuinely consider her a bad person and do resent her for it, still to this day she is very unempathetic and has said that she hates me, doesn't find me attractive and so on. I'm not sure if I am wrong in my judgement of her though, she's tough and nasty but also a well put together person and she is also quite smart, she works a good job and has decent morals for her career at least, but it just seems to me that she is kind of a sucky person, whilst everyone else thinks she is an angel. Honestly, I do feel a bit lost, am I the problem? Is my judgement inaccurate? I don't know who to turn to and of course, I feel weak for considering what she says and does to me as abuse?",AmJp,Community Member,12-05-2018,PTSD and trauma,13,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/what-would-you-consider-physical-or-emotional-abuse-and-how/td-p/406655
PTSD-1584,An introduction and saying hello [Trigger Warning: physical and sexual assualt],"Hi everyone. I am currently going through a lot and dont really have anyone I can talk to. In a nutshell, when I finally left my abusive husband I found out he was also abusing my children. He molested my daughter, whipped my older son with bamboo, terrified my younger boys and even managed to turn my middle son against his family who has now disowned the rest of us because we believed and backed my daughter when she finally disclosed her abuse. 2 weeks ago he was convicted for what he did to my daughter after a trial that has left her an emotional wreck to the point where she has self harmed. As I am the only adult and need to be the strength that holds everyone together I haven't been able to face or deal with the trauma from the abuse I was dealt, the trauma and horror and guilt that came with the realisation that my children also suffered at the hands of that monster, the trauma and stress of the trial and being torn apart by the defence lawyer, the grief that comes with one of my children being so brainwashed by my ex that he has disowned me, and the rest of my family and during the time all this is going on being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and all the fun things that go with that ...the list goes on and seems endless, but the bottom line is I feel like I am screaming on the inside but have to be the sole support system for my family so I just keep stuffing it down. I am feeling very isolated and alone, physically restricted due to the RA and I guess even lonely, but at the same time I withdraw from everyone except my children, to the point where I won't or at least cant bring myself to answer my phone Anyways, thats me.

PTSD-1588,My girlfriend is verbally and emotionally abusive to me when things go wrong for her,"I have been in this relationship for two years now but I'm starting to think that it's having a detrimental effect on my own health and well-being. While the intimacy issues are not a problem any more, I have for the most part got over these and we enjoy a normal intimate relationship. I love her dearly and want to be with her but sometimes she can be very cruel. The problem is that when things go wrong for my partner, she takes it out on me. I end up getting verbally and emotionally abused. She has no friends, and no close family. The less severe 'episodes' involve silent treatment, where I will be trying to comfort her and find out what the problem is and she simply won't respond. I understand sometimes we don't want to talk about things, but I end up being completely ignored. Eventually I get snapped at, more or less being told to leave her alone. I'll try to give her a hug or something and I'll be pushed away. Given the fact that I have quite bad self-esteem issues, largely as a result of the intimacy problems I've experienced while in this relationship (ED due to anti depressents) I find this treatment really hard to cope with. More severe incidents have included where I've been physically shoved and pushed. Last weekend was one of these. It started off with long, drawn out silent treatment. After a whole evening of this I got tired of this explained that it's not fair to take out whatever the problem is (in this case, a work issue) on me- I'm here to help and support. I tried to give her a hug and was verbally abused. In that tyrade of being yelled at she inferred that I only wanted to hug her because I wanted one thing only (sex). I see a counsellor to help with my anxiety and relationship issues. He is concerned that my relationship is abusive. I never saw it that way, however after this last weekend I am starting to see it now. For the first time, I realised that I am being treated differently to how I treat her - it's not equal in any way. I miss being in a relationship where I can feel relaxed and comfortable and not have to worry about what the next episode is going to be. My partner has been quite supportive of me in my ups and downs. I do want to persevere through this as I don't want to lose her, and I do love her very much. She is a nice person and does care for me, but there is a mean streak that comes out I don't know how cope with it any more.

PTSD-1590,"Diagnosed PTSD, depression, anxiety but feel nothing","Hello everyone, I decided to come on here to maybe get some answers to what I am feeling or just someone to share it with. I recently decided to seek professional help with a psychologist. After the introduction session he said he believes I have PTSD, depression and anxiety; he explained that we can work through this stuff in order to achieve what I was seeking which was ultimately being more assertive as I am training to be a nurse and I am shy. Anyway, I was really shocked that he “diagnosed” me with PTSD because I was unaware that I was experiencing it. I have had two traumas in my life when I was 16 and 21 and I am now 23. However, I never seeked help because I guess part of me thought it was no big deal what happened but I’m not sure if I felt that way because people around me made me feel like what happened was nothing; so I essentially coped with the idea that it was. I guess what I’m getting at is I don’t understand how he can diagnose me with PTSD when I said I don’t really feel much from it? Sometimes I wonder if the trauma hasn’t affected me but without me realising it? Like subconsciously I have been suffering without mentally being aware of it? Is that even possible? I’ve tried to explain this to other people but they just don’t understand me. I just want some answers because I guess now that he has said that it’s been eating at me whenever I feel emotional about something that there’s is something underlyingly wrong with me. I know I should of seeked help ages ago but I was always too afraid because I feel like people will think i want pity for what has happened or attention so whenever I tell people I tend to say it with a smile and say it’s no big deal.

She has written abusive letters and phonecalls, which dont makesense, we let them live in our rental, our son lived in it with his brother before meeting her ,they were ideal tenants, she moved in and the place was trashed,we had to fix it and sell it, she has convinced our son he has had a horendous upbringing ,made sure he doesnt see any friends and his siblings. She is on drugs and we have been recently told she is now giving them to our son and she verbally abuses him daily. Yet he still stays. This year we didnt get to see him christmas or his birthday ,she never turns up he until this year would come alone for half an hour most of that time We love our and are at a loss of what to do. There is an argument that is in her head we have never argued with her but have been yelled at , she makes up issues , we sold the family home and moved into an apartment because we are in fear of our sons wife .Son 2 is happily married to girl who only has things her way, when it comes to us, we were not allowed family or friends at there wedding, her parents were, I was told by her father “boys dont see there mothers once they are married !!!, “I look after there daughter once a month but have to do the pick up and drop off, I am unable to pick her up now , I am still happy to have her, I now look after our other grandchild ( son 3’s child) on the same day ( both are under 2 ) I am strife again. I dont have two car seats, I cannot do the right thing by these girls and thus miss out on seeing my sons too, son 2 wife this year has told me there will be no mothers day as she wants to do it as a family. I cannot help wonder what I have done so wrong as its me who gets most of the flack. Things are good with son 2’s wife as long as I agree with everything and dont have an opinion.I am becoming more depressed we have tried so many avenues for help with son 1 and keep hitting brick walls. I am frightened of the two girls and have the most to loose, we dont understand how our sons stand by there behaviour, Until son 1 met his wife we spent years as a family together the kids had a great bond.This bond was broken by son 1 s wife.",Darbs,Community Member,02-05-2018,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/parental-abuse/td-p/389540
PTSD-1592,"Struggling-sue my own mother? why didn't anyone protect me? *Trigger Warning, Domestic Violence and Child Abuse*","I was brought up under extremely physical abusive, neglectful and emotionally abusive circumstances as a young child. Until my adult years, I lived with her and she continued to emotionally abuse me-she still does when she gets the chance. I have some questions for the Australia police and whoever was supposed to be looking after children. My mother LITERALLY ran a car into me. I reported all the physical abuse as a child. WHY WAS I LEFT WITH HER STILL? I can't understand it! I incidentally recorded a few videos as a teenager-whenever she would intrude on one of my body checks (I have severe eating disorders ,did I mention my teeth and skin are entirely ruined from bulimia and weight change). Even the mildest forms of emotional abuse upon reflection were absurd and this was a constant that I grew up with aside from the drug/alcoholism and physical abuse. I would say something quite clearly such as, ""I didn't want to hurt my back"", and she would say, ""You haven't hurt your back you liar, you bitch..!""...etc. etc. Oh not to mention, it seems I have a criminal record..or something? My wonderful mother used to call the police on me I think for payback for the few times I did it to her. You know..that time you were smashing down my door with hammer? I didn't even call them during some of the most serious physical assaults. How could, whatever party was responsible for looking after Australian children, leave me in her care? My father is a GP. However, he was severely beaten as a kid, which probably explains why he was attracted to such a shit stain as my mother. He didn't want to interfere with because his mum was lovely-it was his dad. My dad might be a GP but he is emotionally stunted, I'm really sorry. Unfortunately GPs earn way too much respect. Whomever's responsibility it was to make sure I got into a safe home clearly thought ""Oh fabulous, your father is a GP-she'll be fine"".....so why was I being abused? It is possible that, JUST MAYBE, dad unfortunately doesn't want to interfere? Dad is one of those people who says stuff is fine when it isn't-particularly with matters of his own. So when he said, ""I'll look after her"" or whatever he said to reassure the hospital, he meant ""I'll look after her for a week then give her back to her mother where she belongs, she was just crazy and kept the baby"".",Thermodynamic_Entropy,Community Member,01-05-2018,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-sue-my-own-mother-why-didn-t-anyone-protect-me/td-p/384096
PTSD-1593,I witnessed a murder,"I witnessed at murder when I was 16 years old. It was a brutal murder and I was a friend of the person who commited the murder and also friends with the victim. I have never forgotten that day, it constantly plays in my mind on a constant loop. I found it hard to sleep before this happened due to another trauma and after this happened I found it nearly impossible to sleep. I am plagued with nightmares and often I will stay awake until I am totally knackered and then go to sleep. I am still woken up 4-5 times a night with nightmares and a racing heart. It takes me ages to go back to sleep everytime and I feel like my body and mind are on constant autopilot. 23 years of no sleep is catching up with me. I get up for work at 5am and usually dont go to sleep until after midnight and have been doing this since I started my job 10 years ago. Now I am getting older I consistently feel exhausted.. I cant take sleeping pills because I am worried something bad will happen to me in my sleep ( from a past trauma). I am trying to meditate but its so hard for me to relax or even sit still. I feel like im always looking over my shoulder and now because of my exhaustion I find that my mind and body has had enough. I have been fighting for my right to some semblance of normalcy for 35 of my 40 years and I dont think I will ever be able to find it. I dont even know what life without fear is like.

PTSD-1594,"I stand with John, do you? *Trigger Warning - Assault*","John is a disability pensioner from Melbourne who has mental illness. His psychologist was worried about his deteriorating mental health and asked to check on him in September 2017. What happened next, in my opinion, was disturbing, sad, disgraceful and an indictment on the police force. Nothing short of appalling. John was brutally attacked by officers. He was taunted, humiliated and seriously injured, all under the auspices of the Mental Health Act. Police are empowered by this legislation to use force to take to hospital a person who appears to have a mental illness in order to keep them or others safe. I watched what actually happened to John on the news this morning and it left me shocked and horrified. What if that was my daughter needing help, needing care, needing support and that was her lying on the ground? I cried. I had to work hard to shake off the numbness I felt. Now I'm angry and moved to action. I'll be writing to my local MPs today. But I know it's not enough. Does anybody know how we support the ""John's"" of this world? Is John's story unusual? Has anything like this ever happened to someone you love? Or is it just unusual that his assault was all caught on film and has now been picked up by the media?

PTSD-1596,Complex ptsd shame and self loathing,"Hi everyone Ive been battling anxiety and OCD for some time. I recently moved cities and starting seeing a new psychiatrist who also diagnosed me with childhood PTSD. The diagnosis makes a lot of sense in some ways, and explains my anxiety and obsessive and intrusive thoughts but I also feel as though nothing *that bad* has happened to me to warrant this kind of diagnosis. To give you a bit of a run down, and I'm sorry if this makes anyone uncomfortable or if this is oversharing; I exhibited some probably uncommon sexual behaviours as a child. I must have repressed the memory of this until about a year ago when I suddenly remembered and was filled with shame, guilt, and self loathing all of which has left me extremely anxious and depressed. The thing is, I wasn't abused as a child, but rather I feel as though I abused myself. I'm finding it really hard to reconcile this within myself and feel like, I must have done this because deep down I am disgusting and abnormal person. I don't feel like I fit into the mould for someone with PTSD because I created this situation for myself. I see a psychologist regularly and am on medication but am not seeing much of an improvement with these feelings of self disgust and being abnormal.

Both my siblings have pretty much stopped a lot of contact with my Dad, and they moved states to be away from the family. To keep it short, my parents were pretty emotionally and mentally abusive and neglectful while all of us were growing up. My parents were physically abusive to one another, while also having rights in front of all 3 of us growing up. As well as they were heavy drinkers. While growing up, being the youngest meant I was stuck at home with my parents more often than my siblings. When the time came for them, they both moved out of home pretty quick. I couldn't wait to leave until I left High school. I have always felt a sense of responsibility for them because I have always patented my parents. It's been really draining.

PTSD-1599,"Family Issues (Emotional Abuse, Sexual Harassment) Reaching Breaking Point","Hi. This is my first post but I need to get this off my chest. I am a university student. I am set to graduate mid next year. I can not afford to move out until then. (I do have a job but it is only part-time). Lets get started. - 3 years ago my step father made several sexual advances and comments towards me. He also purchased various sexual items and inappropriately asked me to use them and tell him how I used them, etc. I only told my mother about this three days ago. It elicited a mixed response, with her mostly being upset I didn't tell her earlier. I felt helpless, I could not tell anyone because I knew he would hurt me. Today, he told me to 'stop being the victim' and get over it. - My step father has (mostly) emotionally and (on a few occasions) physically abused my mother for as long as I can remember. (He moved in with us when I was 4). He yells at her in public, at home, and uses obscenities every time, absolutely deteriorating her self-worth and mental health beyond what little there was left from her troubled childhood. He controls her finances and she has no friends. - My mother growing up was extremely protective of me as I was born 22 weeks premature and to a schizophrenic father, so naturally she was very cautious about what I was doing/what was happening to me. This resulted in me feeling extremely alone and helpless because of her constant problem-picking, often telling me I was the reason for the issues in their relationship (my step father has said this as well). I have been staying at my boyfriends place for the past week to just get away from it all. I have since spoken to both of them, whom of which they have apologized, yet told me that I am the reason for a lot of this happening. Confronting me alone, my step father told me to get over it all and told me to think about what I've done in ruining their relationship. I have the option of moving in with my boyfriend and his family. They are aware of what has happened and do not want me living in such a toxic environment that certainly affects my own lack of self-worth, depression and severe anxiety.

PTSD-1600,PTSD after being sexually abused on drugs,"I'm really new to this but really appreciate that there is a place to go to talk to people when I don't want to talk to a therapist or my family about what has happened to me. Last year I was living in Scotland on exchange. Being a normal college student, I was really into the party scene - drinking, drugs. I met a guy that was living in the flat below mine and we started chatting one night during a Flat party. He invited me to his room to smoke some weed, which I agreed to. I thought that we were nothing more than friends. I had way too much weed, and felt instantly sick and like I could pass out. I was a zombie. He recommended I sleep it off in his bed which I stupidly agreed too. A little while later, I woke up to him on top of me. I couldn't fight him because I was still so limp from the drugs. I ran away from his flat when he went to the bathroom and had to face him a lot since he lived below me. I remember that at the time I didn't think it was sexual abuse because I had taken the drugs, and I had put myself in that situation, and because he acted so normal with me every time I passed him in our building. I didn't tell any friends, or family at all because I was so ashamed of myself - I should have known better. A year on, there hasn't been a day that I haven't thought about it. I've never had any anxiety over it until recently. I've started becoming afraid to have sex, and I've had a couple of anxiety attacks when sex has been initiated with my boyfriend. It's like I'm in a dreamlike state when I look at him sometimes because he seems so foreign to me, and I start to get really terrified of him. I've told my boyfriend about it and he is so supportive. I know that it's better to talk about it but I can't even imagine telling my parents because I can just see how disappointed they would be in me for being so naive in that situation. I know that it's easy to say to victims of sexual abuse that ""it's not their fault"", but in my situation I really can't see how it wasn't my fault. I've never been so embarrassed. I don't really know what I'm expecting to get out of posting this as a new thread - I guess it would really help if there's anyone out there that has been abused while they were under the influence of either drugs or alcohol, but at the same time I know that there's not that many people that would put themselves in that sort of a situation.

PTSD-1601,Major anxiety after car accident.,"Hi guys. About a year ago now I managed to get hit by a massive truck and totally destroy my car, walked away somehow with only a few bruises when it all honesty it could have killed me. In the past year I've found myself getting a little more worked up over driving on the road but nothing major, just being more careful when turning etc. I do sometimes imagine though at intersections being hit by someone out of nowhere because when I did get hit I didn't even see the guy before he rammed into my side. That does kind of panic me a bit as I pass them but I feel like I can deal alright. Last weekend however I went on a road trip with my best friend who drove the whole way. She's still only a beginner p plate driver and I found myself freaking out the entire time she was driving, looking out at every intersection, checking her mirrors and being a horrible backseat driver by telling her to slow down or look out every minute or so. She got pretty annoyed with me (understandably) and said something along the lines of that she was a good driver and I was only making her more nervous and I needed to stop. I did, but found it extremely panic inducing, not having control of what was going on. I was just wondering if anyone had any tips on how to calm down a bit and just let other people drive. I feel like otherwise I've been pretty okay with dealing with everything. I got straight back into a car after the accident and haven't stopped driving since. Just a bit slower and more careful as a driver which I don't think is a horrible thing. When I'm driving with myself the only issue I found is when passing over intersections or doing u-turns because I'm just v. anxious that someone will slam into me again from a blind spot and it'll be too late for me to do anything.",Rabbits91,Community Member,18-04-2018,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/major-anxiety-after-car-accident/td-p/367611

In recent years gone by, I have started to confront a lot of my suppressed childhood trauma (which has been both difficult and enlightening). The most difficult aspect however, would definitely be coming to terms with the fact that I was sexually abused from the ages of 8-14 by four different people - despite family & friends not knowing at all. I think that this realisation is mainly due to the fact that I have become less naive, and more aware. I have begun to notice that a lot of my deep-rooted fears surrounding intimacy stem from this, and all I want is closure and to overcome this. My main question is how do I open up to family & friends about being sexually abused on multiple occasions? It happened so long ago, and I fear that they won't believe me. More importantly, I worry that it will cause family conflict mainly due to the fact that one of my abusers was a cousin.

PTSD-1611, Does anyone have any advice on how to get the words out and allow someone who truly does care in?,"hello discovered these forums last night during a sleepless night that seems to be a thing with my current depressive episode. i've never been successful in long term relationships. They get to about the 2-3 year mark and dissolve. My boyfriends are always lovely blokes, we don't fight and scream at each other and the relationships have ended amicably. After 5 years single, concentrating on staying well, living life and building my small business i met a wonderful man with 2 children about 18 mths ago. We all adore each other and i actually felt that for the first time in my life i was part of a wonderful happy functional family and that i had a happy future ahead. In October my beloved Dad passed away. The earth stopped spinning and my internal world imploded. He was elderly but in general good health for his age. His decline was rapid and his passing was a shock. Rationally i know that is the trigger to my current depressive episode. I am very very sad and can't seem to get passed his death. My sadness and emptiness has been going on since then and it is affecting my relationship with my boyfriend and his children. I'm no fun to be around, mostly low in mood and not chatty so i usually end up going home to my place so as not to make everyone else miserable. Sometimes i can fake a more positive mood but it doesn't last more than a week or so then i'm back low. i just want to be by myself. My boyfriend and his children have been pretty understanding giving me space and time to get over it but i can tell that he is getting frustrated with me and is almost at the end of his tether. The up and down of my moods are taking their toll on our relationship. I've tried to open a dialogue with him to explain how i'm feeling and whats going through my mind but i don't know how to really get it going into any depth.I feel that he also doesn't know what to do with me or how to deal with me. he says go to the doctor and get it sorted. Im in the process of that but it is taking time to get into an appointment via the ATAPS . I'm trying to get myself sorted but i'm very fearful i'm ruining a relationship i love very much and i don't know if i can live with myself if i do that.

PTSD-1612,Not myself,"A few nights ago the last thing I recall was turning the tv off and intending to go to bed....next thing it's 10am and I'm sprawled out on one of the single recliners woth the WORST headache ever and crying. My housemate came down from breaky at 8ish and said I was in my bed then. She must have dozed off briefly cos she doesn't recall hearing me go down the stairs. I have been taking medication for a long time now and this is the first time anything like this has happened. I have never sleep walked that i know of. Since this episode I have felt strange. Not myself not real nothing is real to me. I have not been through any excessive stress recently, only when I was a child was sexually abused. Im going to see my dr today but then m freaking out and scared.

PTSD-1613,Is it my fault?,"I'm 6 months down from meeting a man who has broken my spirit and taken everything from me. I've been emotionally abused for 6 long months and even now I've left him his words still torture me. I remember meeting him and he was so charming and he built me up so far telling me how fantastic I was, how clever I was, how special I was. I feel so stupid because I fell for it all. One fight was all it took...one fight where he was 6 hours late to pick me up but somehow I ended up apologising for meeting up with my married friend (cheating he said). I still can't believe how quickly I turned into someone who couldn't stand up for myself. What followed was months of ""I'm not sure I can handle you"", "" You're a lunatic"", ""You never want sex, I used to love it until you came along"", "" You're petty"", "" You're an idiot"" among other insults and put downs. The compliments stopped and they were replaced by constant criticism and avoidance. Unless of course I'd done something ""wrong"" like dare to call him out on things he was doing. I now know he was on dating apps and sleeping with other people unprotected the entire time and have had to go and get myself tested, I can't have sex anymore because I'm too afraid and I've ended up with vaginismus. The few times I've stood up for myself and said he did the wrong thing I've been met with accusations of "" you always spin things to suit you"" and ""you put words in my mouth"" followed by assertions I never deserved him or anyone. He has messaged anyone I've talked to, messaged my friends to discredit me, threatened to report me to my workplace. I'm terrified and I feel like a fool, somehow he's made me believe this is my fault, that I'm the horrendous person he made me out to be. Every single thing he's ever done he's justified by pointing out some flaw in me. I suppose I just need some support and someone to try and convince me I didn't do anything wrong because being here at rock bottom and hating and blaming myself is torture.",Kelizabeth,Blue Voices Member,06-03-2018,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/is-it-my-fault/td-p/394978
PTSD-1614,abandonment issues,"I suffer from PTSD as a result of childhood sexual abuse. Recently my partners work hours increased which means I have been seeing him less and as a result my anxiety has been triggered and escalated to a point where I fear leaving the house and on some days am afraid to even leave our bedroom.

Even though I'm now an adult and the abuse is over I still fear that bad things will happen when I'm alone, I watch the clock until my partner comes home from work fearing that he won't come home at all, feel guilty for having symptoms and get angry at myself when my strategies don't work...

He was extremely drunk and assualted me, damaged my car, stole my property and threatened to kill me. In the past I have tried to split with him due to his controlling and manipulative behaviour but he always did things such as trying to commit suicide or make me feel guilty so I’d be forced to stay with him. I did love him and we had planned such an amazing future together, but I’m struggling to keep myself from trying to contact him despite the fact that I have gotten an intervention order against him. He took our dog who was my baby and I still feel as though I want to sit down and talk to him about everything that’s happened. I don’t know if these feelings are due to the fact that I’m naive to what has happened or they are just part of the grieving process. I feel embarrassed and ashamed from what has happened and I’m feeling quite alone despite friends and family trying to be there for me.

PTSD-1616,Moving on after leaving emotionally abusive relationship,"I am hoping to get some advice from people who have been in a similar situation. I very recently left my partner of 12 years, who I share 3 children with, due to the relationship being toxic and unhealthy for both me and the children. During the course of our relationship he was very controlling, very jealous and insecure (went through my mobile daily), and I let him mold me into what he needed me to be - an extension of him - instead of being my own self. My own opinions, views, values, dreams and aspirations always came second to his or were completely wrong in his eyes - he could never see my side or see a different point of view other than his own. I could never say no to him, because if i did it was days and days of him punishing me by being abusive, ignoring and being horrible to me. I could never say no to sex, because it meant i didn't love him and he would sulk for days. If he wanted to buy something or spend money, even if it was ridiculous or we were broke, I couldn't say no for the same reasons. I don't know when or how it happened, but I eventually gave up. I gave up having an opinion, I gave up having a voice, and I gave up trying. I would just agree with everything he said. I never said no to sex, and there were times when I remember lying there just hoping he would finish quickly. When I started working again all the jealousy, insecurities and controlling behaviour came to blows and we had some very violent and aggressive arguments - some in front of the children - and I decided it was enough and it was over. It was the hardest decision I have ever had to make, to split up my family, to put my children through divorce and pain, and to cause extreme hurt to my husband - whom i still loved but could no longer be with. I'm now struggling to move forward, and have been so tempted at times to go back to him so that I can stop hurting. I never wanted this to happen. I am also struggling with finding myself, and who i am anymore. I feel like i have lost who i really am and i dont really know how to find that again. It has been 12 years of this abuse and I'm struggling to break all the bad habits i have made. I'm still living my life trying not to do things that might upset him - making sure i always have my phone on me just incase, making sure the house is clean etc. And i dont know how to break that pattern. I was hoping that perhaps others can relate and perhaps offer some advice to help me get through this tough time.",Chel-sea,Community Member,27-02-2018,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/moving-on-after-leaving-emotionally-abusive-relationship/td-p/383993
PTSD-1617,Never told,"Hey, everyone. I don’t really know why I’m writing this. A large part of my brain is screaming for me not to because it fears that my family will somehow find this and realise that it’s me. But I have to say something under the cover of a username. It took me over half an hour to hit the post button, my heart was pounding. I am afraid because I’ve never told them that I was assaulted over a decade ago (seven years old? Eight? Either one) and I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to. After many years, I was able to tell a very close friend of mine. I feel that’s a healthy step in the right direction, but I’ve never been able to verbalise or even hint at it to a psychologist. When I’ve seen a professional, it’s right there, in my mind. ‘I was assaulted when I was a child’. It’s right there, and sometimes it even manages to reach the back of my throat, but it gets trapped there. I don’t know why. I feel like I should be over it by now. I feel like I should be able to say, hey, it’s in the past, I’m an adult now. And for the most part, I don’t think about it, it’s not on my mind. I can go months and months without the memory appearing and my stomach twisting in anger because I should have done something instead of freezing like I did. But something triggers it and it reminds me, and I feel sick all over again, and like I just want to run up to the first person I see and tell them. I find men approaching me when I’m alone is something that both sets off my anxiety and my desire to fight if necessary. They could just be asking the time and I’d still have that reaction. Sometimes I wish they would try something, just so I could be justified in hurting them. There is an anger, very much alive in me. Then there’s things like being told I should get a pap smear because that’s important, but the thought of it makes me panic internally. I don’t want someone touching me, I don’t want to be exposed like that. It is important for my health, but I don’t want to. I am sick of these triggers and sick of being afraid and sick of keeping it locked inside where it chips away at me, surely sometimes without my knowledge. Maybe now that I’ve told you, it won’t get stuck anymore. Maybe I wrote this, disregarding the screaming of my brain, because I want my family to find out. Is that selfish of me? They’re good people, of course, and I’m sure they’d find a way to blame themselves. Is it selfish of me? I don’t know. I’m not sure. I hope not. I just don’t want to be sick anymore.",Lady_Stardust,Community Member,20-02-2018,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/never-told/td-p/375449
PTSD-1618,Hard to articulate,"Hello, I am struggling to articulate what I want to say. I always seem very confused with how I feel about things and situations so in turn I act and behave in ways I’m not sure is “correct”. Ahhh.. I’ll give an example. I have 3 babies and separated from my husband about 7 months ago. My oldest son (4) his biological father called me last week for the first time EVER. My husband took me in when I was pregnant and signed the birth certificate etc. I have been flooded with emotions, since he has called - happiness mostly. I adore this man... or do I? He is the most unstable, irrational and irratic human. He has been wondering why I am not mad at him and surprised I have reacted kindly. Everyone else has also wondered why I didn’t tell him to get lost, also. Why? I think I still love him.. Or am I just afraid he is going to leave my life at the drop of a hat again? I don’t know.. i don’t know how I feel. Why aren’t I mad at this man for leaving me and my baby whilst I was pregnant? Why do I forgive him so easily and he doesn’t even have to work for it. Why do I want to see him so badly?! Do I love him or am I just insecure? I want to make sure I keep things nice so he doesn’t disappear again. WHY do I care if he disappears again? Is it love or insecurity.. It’s killing me. I don’t know how to set up boundaries properly and the only thing I don’t want is for him to drop me and my son like a hot potato again.",Somebodyhelp,Community Member,14-02-2018,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/hard-to-articulate/td-p/366719
PTSD-1619,Is this a relapse? and of so will it pass?,"Hi all, this is my first post here but I wanted some opionons and support if possible. I have a diagnosis of complex PTSD - as much as one can have that when it's not in the DSM (yet). I have been doing quite well over the past 10 years having gone from not being able to work at all and being on the DSP to completing a vocational degree and working full time. I have also almost completed a second degree working full time and raising my 8yo son. Over the past two years I have has some signiffiant stress unrelated to the work/study commitments - some serious health problems and a relationship breakdown that ended in violence. I have kept my study up and even got a scholarship for the last year and a promotion late last year as well so I felt I was not slipping despite some serious anxiety. I went off medication last August - about 6 monbths ago now and this seemed to be fine. I went off as I felt I was managign really well and was sort of cured. All this has been with the support of a fantastic psychiatrist who I have seen for 8 years now - weekly for psychotherapy. What has happened recently is that I took 3 weeks off work. I was planning a lot of study to get a head start on the year but I absolutely hit the deck emotionally. I cried for about a week solid and my anxiety has returned with a vengance. Now I am back at work my anxiety is still there - quite disabling - and what I have also noticed are some very old thought patterns returning. Intense self criticism and feeling unwelcome and unwanted at work. It feels almost like a flashback to my early experiences in my family of origin but has been going for over a month now - longer than flashback? I am struggling to make sense of this and of course the advice is to go on medication again. It took me 5 months to come off antidepressants as I did this very gradually with the help of a compounding pharmacist so I am unwilling to go back on them if I can stick it out. Can people relapse with complex PTSD and does it pass on its own or will it get worse? I am worried a prolonged relapse will see me lose everything - job, study plans and my relationships. I have worked so hard to build these things. Any experiences other people have had would be helpful.

PTSD-1623,Husband of 17 years lost all feelings for me in 10 days.,"Hello everyone, Hoping to hear from anybody who has been through this. We have been together for 17 years, most of the time very happy. My husband was diagnosed with complex PTSD, depression & anxiety a year ago. He was prescribed antidepressants for suicidal thoughts & sees a psychologist. We love each other deeply but I have noticed big changes in him since we sought help & not positive changes! He has slowly cut everyone from his life, mother, friends. But worst was to come, 10 days ago he said he felt nothing..even for me. this happened so suddenly that I am in a state of shock, hurt & very distraught. Am I wrong in thinking this is the medication? Can't be a coincidence that a very loving man in 12 months of taking antidepressants has lost all emotion & love. I hope someone who has been through this can shed some light on this, we have been to the psychologist & her answer was to up his meds. I am heading to the Drs in the morning for help, I am so upset it's affecting my health. Starting to think he won't come back to me emotionally.

PTSD-1627,I broke my silence after 15 years,"Hi, I'm new and needed to join a support group and openly talk about my recent experiences. I was sexually abused as a child from roughly 8 years old - 14 years old by my father. I have kept this dark horrible secret for years, I've felt shame, guilt and also fear and to be honest blocked most of my childhood out. I gave birth to a beautiful son 2 years ago, and this event triggered postnatal anxiety and I became terrified of my son being around my father. The flashbacks of my awful past started happening and I've lately been in a constant state of panic and fear. I've never told anyone about my father abusing me for years, however on the phone to my brother the other day ( won't go into all the conversation details) but I openly confessed to my brother what had happened, then I ended up telling my husband and mother. It felt so good to get this awful stuff of my chest, but now I don't know what to do next. I made the decision to silence and remove my toxic father from my life, which was a great first step. My parents are divorced also and my mother is shocked, horrified and angry and she is feeling like a failure as a parent right now. My family is pressuring me into making a police report, but 1) I'm terrified and 2) Because it was so long ago, I feel that nothing can actually be done.

He was constantly accusing me of cheating on him which was not true but he would never believe me even when I could prove him wrong he still would not believe me.

PTSD-1631,"Stressed and anxious, just want to move on and start a new life (warning: possible triggers of sexual abuse)","My ex lives with his parents and two brothers 12 & 15. Approximately 3 months ago, I stopped our son (5 in March) from going to their house because on one night of him coming home from there, I caught him in two seperate moments behaving sexually on my bed (extremely inappropriate for a 5 year old) my mummy sences were on high alert. It clearly indicated to me that he had been exposed to online porn and/or been shown sexual behaviours, after that he didn’t want to speak about it. I took him to our GP ASAP, who called child protection and they got involved. However he is still allowed contact with his dad, just not at his house. My instincts from the start were that my son should not be going to that house because they are disrespectful to each other and used fowl langue around my son and other inappropriate things too. But I trusted his dad to protect him and I told him not to leave our son in his family’s care or leave him alone in his uncles bedrooms but he didn’t listen to me, no matter how many times I’d tell him. I felt guilty because I thought I was being too controlling or overprotective. Now that my ex has only just found a new girlfriend he has turned against me and is going through mediation because he feels like he doesn’t get enough say in his sons life (even though I have NOT stopped them from seeing each other!) I’ve just been worried for our sons safety and making sure he doesn’t take him back to that house again. Anyway in 6 months time or so, I’m hoping to move to a new town on the beach (where I know I will find happiness as I’ve wanted to move to the beach for a long time) about 4.5hrs away from my ex but I am happy to travel back there every 2nd weekend so my son and ex can spend time together. I’m just wondering can my ex stop me from doing this? Will mediation try to stop me? I’m sole carer of my son and always have been. I know what’s best for both of us. I am not running away. I just want to start a new life and find happiness after 6 years of a miserable relationship. I am so done with all this.

PTSD-1632,How to discuss difficult sexual feelings,"Hi everyone, I need some advice if anyone is willing to share. I have two concerns.... One... Does anyone find it almost impossible to talk to their therapist about sexual issues and feelings? I like my psychiatrist and he is excellent and I feel comfortable generally. But talking about anything sexual involves gestures and euphemisms or else I just blurt it out and want to melt into the floor and clam up. Either way I can't seem to discuss it. Any ideas to help? Two... Feelings of confusion and guilt. My backstory... High school sweetheart was a toad. I said no. He pretended not to hear. Abusive relationship. Many years later. Happily married. Husband is trustworthy and not remotely toad like. But I don't feel WANTED! That passionate don't want to take my hands off you sort of want. And the thoughts creep in. About how I must be sick and perverted because the only time in my life I felt like I was passionately wanted. Desired. Coveted. Was with the bloke who raped me and treated me like I was a possession. How do you broach THAT with a spouse?! Or even a therapist?! I can blurt it out awkwardly here. It's anonymous. A lot of people here know I'm strange and don't seem to mind me anyway. How did you separate feelings of PASSION from feelings of guilt? I would appreciate any advice.

My husband has been my best friend for 15 years but it hasn't been easy. 6 years ago, pregnant with our 3rd daughter I found out he had had a one night stand (when I was pregnant with my 2nd daughter). I only found out because the nurses thought I had an std so I confronted him. He promised me that it was only a one time thing & was a huge mistake. But after our daughter was born I found that he had a secret email account & had been sending dirty pictures to other women & vice versa. He was also on dating websites & watching an increasing amount of pornography. I kicked him out. Following this he attended a few sex addict counselling sessions & once again promised he would change & never do these things again. As time progressed I knew he was watching porn but I turned a blind eye. We now have 4 young children & I guess it was just too hard? I should have done something about it. 2 weeks ago I found a video on his phone of him having sex with a prostitute. It shattered me. I also found texts where he was clearly setting up another session. I told him I want a divorce & was going to move down near my parents so I had some support around me. But I just can't move on. I still love him & he has begun to disclose some information about traumatic events which happened to him as a child & I believe these have had a big impact on his actions over the past years. I feel like I need to support him to get help but at the same time I'm a mess & don't really have much help for myself. To complicate things we are waiting for the court date to come up mid next year in regards to our children & their assault so I feel I can't move until that happens. They need their counsellors & support which has been established here. I feel like there really aren't too many honest or good people in the world. The person who hurt my babies was the partner of one of my closest friends & since things came out she has not spoken to me & is still with him. My husband was my one 'true friend' but now I find it was all a lie. Everyone closest to me hurts me & breaks my trust. I carry on for the sake of my children but I am so utterly broken.",Lulu999,Community Member,06-12-2017,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/lost-trigger-warning-sexual-assault-child-abuse/td-p/282427
PTSD-1635,My fiancee hurts me *Trigger Warning - Domestic Violence*,"We had our engagement party over the weekend. My family were slow to leave and so I asked my fiancee to relieve the babysitter for our three year old and I would follow shortly. When I returned we argued and he hit me. Splitting my lip very badly. Our three year old son asleep in the next room. We have been together for 10 years and in that time he has physically hurt me three times First time he fractured my cheek. The second he gave me a black eye. Each time I have gone to my parents they have brushed it aside. I fear, as an overweight woman they feel I can do no better. I am smart woman, I know no one has the right to hurt me but I don't know what to do. I feel as if I am betraying myself. We also never have sex unless I initiate it. I have spoken to him several times to try to fix it and tell him that I feel unloved and lonely. Please. Somebody tell me I'm not the overbearing, horrible, undesirable woman I feel like I am.

PTSD-1636,What Is A Relationship *Trigger Warning - Child Abuse*,"Hello Beyondblue forum members, I am hear to seek advice from everyone that would like to share their insights onto relationships. First things, first, an introduction about me. I was one of the few millions of sperm that was able to swim into my mother's uterus and propagated with the egg. Jokes aside, I am 25 male (26 in a couple of months, cries) and have never really had a proper relationship. What do I mean by proper? I don't even know to be honest. My past experience was almost five years ago, where I dated this girl I met at university for three months, but then she moved to a different state and that was the end of that. I've never had any sexual activity in my life and my shrink have asked me if I am scared? I replied with, well if you had general anxiety and panic disorder would you be scared? Additionally, I was molested in my toddler years and I can remember that day pretty vividly. So I'm have some anxiety when connecting sexually. I am diagnosed with two medical conditions, general anxiety and panic disorder and to top that, I have personality traits in cluster B and C (Borderline personality and Avoidant personality disorder). To give you an idea what that means, I have extreme emotional response to abandonment, criticism, invalidation and rejection. I also have trouble reaching out physically to others for help, because inside I would like to be an independent person. Hooooraaay! One of my deepest desires is to connect with a female emotionally, as I do not have that with my mother. To be blunt, I feel like I am alone all the time. In additions to having BPD, I experiences extreme emptiness through my daily life and it can honestly be incredibly draining. I've accepted the fact I am not normal and that's okay. I was born with a hyper active nervous system where there are pros, which I am currently putting some effort into seeking. So here is one of my biggest issue with relationship besides getting into one, due to my personality traits which I have no control whatsoever, I often become obsessed with said person. Coming back to the extreme response to abandonment, my mind makes up scenario when this person may attempt to ""abandon"" me. It is a defensive mechanism to prevent me for attaining further possible pain. In addition to the intrusive thoughts, the anxiety can be crippling and it can honestly feel like dying is a better solution than to be in a relationship. In conclusion, I sabotage anything before it forms to anything.

PTSD-1637,Not coping anymore,Hi. I have no idea even where to start. Three years ago i left domestic violence. 3 Months after i was diagnosed with PTSD & depression. I also have an eating disorder which i have struggled with for years now. Ever since i left my ex partner it has been nothing still but severe stress. I have a four year old little girl. I have started to isolate myself more and more & shut people out. I don't think i have ever coped with motherhood either & the reality of being a single parent has really hit me hard lately. I am exhausted. Financial stress is wearing me down and the damage is leaving me feeling emotionally & mentally all over the place. I feel like i keep going backwards with everything. On a random good day it has been a good day but then it is back to the same hell in my head most days. I have no self esteem or confidence left. I don't enjoy the things i used to and genuinely don't enjoy life anymore. I hate most people and i hate myself so much for the choices i made. My daughter is the reason why i choose to keep going but every day is hell. I have had my daughter mostly full time within the last four years. I don't feel like anyone at all understands. I don't look after myself at all anymore nor do i even have the energy to be bothered. Most days i just want to run away or scream my head off. Does anyone else feel like they have lost themselves entirely and have no idea how to bounce back. I am seriously losing my shit more and more every day..... I keep reliving it in my mind all the time and remembering everything he did and said. I feel more anger than anything lately,NeedingSupport,Community Member,13-01-2018,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/not-coping-anymore/td-p/364638

PTSD-1639,Living with PTSD,"I havnt yet been diagnosed as well like most others I am absolutely uncomfortable talking to people in person about it. In 2013 I finally broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years. He was both physically and mentally abusive. Actually as I start to write this, I recognize he was also sexually abusive. After going to many dr's with him and him being treated for bipolar I was silly enough to stay for many years, It was bad but I didn't know another life I and suppose and I wasnt going to give up my pets for a crazy guy. I meet my now husband and things have been great. We have moved, and money wasnt great for a while which we faught about but we moved on and now lifes wonderful again. That is until he says something that my ex used to say (not in a nasty matter) and I lose it to the point, he finds me hiding on the floor crying. This is where I used to sit after my ex would be abusive. The police where called and there was AVO on my ex a few times. Now if there is argument, I hid under a blanket, run around the house closing curtains and bawl my eyes out saying the police will come. My husband honestly, is wonderful and his done 100% nothing wrong. But lately its like only taking 1 word to set it off. I am then tired and so drained for a day or 2 after it happens. I feel so bad for him, having to see me go like this. He is extremely supportive. My issue is I am not ready to discuss it face to face with anyone. And I know you should not diagnose yourself, but does it sound like PTSD ??? We live a wonderful life, live by the beach, no debt, great house and own our own business. Things honestly couldn't be better. Could being happy set PTSD off, like if your mind is relaxing can it like allow your mind to see things we dont.

PTSD-1640,First time disclosing sexual abuse,"Hi there Im new here although I've been visiting for a while. Long story short, I've realised that I'm a victim of sexual abuse and while I thought I'd dealt with it, a recent stressful period (unrelated to the abuse) has resulted in me really struggling. I really don't want to discuss the abuse with doctors etc and the truth is, besides one flash back, I've blocked it all out so I don't want to go digging it all up. Im also really scared talking to my doctor about it because I don't want to be fobbed off with a prescription and I don't even know how to start the conversation. Some days I'm fine, other days the stress (from things that previously wouldn't worry me too much) is paralysing. I've been unable to stop thinking about what happened to me besides when I'm really busy, so it's a bit of cycle. I'm having trouble sleeping too. I've been like this for about six months and I've been able to get some clarity and I now realise I've struggled with this my whole life but I don't understand why it's come up now and why I can't deal with it on my own like I usually do. I'm in my early thirties with a great family , friends, career etc and I've carried this myself since I was a kid. Im worried that if I don't seek professional help, I'll end up cracking but I'm also terrified to take the first step. I'm scared that by telling my doctor, somehow other people will find out. I've read various websites and tips for talking to the doctor but I hope that it will go away - whatever 'it' is - on its own. I don't consider myself depressed or anxious etc, but I do know I don't feel like myself a lot of the time. I'm not sure where to go from here.

PTSD-1642,Nightmares,"Hi everyone and Happy 2018, I haven't posted here in a little while because things have been going so well, I feel very lucky at the moment. My psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD after a long term abusive relationship. I managed to escape that relationship a year ago and have been going very well since and have managed to get through most of the physical and psychological issues I had from it One thing I can't seem to shake are my post traumatic nightmares. I dream about my ex trying to kill me, about the police raiding my home, about being terrified and physically hurt. Pretty much any event that happened in the past where I felt extreme fear, stress or pain- I dream about it. They happen a couple of times a week and more often when I sleep alone, my partner is a fifo worker and when he is home I don't seem to get them or if I do I don't remember them (my partner sometimes wakes me because I'm moving a lot or crying out) When I sleep alone they are so vivid and realistic that I wake up terrified and in a sweat. Has anyone had experience with nightmares? Anything work to get rid of them or at least make them less frequent? Open to any suggestions : ) Thanks!

PTSD-1643,Feeling like there is no way out,"Hi everyone its been awhile since I was on here. I had a huge nervous breakdown in 2015 following major stress & I am back in the same boat again. I recovered slowly back then it took me about 9 months to come through the worst of it but I made the mistake of going back to a busy life in 2016 my life partner left me for someone else because she wasn't happy I think because of my depression & trauma history as well as my kids & finacial pressures that tipped my world upside down & I had to move & find a way to earn a living. During that time I was experiencing massive health problems which led to major surgery earlier this year. I didn't have long to recover & had to get back to work to support my family. In August my beloved mother passed away suddenly leaving me to sort her affairs, funeral etc. & hold my family together. I then had to move house in October & when I moved my system flipped into another breakdown. I was triggered by being caught in an anger fit by a family member which tripped my brain into fight/flight & I haven't been able to turn it off. I had to move again to get away from the stress of where I moved too & I am now in a house, away from my community, my older son moved out so I am alone most of the time. I am deeply depressed & have no energy or interest in any of the things I used to do. I'm sure my adrenals have crashed & my nervous system is fried. My only ray of light at the moment is my friend supporting me & holding me through. At this stage I am feeling hopeless & like there is no way out of feeling this way. I have no appetite, barely any motivation to get up unless I am forced too.

PTSD-1644,Partner and her past sexual abuse [trigger warning],"Hi BB, I have been with my partner a couple of years and recently just had a little boy together. About 4 weeks out from meeting my son, my partner dropped some pretty sad information on me, that she had been abused as a child from the age of 2 by a family member and then gang raped by 3 men when she was 6 or 7 yrs old in PNG. She has depression and anxiety and we are working on getting a better diagnosis as Doctors believe she is suffering from more. I am not dealing well with things myself plus we have a little boy. Our son is well looked after and she a great mum but when it comes to everything else including us she is not able to handle it. I feel very alone as she zones off now and diasappears its seems. I touch her yesterday and she stated she feels gross when i touch her and look at her. Because she stated so many men have touched her she feels gross and uncomfortable when i do it. I can understand that. But im watching my relationship go down the drain.

PTSD-1645,Please help [trigger warning: domestic abuse],"Im 16, and since I was 4 years old, my dad has been very abusive. He doesn't hit me and my sister, although he is very aggressive. He treats my mother horribly however, when I was 4 I was standing right between them when he slapped/kicked her, that memory still bothers me. Earlier this year we moved out (my sister, me and mother) and lived on our own because he was getting overly abusive, but he would not leave us alone. He would park his car outside our house in the middle of the night, hop our fence and threaten us, etc. We had an order against him and his name and abuse has been recorded. A few months ago, my mother decided to move back in with him and try to fix things. It lasted for 2 weeks, then it all began again. The yelling, aggressiveness, lies, threats. He's stolen my money twice, taken pictures of my mothers bank card, and constantly withholds money. We are planning on leaving again, but there is mo way we could survive financially, we get welfare payments, but its only about $400...barley enough to pay rent and WiFi (for my school) and I just don't feel safe...i'm scared he will murder my mom, hurt us, etc, and even if w do get an order against him or send him for jail for the things he's done, i'm scared when he gets out he's going to find us. I'm just so lost and scared, this has been going on for forever, and i'm just so tired..can anyone give me advice on what to do?

PTSD-1646,Christmas woetide!,"I was diagnosed with PTSD after workplace incidences over 10 years ago and really haven't progressed since. My other family members I had to cut out of my life after last Christmas when my youngest brother who is 36 years old was again became violent towards me and threatened me after we were trying to have a discussion about him running up my mothers bills to $1400 a quarter and refusing to pay for them or any board whilst he was living there. My mother sat there and basically allowed him to attack me, bringing up things from when I first became sick years ago and how they all felt sorry for my daughter having a bad mum like me. I left when he threatened to kick my arse outside and my mother just told me to leave and it was my fault because I should have shut my mouth. When I got home, my mother rang me to remind me not to tell my aunt and uncle about my brothers behaviour as they and other extended family are unaware that for over 20 years he has been in and out of Youth Detention Centres and Remand centres for serious crimes for violence, drugs and burglaries. When another aunt died earlier this year who I was the closest to, my mother out of nastiness said I was not required at the funeral and then wonders why I will not speak to her as it was done out of pure nastiness. So for the past year I have had nothing to do with my family. I still send presents to each of the nieces and nephews and my daughter would still go to their birthdays when invited, even though I was not invited. My mother tends to play each child against the other, so my sister has cut me out of their lives believing that I have ignored my mother for no reason and are punishing her for our brothers behaviour. We have another brother who walked away from the family over ten years ago due to this other brother as well and it appears my mother would rather lose the 'decent' children than ask the troubled brother to leave. Fast forward to Christmas and my only daughter in her 20's has decided to spend Christmas with my family, leaving me home alone all day as she is too scared to say no to avoid trouble as they sent her nasty messages when she did not celebrate her birthday with them. I am deeply wounded and just feel like just running away as I feel like I am being punished for this time not accepting the family violence as in the past I have so they did not cut me off.

PTSD-1647,"Relationship Advice, Emotional Abuse?","I’m 17 years old, I have been diagnosed with social anxiety and depression. At the start of the year I began talking to a guy on online and we became close, he told me he was single, I later found out he wasn’t and I stopped all contact with him. He broke up with his girlfriend and sent me an apology, I ignored him but gradually we began talking again and about 3 months ago started dating. At first, I thought his attentiveness was sweet but it’s become a worry. He won't stop texting me, I have to talk to him until he falls asleep, if I don’t respond to a message straight away he freaks out, he rings me at 5:00 am and wakes me up, if I tell him I want some time to spend with my family he texts me non-stop and tells me I don’t care about him. I recently went out with a male friend he messaged me over 30 times and rang me 9 times in 2 hours, he was angry at me even though he goes out with his female best friend all the time. On Thursday I went out with my male friend, my boyfriend knew I was doing this and said he was fine with it. When I got home I rang my boyfriend as he wanted and he asked what I had done that day, I told him what we did including that I went to my friend’s house for about an hour. That evening I met up with my boyfriend to see a movie but instead he asked me to go to a nearby park with him, so he could eat before the movie began. On the way there he told me I dress like a slut and accused me of going off with other guys. When we got to the park he snapped, he accused me of not telling him that I had been to my friend’s house. I told him that I did tell him, and he said, “but you didn’t ask my permission” I asked how it was any different to him seeing his female friend and he told me “it’s different”. He was yelling at me so I wanted to leave. When I tried to, he grabbed my bag and phone and pulled it off me, he then grabbed hold of my wrists with force. I am petite he is big, I was scared and began crying, he started to hug me and he told me he was sorry, he “didn’t mean it”, “he’d had a bad day” he then gave me a gift. Things have been tense but yesterday he went to a GP to seek help, and was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, bi-polar disorder and multiple personality disorder, I am a bit doubtful of this as he has a past history of lying. He keeps telling me he loves me and will change. I think I have become dependent on him and am scared to be without him but also I am scared to be with him.

PTSD-1648,Abusive ex has applied for a DVO,Hi all. I went through a BU 3 months ago. Having had much counselling I came to realise he was emotionally abusive resulting in me losing confidence & self esteem. 2 weeks ago he took out a temp protection order and DVO against me as we had an argument in which there was a scuffle and as I was emotionally hurting some horrible language. I have been temporarily stopped from attending a social swim group until court date in late January. I am anxious and feel I am being manipulated into leaving the shared swim group which has supported me through the BU. Legally there are options but fighting it will cost thousands and Ican't afford it.

However I feel it hard to turn to anybody else and I'm hoping someone can give me some insight.. I'm 33, married for almost 9 years, but this relationship has never been smooth sailing. He used to be very possessive, arrogant, domineering, he loses his temper and puts me down. Yes it has gotten better but still happens. I now have 2 kids, and we have a pretty big mortgage as I'm not yet back to work- hopefully next year. So finance has become a HUGE issue in our relationship along with in law issues which in turn has created us to both withdraw from each other. I'm so confused and alone and so not feeling wanted.

PTSD-1650,Slipping back for another reason,"Hi. Havent posted for quite sometime , but right now just feel I need to vent a bit. Thought a past incident had been buried, but the anger over how it was managed by my imediate manager has resurfaced. So here goes. 18 months or so ago I was involved in a critical incident at work on the road when I came across a near fatal accident as a community nurse. Its taken time, psychologist x2(I changed) and treatment to get over this, and the waves of panic whenI see ambulances with sirens/ lights are decreasing. At the time of the incident I was not offered critical incident debriefing (though my incident report claimed I got it), and my unit manager didnt really acknowledge this as a stressful event for me. Fast forward 12 months, new unit manager now, and aggression towards health care workers campaign/community education well underway. A patient I visited at home was verbally agressive towards me, yelling at me, offloading how unhappy she was with our service. I can put up with rude patients, and am an experienced nuurse, but this really upset me at the time. I reported it to the office when it happened, and filled in an incident report. When I met with my manager I requested she ring the patient and explain that this is not acceptable behavour ( not an unreasonable request? To show support to me?) She didnt think it necessary! and left it to the next nurse visiting the next day to raise the incident with the patient All I was offered was EAP counselling, which I declined as I was seeing my psycholigist . We are still seeing this pt,at home, I have been there once since, while she was pleasant, I felt uneasy , but trying to move on. So last week a general email is sent out to all hospital staff from the CEO outlining agression managent and how every incident will be treated as cat.1 or 2 now , and the staff involved will be sent a letter of support from the CEO. among other things. I just feel that theres policies made to look good but the reality to me is, they are not followed. Just feeling this incident has blown up again in my face. Taking a few days off work now. Being kind to myself , just feeling I need to vent now and get support. sorry for the long tirade!",bear53,Community Member,10-12-2017,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/slipping-back-for-another-reason/td-p/293755
PTSD-1651,"Emotionally abusive husband, possibly NPD or Asperger's","Married 8 years, young when we married (22) & early on in our relationship he would drink a lot & often get angry with me, be verbally abusive telling me he hated me & regretted marrying me (often done in front of friends and/or family) & walk out and be missing for 18+hrs & returning home and expecting everything to be fine. I would tell him how is actions hurt me & he would make it out like it was my fault in the first place or totally shut me down and belittle me for feeling that way, like I had no right. This stopped & he rarely drinks now & we've been doing very well and for the most part been really happy. He is very focused on saving and getting setup for life, hoping to retire before 50 (this is a target we've agreed on together). I went away for the weekend with a girl friend of mine, a trip we make evey year, before leaving we had spoken about the use of our joint account for spending with me stating any money taken from savings would be repaid, on my return he was very distant & the next day he told me he was unhappy with how much money I had spent & that he felt like I had betrayed him & I might as well have cheated on him. He then told me he had already packed a bag & was leaving me to go to a hotel as he didn't want to be around me and was no longer sure if he wanted to be with me anymore. A few days later I asked him to come home so we could talk, he told me I could have 1 hour of his time. When he arrived I told him I thought the whole thing was an overreaction as I'd said all money would be returned & I couldn't understand why he left. I asked him to stay & let me repay the money, he told me he didn't trust me & didn't know what he wanted, and left.We barely spoke over the next few days & I spent the next week coming to terms with the fact he had left me. I returned to work the following week.I returned home from work that evening to find him sitting in our living room like nothing happened. I was really angry. He had put his motorcycle away in the garage to hide the fact he was home and was expecting me to be pleased with his little 'surprise' homecoming. I told him how much walking out on me again had hurt me and he basically told me it was all my fault and I deserved it, and that I had no right to be angry at him.

PTSD-1652,Triggers from the past *Trigger Warning:Sexual Assault*,"So this is always a hard subject to tell anyone . And was one of the hardest things I have ever done . It was to tell someone about when I was molested . So I’m a guy and buy being a male I already feel like I have failed by writing this , like I should be strong and have no problems, it’s actually quite embarrassing to be honest . Long story short when I was in year 7 or 8 a guy at my school in year 12 continually grabbed me at least 10 times and shoved his hands up my shirt to grab my man boobs , whilst making inappropriate movements towards me. He would squeeze me so tight that I couldn’t move , I would just freeze unable to do anything afraid he would get violent .I was a chubby kid and was always so scared of this guy and tried to avoid him. Growing up I only believed he was a bully however when you get older and reflect on things , you can see clearer and understand that this has seriously impacted me , yea he never touched my genitals but to me he still affected my self image even to this day I struggle with that . And even that in it self is a struggle because I feel there are much more worse of people then me , people get raped and here I am trying to say how hard I have had it ..... I can usually just not think about what happened , because it makes me angry , however I have a new problem . When me and my girlfriend get intimate there can sometimes be problems she will just be loving and sometimes you know accidentally touch my nipples . I instantly take her hands away from them and it wrecks the mood completely . “it happened so long ago “ “ are you sure it even happened “ “ it’s not even that bad “ . Is what is usually said. I know it’s not her fault but that just makes me feel even worse . The problem I have is I don’t want to accept the fact that I am a victim and I don’t want the stigma that society associates men who have been abused will abuse. I know I need to work on things but I think writing this here is a positive step , and it makes me feel good that I can vent , because I feel I can’t ever do that",Dan-,Community Member,28-11-2017,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/triggers-from-the-past-trigger-warning-sexual-assault/td-p/359711

PTSD-1654,How Do You Trust Again When Your Soul Is Crushed?,"Today I find myself racked with fear & anxiety. Thoughts plague my heart, unrest eats at my soul as the question goes over & over in my mind.... What if there is no one out there who I can really trust? How do I know that people are who the say they are, who they portray themselves to be? How do you know, how can you be sure, when everyone, every authority, every supposedly ""safe place "" has betrayed or abused my trust- be it the Dr & radiologist who sexually abused me at age 5 or my parents who didn't make home a safe place, rather a war zone. My family who lied to me on many occasions, the bosses that took advantage of me & the boss who was violent, the church that abandoned me in my darkest hour because I'm not a VIP! My friends who promised to keep in touch but I haven't heard from in 8 years, all the friends that abandoned me when I told them I had PTSD & depression. So many people I trusted that turned out not to be who I thought. So many peoples words, that didn't mean what they said. My whole life feels like one big lie! It's not a safe place when you have no one you can trust! I get not everyone will like me or want to be my friend. I'm not everyone's cup of tea. I'm totally ok with that! What hurts is when people pretend! All I want is for people to say what they mean & mean what they say! Don't pretend to be my friend if you don't really mean it! Don't say you will do things if you have no intentions of putting actions to your words. If you're going to hurt, hurt me with the truth-not with lies! I need to know there's someone who I can trust. Someone authentic, genuine, sincere. Someone who is who they appear to be. Someone who ONLY says what they mean & means what they say! It's so soul destroying to live in a place where you can't trust, that doesn't feel safe.

PTSD-1655,How to help? *Trigger Warning: Child Abuse*,"Hi all, A warning. Abuse here is as bad as it gets. It involves an unrepentant and unprosecuted incestuous paedophile father who still is manipulative and controlling of his family over a decade after the physical abuse finished. I'm trying to support my ex but I'm terrified I'll do something wrong as my instincts don't align with the way she lives with her controlling abuser and refuses to confront him, until last night. The abuse she both suffered and witnessed happening to her younger brothers left every night a nightmare for the almost 20 years since the 4 years of abuse. Almost every time she fell asleep near me she would jolt her self awake while whimpering in the sickness of those nightmares. I want him to rot a jail cell. But I don't understand the cultural background of her family. Being from a Muslim Bangladeshi heritage with her family still heavily involved with the community makes dealing with the abuse so much harder for her and the family. But over the last few months she has gained strength as she found a new job that will take her away and had for the first time ever opened up to a therapist (only person other than me she has been fully honest about the abuse with) Now recently she found her dad cheating on her mum. I can't begin to know how to probe these emotions. She views her mum as both a savior or maybe more fellow inmate/survivor but I also know the immense if unstated disappointment that she never spotted the abuse though she is sure she knew. I know she feels responsible for her though. When she found out annoy the cheating she confronted him for the first time ever, I don't know what this means and I don't want to just be pushing my agenda to punish the man for his crimes. I want what best for her but I also believe taking that man out of the family is best for all but they are so ingrained in their community I think they think it represents social suicide for them. Please how do I be there for her? Do I suggest action? Every ounce of me wants to fight. I want to shake her and say that man is ruining your family's life. But I can only support the actions she chooses. Please I don't know what to do here. Help.

PTSD-1656,Why would a mother not care how her child feels and just apologise what happened to me? *Trigger Warning: Sexual Abuse* ,"What would you do? I am in mid 40s and I wanted to know what would you do in this circumstances? My father molested me and my two siblings when we were 5 years old and over. My siblings don't care about it and they don't blame my mother. They are very controlling and are narsisic personality. I left home when I was 16 because mum won't put a lock on my door because my memories came back and I told her I was scared of dad coming into my room. My dad still lived in the house until he left her when I was 22 years old. I moved out when I was 16 as mum wouldn't put a lock on my room. She has never apologized till now. We go through ups and downs when I see her not caring about my feelings of what happened. She will always give me a blank look or look at me like I am lying. She denied it at first then my brother said to mum stop lying. I also saw my mum when I was five years old looking at what my dad did and not say anything. My point to this is my dad just recently passed away and my mum went to his funeral with my brother and sister and also traveled out of their way to put all his ashes overseas etc. I told her I didn't want her to go to his funeral and she went then I said I didn't want her to go overseas to drop his ashes, and she did go. I told her I felt she was unloyal to me and still think what he did was correct. So since the funeral, I have avoided my mum and not talking to her much, and vice versa. It hurts me to see she has no care in the world to fix this. My mum is 74. I have helped her in so many ways in the last 15 years, getting good prices and deals for her medical, specialist etc, and have been going out of my way to help her in everything. I spend time with her once a week and go lunch, do her shopping etc. I have stopped all helping since the funeral. My mum never left my dad, he left her eventually. It hurts me so much and when I tell her she gives me a sarcastic face or a face like I am stupid, or just stares in blankness.

PTSD-1657,Road Trauma *Trigger Warning*,"First of all I will give a brief description as to who I am and what I do so you can get an understanding of what it's like to work on the front line at scenes. I am a volunteer with the State Emergency Service and have been for 24 years. About 15 of these were spent attending road accidents with Rescue. There has only been one incident that has really affected me and that was on the night of the 10th / 11th Jan 2010. At 10pm my pager and phone had a message come through MVA persons trapped 20 km North of my location. I flew into rescue mode and was out the door within 5 minutes and at the depot within 7 minutes. As we arrived on scene, a message from my unit at the time came across the police radio that they had just arrived on scene. I gave it no more thought as mine was a fatal and we had to work as quick as we can to get the other critically injured out of the vehicle. By the time we had finished and reopened the highway it was about 2:20am. After a quick service of the tools and a debrief, I finally got home around 3am. I had 3 messages from my mum so I rang her back pulling her out of bed. She told me to sit as she had some news to tell me. She broke the news that I had lost a good mate and his son in a double just out of town that night, then it hit me, (the message on the radio) As I was talking to mum trying to hold back the tears, I had a knock at my door. I told mum I would ring her back through the day as I need to see who's knocking. When I opened the door, there stood 2 police officers, the same 2 that had just come back from the accident I was called to. Just the expression on their faces I knew they got a shock to see me in my blood stained uniform which made their job even harder. I told them that I had just found out what they were there for and would they like to come in and have a coffee with me. They told me to ring the station when I got a chance to if I wanted to know more as they knew who I was since I've worked beside them many times on the roads. I got a shock to know how it was caused and what the other driver blew at the time of the accident. Both accidents that night were caused by drink drivers. I not only had 3 fatals to deal with but the fact I had just lost my good mate twice as he was brought back the first time then finally went in the helicopter on the way to hospital.

PTSD-1658,Trauma and eroding events,"Hi, I'm new to BB but have so far learned that I can't post descriptions of trauma because it might make someone else sad. I respect that but I think it's sometimes helpful to discuss what has happened. I've experienced a number of significant traumatic events in my childhood and adolescence. But when you're already traumatised, it seems to me, some otherwise innocuous events can cause further damage. I call these eroding events because I don't know the psych term for it. For example, as the youngest of 3 children I copped a lot of teasing from my older siblings and this added to my problems. Bullying at work eventually made it impossible for me to continue and I retired early. It was like I carried a big sign on my back - I'm different, so a good target. It was perplexing to me that other staff had time to gossip and spread rumours, and how quickly those rumours spread like the mycelium of a fungus. Besides the anxiety, I'm bipolar and a number of other ageing illnesses. I'm on so many pills I rattle when I walk.

Im feeling really fragile tonight. I paid money to have something made for/of my brother. A paid a lot of money, the first one I got done was of my mum and my step dad, the second one of my brother. The first one arrived, the second one has not. I know people say that objects don't mean as much memories but when someone you love passes away, you do cherish the memories but the objects are also the things that remind me of him. The first picture arrived in June. I asked the lady where the picture of my brother was and she said it was on the way, I haven't seen it yet and she blocked me. Its so upsetting knowing you trusted someone to open up a little bit, I told them what my brother loved doing, sent them photos and I got nothing in return. My heart is broken because it was something I felt so... not excited, but something I really longed to have and now it's gone and I'm feeling upset I don't have that momento of my brother I thought I would.

PTSD-1661,I'm not coping well,"to start off with, I am very much an animal person and have always been around them. About 5 days ago i was driving home the same way i always do. i wasn't speeding or distracted but out the side of my eye i saw a blur and then felt my car go over something, when i looked in the revision mirror i saw the most beautiful black and white cat pulling itself off the road. it had hit my back wheel and the wheel had crushed its back legs. i burst into tears and pulled over straight away. by the time i got out of the car this older man and a girl had stopped as well. the poor cat was in excrusiating pain, trying to move away from me but was unable to.it was gasping for air and whining. i couldn't stop crying and couldn't breathe properly. all that pain had been inflicted by me. i ran to my car and grabbed a towel and the older man helped me wrap the cat up. by this time my mum had arrived because i knew i was in no state to drive. i sat in the back of the car with the cat who was shaking and gasping for air. the poor cat stopped making the whining sounds about two minutes away from the vet and i started to freak out but when i got out mum said she saw it move so i thought we could save her/him. the vet rushed the cat out the back and we waiting. she finally came out and said the cat had died. i have never felt so guilty and terrible in my whole life. i am the reason this poor cat is dead and i feel as though i cannot forgive myself. i keep thinking what might have happened if i had left 2 minutes later, or if i swerved or braked more. i feel sick all the time, i feel unmotivated and i have such a negative frame of mind. i know i did everything i could to help but i feel as though there is so much more i should have done. i killed an innocent animal.",hjh,Community Member,13-11-2017,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-m-not-coping-well/td-p/325719
PTSD-1662,Trigger Warning - Sexual Assault: 26 years and still not treated,"I wish this was a sick twisted tale, but i lived it. Why? In the summer of 1989/90, just turned 12, I left a primary school in the isolated hills of Tasmania, of 40 students total, prep to year 6. To start my first day at a highschool on the far outskirts western Sydney, in Penrith, with 2000 + students. Leaving behind a family of 8,myself being the youngest of 6, the family had almost disintegrated overnight. My parents took the opportunity to dissolve their marriage, and split their responsibilities between the two remaining dependants. My father taking my older brother of 15 to brisbane and my mother taking myself to penrith, to live with her girlfriend. Being an effeminate naive and trusting 12 year old boy going on 9, in a city that moved faster than anything i had ever seen before, I quickly become the target of deciet and harassment, both physically and verbally. To top it of, my mums new partner hated males and found the perfect victim in my submissive nature. To cut a long story short, i was beaten all day at school and all night at home. Until i met this girl, who showed me how to escape. Simply put, i would tell school i was going to be abscent because of family events and tell my mum i was going on a school excersion, then we would go to Sydney and noone would be none the wiser. So, now 14, standing in kings cross, my girlfriend decides she needs to confront an old boyfriend in a nightclub, but she wants me to come with her. So she has this great idea for me to go drag, which totally works, more than anticipated.

On the occasions where I have described my PTSD symptoms, cognitive issues, and the event the led up to it, the reaction is usually negative in the sense that I stigmatize myself as some kind of loser, and fail to get any understanding. So what I do now is that I don't explain it at all, and I cover up my PTSD to the best of my ability. Most of my friends and acquaintances have no idea that I have PTSD. If I meet someone new somewhere, I just tell them lies (not elaborate ones) that I have a job and a normal life. Because the result of telling the truth makes me more marginalized than I am now.

I was international news for a few days and everyone was heaping praise on me for the outcome. They have all moved on to the next thing to talk about and , on the surface, so have I. Under the surface though I'm not doing so well. The incident happened recently where i came across a crashed car in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere. Inside was a man trapped and the car on fire. While the outcome was good, my mind keeps replaying the preceeding 10 minutes where there were moments I genuinely thought i was about to watch someone who was perfectly aware of his surroundings and begging for my help get burnt alive. Every time I let my mind idle just a bit it goes to replaying those moments and every time i drive past that spot at night I have to focus very hard on something, anything to stop me going in to a full blown panic attack thinking I'm going to have to go through it again. Getting professional help out here is nearly impossible unless you are suicidal and even then you usually have to wait.

PTSD-1667,PTSD anxiety and depression are devastating enough to live with,"Every day is a struggle to stay healthy and, to be frank, keep going. The worst thing about PTSD anxiety and depression is the stigma. I live in a rural area (New England region) and several times in the last 12 years I have been admitted - or admitted myself - to hospital out of immediate fear of my safety. My last 3 encounters with the local mental health department have seen outrageously disrespectful, rude and downright abusive treatment from certain people 'in charge'. In some cases these 'professionals' have failed me by simply not doing their job... making things impossibly hard for me. When I was hospitalised a few years ago as a result of domestic violence - not a single person asked me about domestic violence. I was not even permitted to talk to the police about it from hospital. After release from hospital, the police asked me why I hadn't contacted them earlier! Almost 4 years later and I cannot go out in my local town for fear of the bloke who got away with it. Another time, they would not let me make a phone call to get a friend to check on my dog. I was desperately distressed... worrying about my dog and being treated like a criminal with one phone call made everything far worse. When I tried to leave so I could make a call from a public phone ( I was there voluntarily), they refused to give me any of my property or my car keys. I am a very quiet, reserved softly-spoken person. I am well educated and articulate. I am polite to a fault. I have never assaulted anyone. Never been in trouble with the law. My main problems with PTSD anxiety and chronic depression are the result of me being the VICTIM of violence/abuse. However,in every interaction with hospital-based mental health in the Armidale/Tamworth area I have been treated like dangerous criminal scum! It has been made clear to me, by the implication of so-called professionals' failures to bother to do their job, that the violence I experienced MUST have been ALL MY FAULT... I MUST have done SOMETHING to deserve the abuse. Consistently, I have been made to feel unwelcome and worthlessly undeserving of assistance. Breaks my heart. Makes the feelings of isolation, constant fear and worthlessness worse. I no longer see the local mental health service or local hospital as viable or safe options for dealing with crises when they occur. There is literally nowhere else to go, but I desperately need help... Stigma kills and I'm feeling there is no hope either for me or for change.

PTSD-1668,Struggling to come to terms with serious car accident,"I was involved in a very serious car accident about 6 weeks ago and I'm struggling to cope with the thoughts that run through my head 24/7.

I can't sleep anymore, I get images of myself in the car and no one can get me out and everyone is standing around looking at me but no one is helping and I'm screaming and in pain. I find that little things startle me so much and I've forgotten so many details of what happened even though I was conscious for the whole event. I'm getting so angry because everyone I reach out to for help seems to think I'm just absolutely fantastic because my physical injuries have healed and everyone keeps telling me I'm lucky...but I don't feel it. I feel so stressed and anxious I won't let anyone else in my car because I'm afraid I'll hurt them and I spend hours staring at the pictures of the accident trying to undo it or punish myself for what I've done. I've always been anxious but this is a whole new level and I'm having panic attacks literally everywhere, in the shower, in bed just remembering the small things I actually remember from the accident.

PTSD-1669,Keep moving forward!,"Someone else is always worse off than me I keep telling myself. You see it every day in the news! I think I am typing this as it helps me clear my mind somewhat. I am 41 years old now, have 3 beautiful boys, but sadly I have had to say goodbye to one child a number of years ago, and then goodbye to my wife almost 2 and a half years ago. We lost her in the most tragic of circumstances while on a family getaway. Such a beautiful, healthy young woman with nothing but love for life and for her family and friends. We tried to keep her alive, doctors, nurses and paramedics were and are amazing, and they truly don't get the recognition they deserve. I have seen things I never wanted to see, made decisions I have never wanted to make. Its strange you know. People have often said that they don't know how I have dealt with things or how I have coped. The true reason is, what alternative is there? You either cope and maybe there will be days ahead where something happens and it makes you smile or laugh, or your kids make you so proud, or simply the warm sun shines on your face and you realise there is much to look forward to. There is no alternative but to cope. Try and love life I say!",Keep_on_running,Community Member,30-10-2017,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/keep-moving-forward/td-p/298710
PTSD-1670,Trigger warning: Hold up situation + suicide of a friend.,"Hi all I am a 23 year old girl with some issues. My Ptsd started after a horrible situation at work.I am a cashier and I was going about my normal day. It was busier than usual. I turned around and a man was standing next to me with a gun at my hip. I looked at him so confused and then down at the gun. He said to me ""I am not f**king around, open the till"" So I did and he grabbed the money and ran out. Hardly anyone noticed what had happened. I was so scared I almost wet myself. I lent over my till and cried. I had heaps of support, my family and my amazing boyfriend are so good with it, but I found it hard getting back to work. They started docking my pays and I had to go back. Councillors didnt seem to help much so I went without. In the middle of last year one of my friends commited suicide. I find this very hard to talk about because it literally breaks my heart. He was a kind gentle soul, and I think about him every single day. I am a wreck, its been a year since the hold up and 6 months since my friend left this earth. I am hurting still. I am very clingy with my family and boyfriend. I dont go out much/only if i have too. I have put on weight which I cannot stand. I have no motivation to do anything. I cry sometimes for no reason and I am always scared. I cant even get up at night to go to the toilet because I am so petrified of being alone in the dark. If my dog barks, I flip out. I will stare out the window for like half an hour. Honestly I feel as though work just wanted me back asap, how do people put a time frame on someone who is healing from these things. I am just struggling. With sleep, with work, with myself. I am getting help now but im still at the same work place, I really just don't want to be there. I am so sorry for rambling on, just any tips on how to cope would be more than appreciated xx",beb7,Community Member,04-01-2017,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trigger-warning-hold-up-situation-suicide-of-a-friend/td-p/261294

PTSD-1673,Alcohol addiction and emotional abuse,"Well here I am in the midst of trying to rebuild my marriage after discovering my husbands depression had spiralled into alcohol, medication and porn addiction. I have trolled the internet for answers and help and have come upon the subject of emotional abuse. All sites deal with the more severe aspects but what if the emotional abuse has been so subtle its almost undetectable? Its only been through reading up that I realise I have been a victim. Firstly, when he was home he pretty much ignored me then would turn up with flowers or buy me something expensive. He constantly made jokes about everything I said or did. If we were out he would ignore me and if I approached him or found ourselves face to face he'd laugh and say ""you still here?"" If I watched one of my TV programs he'd sit there through the whole thing making silly comments until I turned it off then he'd act all hurt and tell me he was only joking. Anything I wanted to do was quickly discarded in favour of an activity he preferred. While he was away from home he would send messages often with a derogatory pet name for me (boofhead was his favourite) He would ignore my requests to help with anything, never consider my feelings in decisions he made and made light of our situation when I tried to talk about his obvious alcohol abuse. Its taken me a lot to realise and admit to myself that I am a victim of emotional abuse and now I have yet another thing to add to the very long list of stuff for me to work through.

PTSD-1675,Guilt for not going to the police *TRIGGER WARNING: SEXUAL ABUSE*,"Trigger Warning: Sexual Abuse My first memory was my father walking into the lounge picking up my older sister and taking her to the bedroom while my sister screamed she was 4 i was 3 our mum had just went to the store to get milk.. As you can imagine what was happening it was horrible one day mum walked in and saw what happened she packed our bags took us to our nans she went to the police but they told her to wait until we were older because they thought we were to young to be in court, at that point mum contacted dhs and they helped us with short term therapy and legal help for custody battles. But it didnt help we moved from house to house and dad always found us, but more issues had started when i was 4 my eldest brother 9 years older made me his target as well. threatening me saying if i dont submit he would use my younger sister instead(2) being young and afraid i didnt know what to do knowing i hated what was happening and how wrong it was but to scared to tell my mum, would she believe me? Well it turns my silence was for nothing she found him raping my sister at the age of 6 though i didnt find this out until years passed, she sent my brother to counseling and made him live with nan .. So at age 8 i was free, well at least until 13 when my brother came back i understand my mum thought he was better after years of counselling. nobody wants to believe their child is a monster. I was again ashamed and scared again constant disgust not wanting to admit what happened in fear of being told im lying or worse being told its my fault. At 16 my brother left again and a few months later my stepdad called me a lazy asshole like my bro and i broke down saying id never be like that monster when my mum came home she made me talk to her explain of course she cried saying sorry she didnt know and explained how she found him and sent him to counseling and she didnt know it was happening to me at all, and that she would have got me help. from that day none of my family talk to him and that day i ran away looking for a place with no memories now at 19 im engaged i have a great relationship with both my mum and other siblings but i also have a son hes 7 weeks old tomorrow and i feel constant guilt knowing that those vile humans are out there and im not trying to stop them cause im to afraid to see them in court i am guilty for not saving other kids for not protecting my own, i dont know what to do",Hidden_secrets,Community Member,17-10-2017,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/guilt-for-not-going-to-the-police-trigger-warning-sexual-abuse/td-p/331480

PTSD-1678,Broken neck vs broken heart,"I broke my neck in a snowboarding accident 6 months ago. I damaged several vertebrae and have plates and titanium screws fused into my spine using a bone graft from my hip. To look at me you wouldn't even know, unless you saw my scars or my skeleton on my CT scans. My heart and spirit also broke that day. With the help of my family and friends I am slowly building my strength back up but I feel like a lesser version of myself. I was told not to snowboard for a year, if ever. Bittersweet is the best word to describe it. I am so lucky. My doctors said I tempted fate. Lucky to be alive, lucky to be walking. For 5 months I was a ticking time bomb. 24 hours changed and saved my life forever. Some days I look at my scars with pride and other days I want to scream. I feel weak, like my body let me down. How could I not know I had broken my back?! I am scared to do simple things that I didn't even question before. Every twinge or ache takes me right back.

PTSD-1679,Should I admitt myself?,"First post. Feeling like my anxiety and depression are so bad that I'd need to be admitted in a psych ward. But I'm so scared I'll lose my 14 year old son. I have PTSD from losing my him for 16mths. FACS lied to me and tricked me into signing something that gave them permission to take custody of him. All for nothing. I have always been the best mum and have always gone above and beyond for him. We both suffered a lot and continue to suffer because of it, even though I've had him back for a few years. That has contributed to the state that I'm currently in. If I go to hospital FACS will be told right away. They never actually admitted that they were wrong about me. So in my files it will say that we had a dysfunctional family blah blah blah. All completely fabricated but no way to prove it. If I lost him again I dont know what I'd do. Just the thought of it sends me into panic attacks. My son is intellually disabled. His father took off when he found out I was pregnant. My son and I have such a close bond. That's why he suffered so much when he was taken. I'm so scared. My mental state is so bad that I haven't answered my phone in months. I keep expecting the police to show up at my door because non of my son's services can get a hold of me. I stopped going out and dont open my curtains. I know that my parenting is suffering because my son isn't getting the services he needs but I just can't make any phone calls at all. Anyone with severe anxiety would understand. Apart from that, he is spoilt and recieves non stop love. He is my world. Im just really desperate for intensive therapy. But I'm too scared to let anyone know how bad I am right now. I have no family or friends. I feel very alone in this. I can't stop crying. I never know how to pull myself together. I've had such an incredibly hard life. It's really taken it's toll.

PTSD-1683,Emotional Abuse,"Hey guys, I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips on how to eject yourself from an emotionally abusive relationship that seems to never end. I have been with this person for almost two years and yet not for one second did it feel secure - this person would have bursts of good energy where he wanted to be around me all the time, be affectionate and caring and take interest in me, and then suddenly he would snap to ignoring me for weeks and being completely uninterested. This person showed absolutely no care factor for me or my life, yet expected me to be there to support him in every aspect of his and worship him at his feet basically. I have received countless insults that have damaged my self esteem to it's core, yet never received any form of apology as i was always framed as sensitive or over reacting. Whenever I tried to discuss my feelings or these issues, my attempt was met with anger and contempt and he refused to engage in any form of self reflection or discussion. Recently he decided he wanted to stop seeing me, making it known to me that he does not care about me and stated that i'm annoying etc etc. I was heart broken after this, and yet four days later he returned by messaging me saying he misses me and acting as if nothing had happened. I'm so deeply confused, and because I love this person I always forgive his behaviour and go back to him, as he claims to ""not remember"" the things he says, and also says that he doesn't mean half the things he says. I am desperate for help on how I can save myself from this cycle, so please if anyone has had any similar experiences, please share them with me, thanks!",ashrosee,Community Member,25-09-2017,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/emotional-abuse/td-p/336732

PTSD-1685,PTSD and Identity,"Hi, I am actually new here so i am trying this for the first time. I have PTSD as a result of child abuse. It was a long road to recovery but i got there. Now as it stands i have a Degree in Social Welfare and i am currently doing a Masters Degree in Mental Health Practice. Despite my recovery and educational background i am finding that when people (even of academic class) find out i have a mental illness i get a lot of comments from people suggesting i don't continue my studies in case i am triggered. Some even suggest that i cannot work in mental health because i have an illness and everyone will think i take it all to personally. Some people roll their eyes and shrug of what i say like it is not a fact because i have an illness therefore nothing i say is a fact. Not everyone does this, a lot of people support me as well. My question i guess is does anyone else struggle with this? right now i am second guessing my pathway to a PHD because i have been dealing with a negative environment lately. Maintaining an education and an illness is hard work and i sometimes struggle with my identity because of it. I guess right now it feels like no matter how hard i try my illness dictates my identity regardless of my hard work or sense of self. I found myself wondering if there is even a point trying to pursue education or normal functioning if people are going to treat me based off my mental illness not as myself. jess.",jessica4,Blue Voices Member,30-08-2017,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-and-identity/td-p/335196
PTSD-1686,INVISIBLE WALL OF FEAR,"Hello, So I am constantly writing my thoughts out in my journal and thought instead of doing that tonight, maybe I should write to someone who might understand what I am going through. Basically, I am stuck. Everything was going well for me until mid last year when I ""lost my marbles"" so to speak. I had severe panic attacks, kept running away (I'm married and I'm almost 30 years old might I add) suicide attempts etc - literally, everything I knew about myself had changed. I had PTSD & depression in my teens but I thought I had it all under control. I know I have anxiety and depression amongst other diagnosed illness's. This time last year, I was starting to get back on top of things, I eventually went back to work and started to feel like myself again. And then its changed AGAIN. Fast forward 9 months and I am stuck. I have stopped seeing my Psychologist, I don't like leaving the house without my wife, she's definitely my safety blanket and I have stopped going to work. Because of all of this, we are financially strained, my wife is constantly on the watch incase I have a ""Eve 24 or 48"" which is basically after I have a panic attack, I shut down and don't talk or try and run away into the night and this can last up to a couple of days. I hate this about myself and I know that the right thing to do is to get back to work, see my psychologist and all the other obvious strategies. But I just can't seem to push past this invisible wall of fear and avoidance and it is crippling not only myself but my family too. Theres obviously more to my story but I will leave it at that.

PTSD-1687,Losing a loved one,"My Grandfather and I were extremely close. The relationship I had with him was stronger than any of the relationships I have with any of my other family members. The bond between us was unbreakable. If I was having a crap day, his presence was all I needed in order to make things better. Two months ago, I watched him as he passed away. I was just a few houses down when I heard screaming I had to come back. I got back into the room and everyone was silent, the nurses told us he could still hear us and told us to talk to him, what on earth are you supposed to say? I knew he couldn’t respond, but I still waited for him to open his eyes and answer me. I didn’t want to let go of him. They told us this day was coming, he was very ill. I had convinced myself that he would make it, that everyone coming to visit and crying was just unnecessary and confronting for him. I had spent the whole day with him the day that he passed. It hurt seeing him laying there, clearly in pain, just looking around at everyone in the room, helpless. I literally walked out of the room for 5 minutes, and that’s when I got called back in. It happened so quickly. I hated myself for not being there. About 30 mins before he passed, I was sitting beside him. It was as if something was telling me I needed to take a picture of him. I had to do it. I pulled my phone out and snapped a sneaky picture. No one knew at the time, and no one knows now that I still have the photo. I never would have thought that this would be the last picture of him, minutes before he passed. It hurts. There is not a single day that goes by that I don’t think about him. He was the only one who could make me feel better about myself and the things going on around me. With life's struggles, I don’t know who to turn to. I feel like I’ve been left alone, in some sort of hole. I don’t want to talk to family about it and I honestly feel better just being alone. My mood has definitely changed and I have become a lot more carefree than what I used to be. I’ve tried talking but it doesn’t seem to get me far. Sleeping has also become a lot more difficult for me. No matter how hard I try to relax before bed, constant thoughts running through my head keep me up until the early hours of the morning. Any suggestions on how to get my life back on track would be greatly appreciated. Thank you xx P.S: I apologise if this has brought back any negative memories for anyone.

As a child my father was verbally abusive to us kids and physically abusive to my mother, I have learned never to speak back to anyone and have often been taken advantage of throughout my life. I have always been withdrawn socially and unable to make friends or maintain meangingful relationships with others. I have always isolated myself and moved interstate many times as a coping mechanism to feeling alone which has made me feel more alone. My family lives on the other side of the country and I never hear from any of them except my mother who I have an unstable relationship with. I have no support system. My first job out of university I was 'forced' to do things that gave me extreme anxiety and I did not feel comfortable with because thats the way it was there and there was no one else to do them (in healthcare). I ended up leaving due to sheer stress and moving on to my second job where I also resigned at breaking point due to extreme workplace bullying and harassment. I have used drugs to cope with my feelings of sadness (especially since the bullying incident) and now find it hard to not 'numb my feelings' by using. This year I was in a serious car accident and more recently I was in a relationship/a carer for a partner with BPD. I am at a point where I just don't know what to do anymore. Everything feels too hard I just need to rest for a while. Any advice is much appreciated, Thank you",Alaska_young,Community Member,24-09-2017,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/not-sure-if-i-have-ptsd/td-p/335376
PTSD-1691,Multiple traumas = multiple living challenges,"First time posting finally need to say it outloud to the world. I have so much to say and I'll get to say it to a professional soon I just need to make that phone call to book myself in. I seen my GP after going back to work and a conversation with my eldest son & mum (feeling like I'm too much for them) and my incredible partner who is at his end with me and rightly so. I done some research and stumbled apon info on PTSD. I'm hyper vigilant, easily confused indecisive and my attitude goes up/down, insomnia/lethargy. I've even started to tell the most silly unnecessary lies I do it As I'm feeling stupid or I've done something unsafe or not thinking properly. I can loosely function keep a job, cook meals talk properly occasionally. My back story I come from a verbally home my mum lied slot cause she was frightened and dad was physically abusive at times. I was sexually assaulted at 17. DV relationship for about a year when I was 21-22. Heavy drugs came into picture at 23-24 which caused psychosis and some weird incidents. Another abusive short lived relationship and I lost/gave up care of my eldest child. Went to rehabilitation for 18mths dealt with above issues to a degree. 4 yrs later I got custody back. 26 - 38 I was in a long term relationship we had a child together and she has Autism (high functioning) we were together 13 yrs last 6 yrs he had rare cancer and I nursed him in the last year until he died. I then met my current partner about 7-8mths after last trauma. I feel inlove however always knew that I was ok and really shouldn't be in a relationship until I had some balance and was in a healthy place to be with him. We kinda separated and he came back we feel back into each other and I fell pregnant so we almost at the 2 yr anniversary and he's had enough of my ways. i just don't see things tunnel visioned I struggle to communicate I'm overly passive as I said I'm telling lies cause I don't want to look bad, I'm not thinking about both my children's needs equally it's one or the other. He no longer believes me or feels that I'm safe to be left alone. I have no forward planning for family outings so we just don't do it. I'm just doing things that make life hard create more work for myself and him. i had friends they've dropped off. I just feel good not good. thanks for reading",Novadreamer,Community Member,23-09-2017,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/multiple-traumas-multiple-living-challenges/td-p/331504

I was told I shld contact Beyond Blue for some personal contact/connection as apparently they think I am not doing so well . Bit unsure of what to type as usually the one listening and rarely divulge anything to anyone unless throwing a temper tantrum. I suffer from severe depression, anxiety (ptsd); brain injury, aas (pabs); epilepsy, spinal injuries, insomnia, arthritis and other stuff. Was told to be as upfront as possible so will add that most injuries were inflicted/caused by third parties so have massive trust issues. Prefer the company of animals to humans. Have no memory prior to 2003 (lost 40yrs worth) which is both a curse and a blessing.

PTSD-1693,One angel and struggles with IVF,"I'm only 34 but just over a year ago found out my time was running out to have a family. I've got fertility issues but am yet to meet 'the one' so after talking with an IVF specialist I started on a journey of IVF using donor sperm. I began my first cycle in October last year thinking with my issues it may take a couple of tries. But surprised even the specialist when I fell pregnant! First trimester went by smoothly, not even morning sickness. At 14.4weeks I became sick one day. 2 days later I started getting pains. Rushed to hospital in time for my water to break and 2 hours after that I delivered my little boy in the ER. Left the hospital after 4 hours with nothing, no info no phone numbers nothing. Never even heard from a social worker. I had to call the hospital to ask about my sons body. It was only then did I talk to a social worker to get permission to release the body to funeral home. 2 weeks later I had a mass start to come out and get stuck. Was rushed to hospital, my anxiety was at its peak and nothing was given to me even though I told them I have anxiety. Found out the mass was a very infected placenta stuck in my cervix and I needed emergency surgery. Was also told the infection may have wrecked my uterus. I was a mess. Two traumas in 2 weeks at a hospital that didn't have proper procedures in place. Ended up on a drip after surgery for 2 days in a room with old men even though I'm a private patient. More trauma for me. Didn't sleep. Asked my something for my anxiety was refused. Asked for a social worker none came. I was still grieving for my lost son and then because of the incompetence of the hospital not doing an ultrasound I had a second trauma. Since all this I've had to go back 3 more cycles of IVF, all failed. No idea if the infection has made my fertility worse. I feel like a failure. I lost my son because as it turns out I have a blood clotting condition. So it's my body that killed him. I don't know why I'm saying all this in here. Maybe I just needed to get it all out. I wonder if I'm good enough to be a Mum. I'm failing as a woman. I'm so tired of being strong but I don't want to give up on this.

PTSD-1694,Can't see my son.,"Hi Everyone This is my first time here, Dont know where else to turn. I have just been tossed away by Ex of 5 years, 5 years of bad and sad events. I'm 43, her 46. We rushed in to the relationship, with her falling pregnant after 3 months. the week I found out I was going to be a dad, I also found out she was cheating, the joy was destroyed. I stayed with her, we fought alot, and I was physically assaulted by her (on numerous occasions) I had to give up all of my friends at her demand if i wanted to know my baby. Find out we're having twins. At 34 weeks, one of the twins died in utero. With bub nearing 1yr, we moved in with my dad, her back went out, bed ridden for 4 weeks, I took over all responsibilities. the Ex, once she was up walking, decided to mix alcohol with medication, ended up assaulting my father. all through the relationship I have been criticized and controlled, to this day, I havnt been allowed to take my son to see my side of the family, my mum has never met him. In this time I busted my neck and back, 2 ruptured discs compressed spinal chord, leaving me impotent. 2 weeks ago she told me she cant live with out sex and that I was withholding on purpose, followed by calling me gay and that I want to have sex with men, she threw things at me and smashed glass everywhere, at this point I picked up a dinning chair and hit the kitchen table with it, she told me to leave, and I immediately left. I got arrested and AVO. now I'm not allowed to see or talk to my son. I dont want her back, the thought hasn't even crossed my mind. But my son is my world, he has global development delays and I was there for him every day. I miss him so much, hes just adorable.

PTSD-1695,Ten years of PTSD and more.,"Hello everyone, I've been sitting on this for a while now, debating with myself if I should make a thread on this forum, and I've finally decided that I want to share my story. I know these posts are limited to 2500 characters so I will do my best to keep this simple, yet honest. When I was a teenager I was gang r*ped in my own house by four acquaintances- they were never charged. My family is very unsupportive, and I can't hold a job, or stay in Uni/TAFE. I run away from anything that scares me. I've lost all of my friends, except three. One is my half sister, another lives in America, and the last is my fiancé. I have been fighting depression, suicide, and anxiety since I was twelve and everything else (PTSD, Binge eating Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder) since I was seventeen. I'm terrified of my uncle, and sometimes my mum. They're both abusive in their own way. My dad is the absent father. My two older sisters are terrible secret keepers, and the youngest of the two is admittedly my mums favourite. The eldest no longer talks to me. I feel like a stranger in my own home. Shopping is therapeutic to me which is bad since I am trying to save to move house and fund my own wedding. Most days I find myself...Sitting or laying in bed watching things, or just laying there staring out the window, I reflect on my life and how much I'm a failure. Thing is, I've been fighting for so long that I've forgotten what it's like to be normal. I've seen so many psychologists and counsellors that it's all lost meaning to me. However, I'm still trying, still fighting. I want to start a new chapter, even if it takes another ten years worth of pages and fighting. I don't believe my mind will ever get better, but I want a future where I'm happy and free...and I'm going to keep fighting for it.",Pinkicorn,Blue Voices Member,13-09-2017,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ten-years-of-ptsd-and-more/td-p/308873
PTSD-1696,"Trying to get better, not sure I'm so great at it.","I was diagnosed with PTSD over a decade ago now. It came with a dose of hyper-vigilance (not sure of the spelling). At the time, I was told by the government appointed psychologist that my hypervigilance was probably necessary for my survival, and it could be treated later, but for now I needed it. I did end up needing it. The person involved was later convicted of threat to kill and breach of intervention order (convicted again on appeal to the higher court). My intervention order basically lasts (and was granted before all of this) for until we both die. I just don't know how to get better now. I have spent so long, looking for the danger, I don't know how to turn off, and just look at the pretty ... It was before now, this is just one. Before is probably about the same worse. Blah. how? How do I get better? I actually tried calling today - I got hung up on. And told off, before that. Yay. Apparently, if I mention what I am stressing about, that is confrontational to the person doing their job. And they are allowed to just hang up.

PTSD-1697,I did blame mum. Because she did do the wrong thing,I'm not too sure how to start this but for as long as I can remember 12-16 years maybe.. me and my sister have been the ones to witness my mother and her horrible choice in partners. its been a few years since she was with a very toxic person that ruined everything for my mother but also for me and my sister. After seeing my mum get physically and emotionally abused it sent me into a very lonely and sad place because I have always felt like if I were to tell someone that wouldn't be okay so I have kept it to myself for so many years. I hit breaking point and it all came back and hurt more than ever. Which was hard but I have never been one to make other feel like they are reasonable for my own personal problems. I have always been one to help others which point my own mental health into a serious spiral down hill which has been difficult to deal with but I have done it. i wish my mother didn't keep going back to such a toxic person because me and my sister are now struggling with flashbacks.

PTSD-1698,How to overcome nightmares and flashbacks,After 16 years of one assault and 7 years of another. I have finally opened up about it. It's the worst thing and best thing I've done. Finally getting a weight lifted of my shoulders. The worst is all these emotions I'm dealing with. I'm getting nightmares of one assault and flashbacks of the other. And vice-versa The nightmares are shocking that I've actually been scared of falling asleep because of them. Wanting to fall asleep on making my anxiety worse because I'm scared that they will come back to hurt me. (Which I know won't happen) So my question how do you deal with these.

PTSD-1708,PTSD - ANHEDONIA,"Hi everyone, just wanting to know if any one suffers from these above mentioned? I have a huge childhood trauma history although I have always held a full time job. In the last 18months I took the only job I could at the time working with Teenagers in residential care. I have felt my health declining since January. I have recently been so tired to do anything, I have absolutely no emotion or feelings. It feels like I'm empty inside. I have lost my passion & drive for all I used to love. Every day is the same. My job is a daily cocktail of verbal & physical threats or abuse. There is no support if you get assaulted. Could this daily exposure to abuse trigger something deep within my history of abuse? I feel nothing, no empathy, no sympathy. My sense of humour that was wicked hardly rates its head. I can't play a full song in the car I keep changing it. I'm so tired I have put on 3kgs in the last month alone when I was so active. Just the thought of doing something makes me yawn. I have had depression most of my life but I was able to laugh & enjoy doing things? I don't want live like this forever it's horrible, I feel like I'm wasting every day but there's nothing I can do. I am financially stable & could do or go anywhere in the world but I have absolutely no inkling to do anything.

PTSD-1709,Irritability and Rage,"4 year's ago I was diagnosed with PTSD and had no idea what is was and for 2 and a half year's I didn't deal with it because I didn't know how too. Late last year I had experienced a major anxiety attack due to being stressed and overwhelmed with hypervigilance, I didn't get enough sleep or food simply living off coffee to stay awake which only heightened everything. That I did not want to experience again on that level so I knew that I needed to understand PTSD and change my lifestyle. In March I quit smoking, coffee, sugar and I continue to eat healthy and is exercising more. I go for walk's that clear my mind and I'm also trying mindfulness. Ever since I quit smoking it feel's as if my mind is clearer and I don't experience anxiety often like I used to, my body is not all tensed or sore I can breathe better as it felt like I was holding my breath when the anxiety started up. In July I became extremely irritable over something very small, I knew it at the time but the feeling was getting stronger every minute so I stopped what I was doing got up and went to the toilet took 5 minutes to wet my face and try to cool down to no avail. I was at work and I knew that I needed to leave So I told my boss who had noticed how worked up I was and told me to take the afternoon off. I didn't return to work for 2 week's as the irritability just kept gaining in strength and I felt like a danger to everyone around me and myself as I couldn't contain myself any longer so my inner hulk came out in the worst way and now I was displaying Rage. It's horrible. Most of the time I cannot control it, it must come out. When it doe's come out I can't believe that just came from me. My family have copped it lately I am grateful that they understand that this is something I have no control over but there are way's to minimise my irritability that lead's to rage and that's going for my walk's everyday, getting enough sleep, mindfulness and thinking that not everything does not need me to react to it. I have found that being around negative influence's also trigger my irritability that I do avoid being around it however when I am at ease and clear I do tackle the negative stuff just to build myself up to it making myself stronger mentally.

PTSD-1711,Workplace triggers,"Sorry for how long this Is, just having some workplace issues triggering my PTSD and I was hoping for some advice from those who may relate. I took a call centre job 3 months ago after having a lot of trouble finding work. I was prepared for abuse from people we're calling but hadn't prepared myself for the treatment from the supervisors. We have a very high target rate that I struggle to meet due to my submissive/non-confrontational personality. We get yelled at constantly by our main supervisor, she swears at us and calls us idiots and dumbasses, and hits the back of our chairs to scrare us if we're underperforming.. She has also stated that nothing gives her more joy than writing up breaches, so she's constantly on the lookout for small mistakes we may make. My anxiety is at an all time high, and I'm finding that constant feeling of anticipating that I'm going to get in trouble is triggering terrible feelings from my childhood. I get into a horrible cycle of panicking that I haven't got enough people, then sounded increasingly panicked on the phone and gradually doing worse and worse which makes me more panicked- by the end of the shift i'm a nervous wreck. I've been applying for tons of jobs but have had no luck and I don't want to quit without something else to go to, especially because the job market in my city is terrible at the moment. On the other hand I also don't want to have a nervous breakdown or emotional flashback and i'm concerned I definitely will.

PTSD-1713,"Abuse, physical reaction to ""triggers""","Hi. This is my first post here, so bear with me if it´s a bit all over the place. The reason I am writing this post, is because I have lately had a few incidents that is really starting to effect my every day life. So, a very long story short; many years back I got involved with a guy that wasn´t very nice to say the least. I had some really horrible incidents with him being violent, and a lot of verbal and sexual abuse. This happened in periods of months usually on and off from I was 16 to 20, yet we were never actually in a relationship. Needless to say, this has caused me a lot of emotional stress that keeps with me to this day, 3 years later. I have recently moved in with two friends, which is fun and all, but there is a lot of banter, usually commenting looks, weight etc. What is really stressful to me, is that when this happens, I physically react to it. These were things my ex-whatever-he-was would comment on, and it could easily escalate in to sexual abuse. When I now get comments like this, I often feel dizzy, sometimes to the point where I have trouble seeing, I get urges to throw up (I have been struggling with bulimia) I get instant headaches, my mouth dries up, and my whole body tenses. I was wondering if any of you have any tips to what I can do to not react so strongly to these things? I just don´t want to be this party pooper that can´t handle a little bit of banter.",smo,Community Member,04-08-2017,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/abuse-physical-reaction-to-quot-triggers-quot/td-p/337337

PTSD-1715,Before it gets worse,"hi there I am feeling really low right now and I feel like I just can't go on being a Mum. I can't handle it when my children cry. Like, I seriously can't handle it. They are 18mo and 3. This morning I pushed my 18mo away and he bumped his head on the table. I don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know what to do. I hate the kind of mother I am and I really wanted to give them more than this. I can't be in the present moment, and when my kids force me to be in it, I flip out. To a bystander I might seem normal but inside I am like a bomb waiting to go off. I would never hurt my kids but I can understand why and how people do it. and that scares me, to know that. Am i capable of it? yes. Do i love my kids? more than anything. But i can't cope. How can i explain this to my partner and his family (our support). I want to be alone. i want them to be in daycare everyday. I want someone to be here at home with us to help us, to help me. I want to throw myself into full time work so that I don't have to be their mum, but that's not going to solve anything, is it. I'm going to give the blueknot foundation a call today.

PTSD-1717,"One day I'm feeling on top of the world, then boom I'm a mess!","This is my first post on here, feeling a bit weird about posting but what can I loose. I have depression and PTSD for most of my adult life. I have been married for 26 yrs to a great man. I have 3 lovely daughters who are all special in their own way. I should be oh so happy right...well not today. In the last 10yrs I have been mostly feeling great. I finally started to see the world around me and enjoy the simplest of things, like my beautiful surroundings and how lucky I am to have 3 amazing girls. So why today do I feel lousy? Inside I just want to cry and feel sorry for myself. I feel lonely and sad. This happens to me every couple of months and I hate it. I usually manage to pull myself out of it but today it is tough. It only took a couple of days of having bad headaches, which turned into a migraine yesterday. I end up feeling a bit neglected and unloved when I'm not well. My husband doesn't give me the attention that I am wanting. It sounds really selfish but leaving me for hours in pain and finally saying ""do you want some water?"" I had to ask him to go to the chemist for something stronger than Panadol. Then my daughter comes home from school and I was thinking he would have said Mums not well. She went on the computer and never came near me. So then I start to get upset. Saying things to myself like...""no one gives a shit about me"". Then I crack it with a splitting head ache to Hubby.

PTSD-1718,What to do with anger?,"Hi, i’m new to these forums. I encountered a traumatic event 2 years ago. I’m now 6 months into the healing process and have recently started therapy with a trauma psychologist. But I’m struggling. I’m angry, impatient, restless and on-edge all the time. The smallest things trigger intense rage - and I don’t know what to do with it. So I turn it inwards. The other day driving the car, I ended up pinching my legs so hard that I was screaming in pain (it was to prevent myself from a road rage incident). Most days I binge eat to swallow anger. Or i throw something to smash. And the rest of the time it turns into frustrated helplessness. I'm already doing light exercise at gym most days (weights, walking or pool), which is probably helping a little... but its not enough. I’ve read that anger is part of the healing process when coming out of (or through) trauma - but I’m yet to learn a productive way to channel it outwards (rather than inwards). I’m a bit of a passivist, but I've been thinking about taking up boxing - to punch bags, not people. Has anyone found that helpful? Or some kind of martial arts? has anyone here experienced other ways of physically channeling this angry energy outwardly and productively? At this stage, I'm open to all ideas about what to do with anger cheers",PeacefulWarrior,Community Member,07-08-2017,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/what-to-do-with-anger/td-p/276142

PTSD-1726,"After 3 and a half decades, it seems to matter now!","Hello, first time poster! 40 year old male here. I'll try and keep it concise. When I was at pre-school, aged about 4 years old, something happened to me, that 30 years later, became apparently more abusive, than just something that just happened to ""all kids"". It wasn't a memory that overwhelmed me, or even plagued me for many years, it was just ""one of those things"", until about 7 years ago, I randomly shared the experience with friends, to somewhat shocked responses. I instantly played it down as a ""mis-memory"" so to speak but the memory has no begun to really bother me, 3 and a half decades later. I have a memory of being taken into a room at pre-school, being made to get naked and then ""examined"". I remember it as being under the pretense of a medical examination, by a visiting nurse but have no idea consciously, who it was. So for me, this became what happened to every kid, when the nurse came to visit for health check-ups. Many years Iater I shared this with my friends and NOBODY else had this experience. Some were a bit more like WTF? Does anyone else in or from Tasmania, know if this actually was ""standard procedure"" in the early 1980's? Because part of me is hanging onto the thread that it was just a ""medical check-up"" but the fact that it's always been a moment in my life that made me feel uncomfortable enough to never forget it and the lack of other peers having the same experience, is making me think the worst and question the whole issue!

PTSD-1727,Desperately needing a safe place conflict free,"I have been struggling for the last two weeks. There is a work situation where my boss is under investigation for abusive behaviour to both children & staff. There has been so much conflict around me & im not allowed to talk about it with anyone, which has triggered the PTSD & anxiety in me. It has left me feeling unsafe triggering memories of my last boss who was violent & abusive to me. And also childhood memories of never feeling safe. Right now, i am so desperate for a safe place, somewhere I can hide & find a safe place of comfort. i have also been noticing that since having PTSD, the city life doesn't seem to suit me. I am longing for a less fast paced, noisy, superficial world. I'm longing for peace, calmness, getting back to the basics & closer to nature. Somewhere tranquil.

PTSD-1733,Coming to terms with my life,"Recently, I had my 54th birthday. I realise that I have reached middle age. It is a far cry from where I had hoped to be by now. It got me thinking, what went wrong with my life? Where do I begin? My sense of self and my ability to concentrate were damaged through child abuse in my youth. I was only an average student at school. My parenting and my education did not prepare me for what I would encounter in the world. I was naive about people and the effects the system can have on you. But I took responsibility for myself and started to work on my mind and my future. After a low level career as a public servant I realised that I wanted to become a psychologist so I enrolled in a course at uni. It proved to be my undoing. While studying I fell victim to intense and intrusive harassment. I was assaulted psychologically. The effects were disastrous. I was unable to continue my studies and was forced from my home. The perpetrators of my demise are still a part of my life. They are authority figures who intimidate me into believing that there is something inherently wrong with me. They imply that they are not trying to harm me, but their treatment has caused me nothing but harm. Every facet of my life has been adversely affected by them. I am now a disabled pensioner without a soul in the world. As I see it, the situation is helpless. They are my enemy, not my ally. I don't want their treatment. I don't want to be their guinea pig. I feel helpless, powerless, and worthless. I do not have what it takes to do battle with them. Meanwhile I continue to suffer while doing what I can to help myself cope. Many of us are victims of a vastly inadequate system. We never reach our potential or have a life that is worthwhile. I will continue to be desperate and lonely. Praying for mercy. For an end to the suffering before my old age. Mine has been a wasted life. Serving no purpose. A loser in a game I cannot win. The perpetrators delude themselves that they are right. I know who is inherently wrong. The truth will die with me one day in the not so distant future. My life has been an injustice, from beginning to end.

PTSD-1734,"Family hurts, but I want it so bad","Hi everyone, I am having a bit of a rough time. I've come to realise that I have C-PTSD and I am learning about how this has happened, and why. My attachment with my Mum was screwed. She no doubt had CPTSD when I was growing up due to my dad being violent, and then his suicide when I was 8. We still do not have a good relationship and it hurts. I know she wants it, and I want it, but we are both too damaged to let each other into our hearts. One of my brothers died by suicide many years ago, and my remaining brother and I are/were/try to be very close. To cut a long story short, my Mum and brother are triggers for me and I do not enjoy their company. I really really want to, and I love them very much but I am on edge and scared and I can see their pain behind their masks and it cuts me so deep. We are planning on catching up for Xmas and a significant birthday and as much as I want to see them, I don't want to. I feel so sad because I live close to my partners family and they are a close and lovely family but I just feel like such an outsider. I so deeply want a connection with my family and yet I can't see it happening. I am opening up the past because it is controlling me and I need to deal with what happened throughout my childhood (The brother who died was violent and we lived in constant fear). I fear that my Mum and brother will not be supportive or ready to face what has happened and so I feel like I am on my own with this. I am a mother of 2 now, and my C-PTS is going to be passed onto my children, so I need and want to heal and recover. I know it is possible but I feel so alone. And sad. I don't know which treatment will be best for me. I am interested in body based stuff, and art but I feel like I am facing a big mountain trek and I am scared.

PTSD-1736,My blood family is my least support,Hey guys. I have been feeling the anxiety really hit me hard lately and I was directed here. Here is my story. Since October I have had so much lOSS it is now finally hitting home. First my father in law pasked away from natural causes and not long after my mother's partner I have known for twenty years. I separated with my partner of 10 years. Although we still get along well it was a big change. On new years day my 6 year old son accidentally lit a fire in my car (no one was harmed) so I was down to public transport for 5 months. Then the worst of all happened when my 9 1/2 months old son passed away after drowning in a bath tub at my ex partners boyfriends house on the 03/03/2017. The time was 4.50 pm. Ten minutes before he was meant to be coming to my house for the weekend again. As you could understand I was distraught. I had very good help from my co-workers and friends. Even my ex partners family were very supportive towards me. What really killed me even more was when the funeral was meant to happen I was told that my sister may not make it because of a holliday she was booked to go on and my own father might not because he had to work. The date was changed and they did make it but neither wanted to see his body. Which meant in his short life my father never saw his grandson even once. Now I need help most of all but the only time I hear from my family is because of something I have done wrong yet again. Even though I do not touch drugs. Always at work without fail. And I love my other kids dearly. Sorry about the blabbering btw. Just wanted to get ithe off my chest. In no way do I want to harm myself or anyone else but I do know I need help,Odie1981,Community Member,29-06-2017,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-blood-family-is-my-least-support/td-p/349739

I don't know what to do anymore my boys are abusive to me I have done so many parenting courses and asked for help but nothing has worked. I'm finding my self so angry with everyone and everything ATM as my kids have mentally drained me. I just wish I could pack up my kids and leave all the stress behind and start a new life away from the town that my abusers and ex lives as I know it would help.",mof4,Community Member,21-06-2017,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/newbie-full-time-single-mum/td-p/329404
PTSD-1739,My brother is in an abusive relationship,"Hi everyone. My brother is in an abusive relationship. His wife hits him and she locks herself in a room for hours refusing to do anything. Last week she threw herself out of a moving car during an argument regarding how she doesn't think she is good enough for him. He is trying to handle it privately but it is getting worse because he blames himself for it even though he is utterly doting; he has had to leave work early on numerous occasions to go to her when she ""loses it"" and I don't think him doing this is actually helping the situation. It stems from insecurities but I think she is suffering from a disorder although she has not been diagnosed. She tells him that if he talks to me (his sister- we are very close just 18 months apart) and his Mother, that he is betraying her and shaming her so he won't contact me or my mum. He rang me secretly to ask me not to message him because she checks his messages. It is so dangerous, I want to help but I don't want to make it worse. Any advice on how to handle the situation? My mum and I have tried messaging him about mundane things like the new plant in the garden but he won't reply for ages and then panic reply while she is out. He believes he is protecting her by not talking to us but this is so unhealthy. We are trying to get him to persuade her to go to a psychiatrist but don't know how to go about it. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.",Concerned_Sister,Community Member,29-06-2017,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-brother-is-in-an-abusive-relationship/td-p/349743
PTSD-1740,"Grief, not nice","Hi there, hello......yeah I'm new. I'm okay just lonely and sad, I don't really have any words, just man tears and a wounded soul. My wife died of cancer 5 weeks ago, we have two teenage daughters, 18 and 14. I use to think grief was something one passed through, but I now realise it's part of the new you, it's there forever whether invited or not. I also use to be a pretty normal, happy guy, I just turned 50 on the weekend and have a great bunch of friends. We had the perfect family and the 4 of us did everything together. My friends in the main leave me alone, because I apparently need time and space, but while everyone gets back to normal, I'm still here redefining reality. I get it, this is my bag, nobody elses.

PTSD-1741,Still hope for Change,"Hi First Post im nearly 50 and things have to change perhaps Im addressing my elephant in the room Ive known for many years that through a number of different events in my life, being early childhood trauma and adult trauma experience that my keel has not been, shall we say “even”. Ive struggled with addiction, self doubt and self loathing and in more recent years self harm. I have bad memories, no memories and struggle to imagine a where I will smile more than frown I have examined and processed a lot, and actually let go of a lot of thoughts, ideas and memories that were just not useful. Changed behaviour and attitudes where I could. However in the last few years Ive become more aware of triggers and protection mechanisms that are still with me they make me unhappy and I see myself going in circles and its getting worse there is still a little boy who learnt along time ago how to keep himself safe, the problem is what used to work when I was 3 and 9 and 13 no longer works. It no longer works that my default is to mistrust me and other people. It no longer works to be in a perpetual state of fear,anxiety and angst. Recently things derailed again, once again I seek help, but maybe, just maybe ill be ok and ill be able to break down that wall once and for all.",citizen,Community Member,27-05-2017,PTSD and trauma,25,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/still-hope-for-change/td-p/350066
PTSD-1742,Finding it tough after ending a difficult/emotionally abusive relationship,"Hi there, I'm hoping that someone out there might have some pearls of wisdom for me. I recently ended (about 6 weeks ago) a 3 year relationship that proved very bad for me. My (now ex) partner, who I loved very much and thought would be my partner for life, had always been somewhat aloof. He also travelled a lot for work, and the combination of these things became over the last year or so impossible and extremely depressing. For whatever reason, he started making fun of me in front of people, treating me as if I was stupid, never saying anything nice or seeming proud of me for anything that I had done - just constantly withholding affection and interest in my life, which became very demoralizing and I had started seeking treatment for depression. I am intelligent, kind, attractive, and have lots of friends so realise that, objectively, these things are untrue. However, I really feel like he has chipped away at my confidence to the point where it's so hard to remember how to pull myself back together in any kind of useful way. I am also now fairly sure that he is seeing someone else, a girl I knew he always seemed in contact with at the end. This feels quite devastating, even though when I ended it didn't resist in any way so I assumed he was probably interested in someone else. I know it is all for the best, but I really am struggling with how to move on with my life. I am also 31, so surrounded by people getting married and having babies, which is not a great help at this point!

She has said the triggers since i met her . I would ask if she could not say or talk like that as it just hurts..and now i just can't take it anymore, i just can't seem to cope with it. They are setting my triggers and anxiety off.. I'm feeling the previous pain from as a child , now when she says those things. I see the events from those words she says.

PTSD-1744,Wanting to talk to my abuser,"Something happened to me 10 years ago which I have been carrying around because I didn't know what to make of it. During a random episode that I get every now and then I felt finally ready to tell my husband who I have been with for 9 years exactly what happened. I felt a bit of relief to get it off my chest but still having a hard time. 10 years ago I was in a relationship with a guy who was very controlling, jealous and suicidal. He was very mentally abusive and manipulative. I remember clearly the huge screaming fights he would have with me in front of everyone, cornering me at my locker, following me to an empty classroom locking the door and getting all in my face, forcing me to say I love him, threatening to kill himself and blaming me if I was to breakup with him. I could go on but it was so full on. After 6 months of attempting to leave him we went through a stage of him accepting we were going to be over and doing everything 'one last time'. I remember being at his house trying to break up with him and he wanted to do things with me one last time. I said no at first but he begged and begged. I didn't want to but then he promised if I let him he would leave me alone. Thinking back at it now I think how stupid I was to believe something like that. But at the time I felt like that was my only option to finally get him to leave me alone. I wanted to believe him so much. So I let him. He didn't keep his word. Instead he went and told all his friends all the details and how 'I enjoyed it' which made me feel so ashamed of myself to actually let this happen. To be so foolish to believe him. I guess I was desperate to believe anything to have him leave me alone. Flash forward 10 years and still get jumpy with the sound of his name, being in a crowd or anyone that comes around the corner that catches me with surprise. I get panic attacks, I get a lot of anxiety and with any confrontation I can't handle it. I feel like I should be over it by now. I don't even know if what happened was considered sexual assault because I let him. I don't know what to make out of it. I sometimes feel like I want to confront him. I want to know if he knew what he did was wrong and if he regrets it. I know it won't change anything but I think a lot about the conversation. It's very unlikely that would happen. I guess it makes my angry that's his happy and I'm still effected by this 10 years later.

PTSD-1745,Is it normal to feel so flat all the time ?,"Hi all, I’m a 46 year old woman and quite attractive, but I really struggle with low self esteem, feelings of boredom/emptiness - lack of enthusiasm for anything, fatigue, & general apathy towards whatever I am doing. Although my life is pretty good, compared to a lot of others: I have a partner of 15 yrs, a 27yr old daughter and 3 x adult stepchildren & my 15 month old grandson. We own our own beautiful home. I work my own hours within my partners business. We all have good health. I don't have any hobbies or interests. I have tried to get into all sorts of things but the enthusiasm isn't there. I've tried gyms, yoga, meditation, etc. All these things were ok when I started but never lasted more than a few weeks before I stopped doing them because I just couldn't be bothered. I have rarely ever finished anything in life that I have started. I can't focus on tasks at work most times. No matter how much I have to do I always find myself mentally wandering off. I was diagnosed with depression a few yrs ago, and went on anti depressants for a month or so. I stopped taking them as I didn’t feel any different on them and I hated the stigma attached to taking them. I was sexually abused by my own grandfather from the age of 4 yrs until the age of 8. This abuse was not constant, it was on and off over these years. I remember all of it. My family were unaware of this so there was nobody to protect me back then. I have been to therapists over the years to try and deal with it, but all they do is ask how I felt and I have to repeat the story over. I guess I feel hurt that when I told my parents on my 18th birthday about the abuse, they didn’t approach him about it as he was very high up in the Police Force and it was all too hard? I don’t know. So I end up feeling lost in my own life. I don't know what I want to do, I do know that I want to stop putting myself down and thinking that everyone else is above me. I want a passion, an interest, but there is nothing there. Is it depression? Laziness? I don't know. But it's there. All the time. A big emptiness that surrounds me, and I can't see the way out. I know I am not alone in feeling this way. I have read many people’s experiences online and I can identify with them a lot. So I guess I want to put my feelings out there somewhere. Maybe to help someone else feel that they are not “alone” in feeling this way, but maybe, so that I will have some kind of “belonging” by sharing this with people. x",nic29,Community Member,20-06-2017,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/is-it-normal-to-feel-so-flat-all-the-time/td-p/325795
PTSD-1746,Feel like I'm not alowed to say I have PTSD.,"A few years ago I had a real crappy experience that triggered night terrors and the feeling of never being safe, having to be on guard all the time. My boyfriends father attempted to strangle me. He never got to lay a finger on me but was real close and the intention was really obvious. My therapist told me I was having symptoms of PTSD but not just from that event but from everything else in my life leading to it and that scare triggered it. Im the youngest of five, my mother is mentally unwell, my home wasn't a happy place and not a place I ever felt I could be myself. Always stressful. I have very difficult relationships with all my siblings. I feel that none of us learnt how to deal with our pain so would take it out on the next person and then that person would take it out on the next and so on. And you see I'm at endof this screwed up waterfall but I didn't have anyone to take it out on but myself. I was diagonosed with anxiety in kindergarten I think and probably was depressed since then too. After this incident with my boyfriends dad I was heartbroken and shocked to have 2 family members feel the need to repetivly and kinda aggressively remind me that he didn't touch me. In a way to tell me I have no reason to still be upset or struggling with it. Something I have put together recently is this shame of being the victim that my eldest sister passed onto me. Both of my sisters were sexually abused by my eldest brother, I have no memories of it happening to me but I can't rule out the possibility (use to change my nappies and babysit) but I'm not aloud to talk about it. So because of my sisters trauma she has put me down whenever I've shown any sign of feeling sorry for myself. I have many experiences with family members that still effect me to this day. They are manipulative, hypercritical and narcissistic. my mind does this thing where it just thinks of horrible things happening and then another and another n it snowballs n I feel stressed n scared. I have a lot of self doubt and find myself shouting in empty rooms cause I'm so angry. It makes sense to me that I have PTSD but my therapist had a baby n I have moved so I haven't had the chance to really talk about it to anyone. Im sick of feeling ashamed to think I might have PTSD, because I never been physically abused so therefore I'm not alowed to say I'm struggling.",Amella,Community Member,22-06-2017,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/feel-like-i-m-not-alowed-to-say-i-have-ptsd/td-p/329487
PTSD-1747,Sibling Abuse,"I'm gonna try make this quick before I recede back into myself. I think, like most all people here, I have a history of mental health problems. Namely I go through bouts of depression & anxiety- sometimes it isn't so bad, other times its terrible. I'm in that terrible place right now. Now I like actively seeking to understand and resolve myself. I fought my problems whilst I was school fairly actively: I joined the public speaking team, I saw counsellors, I made a concerned effort to connect with people & maintain friendships and I opened my feelings to them. It worked pretty well. But now I'm out of school and working a lot of those safeguards have been removed, and although it could be worse, I'm still struggling. And I think I've found the prime mover for a lot of my problems. My older brother is 4 years older than me and from the ages of 12-16 I was victim of what I think is abuse. Despite being mildly bullied at school, home wasn't a particularly pleasant place for me. My brother and I were always fighting and I feel his actions were unjustified. I have blurry memories of instances of physical and emotional abuse. I remember him tackling me through dry wall once. I remember him hurting me with a pencil. I remember him throwing a salt shaker that narrowly missed me. I remember regular physical fights that left me in tears and my ears ringing, and when I hid in my room he'd sing and laugh at me, taunting me and, afterwards, he'd nonchalantly watch TV, and I'd be stuck in my room for hours because I didn't want the confrontation. To be fair he gave a lot of my family a tough time (even now we physically fight- yes he lives with us still). We couldn't sit near each other at the dinner table. He lived with my grandparents at one point. I used to have dreams of me fighting him, but every time he felt nothing, like my hands were made of nothing. There's so much else that I can remember, and so much else I feel I've forgotten. I've traced a lot of my current-day issues to him, and now there's nothing more I want to do than to hurt him the way he's hurt me, but even so the idea makes me want to cry, and I tremor and get scared. Any form of confrontation with him amplifies these reactions. My depression and anxiety is getting worse, and I know how bad it can get. Is it safe to assume that my childhood experiences with my brother are the reason, or at least, a partial reason for this? What should I do?",Egbert97,Community Member,16-06-2017,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sibling-abuse/td-p/317351
PTSD-1748,A grief I can't shift,"As a child I was raised by my maternal grandparents and lost my grandfather to Alzheimer's Disease at age 15. I was completely destroyed as both he and my grandmother were my world. My grandfather was a very kind man with not a bad bone in his body. He was quiet, but at the same time he was very merry, loved to joke, sing Italian opera and loved kids. I couldn't have asked for better grandparents and life was basically perfect, minus the fact I was teased a lot at school for having Italian grandparents who couldn't speak English. They grew all their own food, spent their days making pasta and pasta sauce en-masse. I kind of grew up like someone would have in the early 20th century - at night we would eat cheese after dinner, go for our evening passeggiata and then play cards. The days I would spend in the orchard playing with the chickens or following my grandfather around the garage, or learn to sew. I learnt to read and write in Italian before I went to school, and during school I practised Italian literacy and history for an hour each day. I never really did fit in with many people because my upbringing was so starkly different to every other child in the 1990s. I still feel dreadful from my grandfather's death and a big part of me mourns a way of living that no longer exists in our modern. For the most part, I feel like no one really gets me, except for people about 50 years older than me with whom I seem to get along quite well. Fast forward to the last few years and in the space of one year both my dogs died after being poisoned by a next door neighbour, then my grandmother who raised me died quite suddenly. Now only several months my other grandmother with whom I am quite close now has cancer. Death is inevitable, and I know this, but with all those closest to me dying - particularly now in the past year - I don't really know how to cope. I feel like I have nothing good left in my life or no one to really live for.

I pointed out that this could trigger outbursts if he couldn't find his camping equipment.

PTSD-1750,Long hard fight,"Hello all finding it hard to cope. My first experience with ptsd was when I was 7 years old. It was my first time fishing on a beach. I heard a scream, and turned around to see a man fall from a cliff. I was not far way and it still haunts me. It was sureel I can remember running around screaming for help. I felt so help less. Once the ambos got there and carefully got him on to trolley and in ambo he was dead in a few minutes. I was left with nightmares for several years, and started bed wetting which lasted years. Since that day I am scared of heights. My second ptsd experience was on 8/03/98 was a car accident into a tree, l got knocked out and woke up inside my car which was well alight, and full of smoke. The doors would not open, it got scary. Had to wind down window to get out. One night in hospital, and 3 days off work. Did 2 days of work and it was the weekend, felt lucky to be alive, the ptsd did not hit me yet. But that Saturday 14/03/98 I was in the city crossing flinders st and got hit by a police car speeding with no lights or sirens on. Did not get knocked out, remember it like yesterday. Almost lost my leg. 4 months in wheel chair 8 months off work. I was 20 years old in my prime, long hard road to recovery. I have been battling the black dog on and off since then, used alcohol and drugs for many years to self medicate. Have had on going back problems since then. For the last 19 years life has been a real struggle. I worry to much and all the other problems that come with ptsd. Lost most of my friends and have not had a girl friend since then. My life is a mess can't seem to get my shit together. With every passing year l look back and wish it was my last year alive. I am a broken man with no hope, goals or dreams.

PTSD-1752,"Underestimating my PTSD (Trigger warning, descriptions of violence)","Is it okay to describe my traumatic event here? Please don't read on if it will make you anxious - I gave some advice on an anxiety thread that I realized I haven't always been following myself with my PTSD - that is, because I don't see my traumatic event as being as ""serious"" or ""as bad"" as many other people's (which it isn't) - I think I ""shouldn't"" be suffering PTSD for it - I should just ""get over it"". Also because my anxiety has been quite extreme and much more of a handicap in my life, I've put up with the milder PTSD problems while I try to deal with the anxiety. In my case my dad was very angry and violent and hit us kids quite a lot (out of anger rather than discipline) but for whatever reason, the event that I suffer PTSD over was of witnessing him beating the animals on our farm - though we were terrified of him personally - it was seeing him hitting the animals with sticks, rakes, shovels etc. that has affected my sister and I all our lives. We could always hear the animals screaming out (indeed neighbouring farms rang the RSPCA a number of times) but we always avoided going out to see what was happening. When I was around 7 years old, my older sister encouraged/made me go out to see what was going on and he was hitting one of the animals in the milking pen as hard as he possibly could with a garden stake - the sight of it trying to escape with it's head stuck in the stock of the milking pen and the uncontrolled rage that my dad had has stuck with me for more than 30 years. (I saw him beat them many more times but that first occasion just got stuck in my head) It would happen at night in the dark and the milking shed would be all lit up so it was the only thing you could see (I can STILL see it!) I very often had nightmares, flashbacks, sometimes vomiting when I thought of it and it fed into my anxiety in a big way - I was always anxious that I would accidentally anger someone (forget their name, bump my shopping trolley into them, refuse to donate to their charity...!) but the picture of what anger LOOKED like was that image of my dad. Besides the relief of talking about it, my point is that it doesn't matter if it was a big or small thing that traumatized us - the affect on our lives can be just as devastating - I wish I had taken it much more seriously, much earlier on... thanks for letting me share, J.",Mr_Walker,Community Member,01-06-2017,PTSD and trauma,17,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/underestimating-my-ptsd-trigger-warning-descriptions-of-violence/td-p/277646

I was in my final year at school when I got involved with an older guy who had Asperger's Syndrome. Like all relationships its started out great - he was my first (well lots of things). He lived with his elder family members to help them with physical stuff as they aged. A couple of years after school, things changed, (from what I have researched ASD becomes harder to manage in men in their 20-30s) and this was proven true.. He went 'missing' on several occasions, to the point at times I had to supply pictures for a 'missing person' poster, he would return after I had spent countless hours scared and crying and not see that anything 'bad' had happened. After this, his family found it best (for themselves) that he now survived on his own - which only meant he then relied on my family support. (All the love to my family - but no one in my small town understood Aspergers, or that it meant he was unable to manage a normal life) this meant I was all alone to deal with everything as it got worse. I loved him but I shortly fell into that big of a whole I resented him, his family his stupid illness. He became controlling (although I still don't know if I can blame him or the ASD), I had to dry dishes in a certain way, cook dinner at the right time, get his clothes so he could go to work. But I couldn't just walk out he would have no one - he cant survive life on his own. Fast forward.. 2 years of the most unhappiest strict relationship. I. HAD. TO. LEAVE. I left, he threated suicide in a public manner to our entire town, on several occasions - they blamed me ( I BLAMED ME!!) He got help, everyone sympathised with him (I Sympathised with him) Until he started to control my life I was livng with out him. He moved back to his family. Life was good (UNTIL), I found a new relationship (bless him he makes me happier than ever) and it started again, I would get cartoon pictures of suicide sent to me all hours of the night, phone called constant 24/7. I involved the police. He got a new girlfriend, They came to town. It started again and then... It was over.

PTSD-1755,PTSD from Emotional Abuse?,"Hi everyone, A couple of questions: I was wondering whether anyone had any information on what exactly constitutes emotional abuse? Is it possible to develop PTSD years after the abuse happened? Can a clinical psychologist diagnose PTSD, or can only a GP/Psychiatrist do that? I'm having a lot of trouble sorting through my past and memories. I thought I just had depression, but my psychologist thinks I have PTSD. I've never experienced any sexual or physical abuse. However I'm starting to remember a volatile emotional environment at home when I was a teenager and young adult which is starting to really bother me. I'm finding it hard to sleep or work - I feel jittery and exhausted, and I have moments of intense emotion or panic, and sometimes I feel like I am not really inside my body. I have stressful memories playing on repeat inside my head all day. I don't get any nightmares or hallucinations though and I feel like therapy might have actually brought this on - I was just feeling regular depressed before therapy - but now I'm experiencing all these other symptoms. So I'm not sure it's PTSD or just therapy making me remember things that make me feel bad. It's pretty confusing because I also remember plenty of warm, happy family times, and currently have a good relationship with my parents. So I swing between intense anger at them, and extreme guilt and anger towards myself for even having bad thoughts about them. It's exhausting!

PTSD-1756,Longing for May To Over Already,"I'm struggling with the month of May. May is full of painful memories & reminders of loss & grief. Mothers day the reminder that I will never be a mum- all I have ever wanted since I was 5 years old was to grow up & be a good mum! The anniversary of my dad's death & loss of losing a close friend, actually the love of my life, on the same day, different years. And my sisters harsh reaction towards me having PTSD- that it's just a label I'm using to stay a victim. Her harsh judgement has made me feel so alone & like I can't honestly say how I'm feeling. I have to pretend I'm ok when I'm not, when I desperately just a hug & support coz I too am only human! I go through this every May. I got through it for the last 21years so I guess I will get through this May too.

PTSD-1757,PTSD resulting from school experiences?,"Hi everyone, I joined the BeyondBlue discussion board about 8 months ago. I haven't used this board a lot but I hope to come here more frequently now as I believe I've found a place in my own home country to come to and share my issues and advice. So I am a 29 year old white female living in Melbourne. I used to live in South Australia as a teen and graduated high school at the age of 17. Now we all know bullying is a common issue in school and a lot of people has gone through this. But for me, I had never really forgotten those bullying I experienced. I was very young when I first experienced bullying. It was at my first primary school, I must have been about 6 or 7. I remember being picked on by these group of boys because I was hanging out with another boy that I liked. As I got older, the bullying from different people in different schools continued (I moved school a lot of times in my childhood). At every school, there was always trouble - from both boys and girls. Sometimes it got physical - I remember a girl hit me hard in the face for not going down a playground pole. It literally felt like a brick and I thought I was disfigured for life (which I wasn't). I've also had people throw stuff at me - insects (living, I hope), sticks and wasted food were the most common objects thrown at me. Then the really bad happened when I was 10 and sexually abused by another girl who was bullying me and directly telling me to move schools because they didn't like me. High school started off pretty bad too. I started putting on a lot of weight due to stress at home and having no virtual support. The teen students would taunt me over my weight, call me rude names, ""really fat and really chubby"" and ""fatty"". A gym teacher even called me a ""fat"" for not being dressed in time for a gym class. I remember a boy called me ""stupid"" for packing my bag in the middle of a hallway where he and his friends were walking through. I remember the boys laughed as they walked passed. I haven't experienced any serious bullying since 2005 (senior year) but the memories still haunt me and upset me. I only wish I had the courage to report those people at the very least and make them realise their actions were not cool. So sometimes I get panic attacks or anxiety and my mind would switch to those bullying memories. It's a vicious circle. I think I'm pathetic for even thinking about school now.",ScarlettR,Community Member,23-05-2017,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-resulting-from-school-experiences/td-p/329788
PTSD-1758,Three years and nine months,"Hello. I've never posted on anything like this before, and while part of me thinks that this might help, another part remains a little unconvinced, so sorry in advance if I don't take a huge part in other threads, or conversations. I've had PTSD for roughly around 3 years now, and haven't always known that I've had it. I was diagnosed with other things like borderline personality disorder, anxiety, depression etc. My PTSD has been triggered by a pregnancy termination that ultimately derailed my life, and was in part, caused by my ex boy friends insistance and pressure to do it. I regret what I did, and I broke my own heart by doing it. I find that I still have nightmares all the time. Sometimes I don't even realise that they're nightmares, but they involve the people who cause distress, and conflicting feelings of love, hatred and desire. When I wake up the next day, I feel like there's an elephant sitting on my chest, and my throat feels constricted and tight. I'm easily irritable and easy to anger. I've made a lot of progress over the past three years, but have recently stopped going to my psychiatrist due to money complications. I had nightmares last night. I suppose I'm writing all of this to just see that there are others in my position, and that there is an end in sight. I find that its hard on my family, and sometimes they don't fully comprehend what's going on. I don't even really know who I am anymore. I kind of feel like the lyrics from The Beatles I'm Looking Through You are a good representation of how I feel about myself ""I'm looking through you, Where did you go? I thought I knew you, What did I know? You don't look different, but you have changed. I'm looking through you, you're not the same.""",StephSaid,Community Member,03-06-2017,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/three-years-and-nine-months/td-p/281823

PTSD-1760,"(Trigger warning) Bullying, home invasion, PCOS and anxiety","Hello, I am new here and not sure how to even go about this. Lets just start at the beginning (well, the beginning of all this). when I was younger I had witnessed numerous things growing up, due to being a victim of circumstance. I was bullied since I first started school, which led to me refusing to be enthusiastic about learning and resulted in me dropping out by yr 10. During my school life, I had witnessed my mother fight for her life with meningitis when I was barely 7 or 8, around the same years my family had a home invasion where my step-father was beaten nearly to death I made eye contact with the men who did it. It was awful. not long after that, my home, just a month or two after my birthday, had had a Molotov Cocktail thrown at it, which resulted in losing our home and being very close to dying. not even a year had gone by when I returned to school for yr 7, that a boy had told me to my face that i should have died there. I lost everything and those words just killed what little of my happiness that i had left. all this happened to me before I had even started year 8, and boy was I not prepared for what was to come during my highschool years. bullying was worse, I was the target of spit balls, aggressive girls looking for fights, and casted aside socially by everyone. I spent 70% of year 9 and 8, hiding in my room, crying myself to sleep. I drew the line when my mum brought home beyond blue books for my ""depression"". I guess I was embarrassed about how horrible my self-esteem was at that age and it definitely didnt help when one of my friends tried to make it a competition of how depressed we could be. it was awful. On my 19th birthday, i had gone into the doctors to pick up my results from some tests I did due to not having my period for a long time.and well, I was diagnosed with PCOS. Too much to go into about what PCOS is, so if you're curious, please just google as I have explained so much its starting to hurt me more. The doctor gave me a prescription, and I took the medication for a while, but it just made me feel sick. Now, today, I'm 20, turning 21 in a few months time. Ive taken tests on beyond blue that suggest my anxiety and depression level is at extreme 'high'. Im constantly crying these passed couple of weeks, ive had mood swings a lot... and not only that, I've been having bursts of anger resulting in me punching walls and going absolutely insane. i can't handle this anymore. Theres so much more to this. Idk what to do.",Spiro96,Community Member,30-05-2017,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trigger-warning-bullying-home-invasion-pcos-and-anxiety/td-p/274884

PTSD-1762,Parenting & trauma triggers,"Hello I recently had a light bulb moment and realised I am suffering PTSD. It's not like I just stumbled across the idea... I spend 90 % of my time soul searching and wondering what is wrong with me and what the purpose of life even is. I don't know whether I feel more sad or more happy now that I know what is actually wrong with me. I have had so much trauma in my life I just can't understand why me or the psychologists or dr's haven't thought of PTSD before? My Dad died when I was 8 and my bro (M) died when he was 20, Both suicided. But it's alot more complicated than that, obviously. I experienced domestic violence by both, and I lived in fear that me or my mum or my other younger bro (P) would die. M would hurt P the most and I was the one who always saved him and helped him even though M was very strong. Anyway, I have a 3 year old and 17 month old and I am struggling BIG TIME. And whenever they cry or whinge (which is all the time) I get triggered and my body just flips out. Like I can't handle it, I can't think straight and I do anything to stop them from crying. This is causing them to depend on me because i am hovering trying to avoid the noise and crying and upset, and it's just making it worse. I guess now my body just remembers my previous experiences and whenever I hear crying my brain just goes into fight/flight mode. I am constantly in overdrive and on edge and i'm so frigging exhausted all the time and I feel like I have no space in my brain. I'm booked in to see my psych this week (who I have seen only 3 times before) and also an alternative healing session. I look forward to connecting with others here, and would love to talk to others who experienced trauma during childhood and are now triggered as a parent. Thanks for reading.

PTSD-1763,"Going it alone... PTSD, cPTSD and undiagnosed panic disorder?","Im new here. A bit at my wits end to be honest. There's no one I can talk to that Im not a burden to. I was diagnosed with PTSD after an ""event""in 2012. A little after with cPTSD too. People say PTSD is with you for life. I thought I was different. I just went through a time of very mild symptoms and thought I must have cured myself through mindfulness and meditation. I was even off meds for the last two years. Managing with therapy, meditation, mindfulness and exercise. A little mild mania or anxiety but for months I had a reprieve. I guess at the least I'm lucky compared to some. But It turns out I'm not special. PTSD has come back and kicked my arse. I'm struggling to think, communicate, nightmares, crying, panic attacks and dissociating, hyper vigilant, isolating, feel safer alone, and just had to end a new relationship. I've had to take time off work again. All because I watched something on Tv that triggered me. I don't have a support network (no friends or family) beyond my therapist and I live alone with my dog. I work in law enforcement (interestingly none of my trauma is work related, I'm shit magnet outside of work!) so that's not exactly an industry leading the way in terms of support for people with PTSD. My last boss did his best to have me fired because of it. My idea of socialising is to go to the health food shop and chat with the woman that owns it. Or go to yoga. One yoga class this week I cried for 50% of my class. Probably because I saw my therapist the same day. I asked her for some suggestions to aid me in a technique where you imagine your most loved and supportive people all surrounding you and really imagine the love and supportive feelings they give you. Something to draw on in lonely dark times. It's a great resource. IF you have supportive people in your life. I asked her how might I go about this technique given I don't have anyone. She suggested imagining someone entirely new that would give and love and support in all the ways I need. For a second I thought this could work. But broke down at the thought of being so lonely and broken and pathetic that at the age of 37 I have to conjure an ""imaginary friend"" to feel connected and loved . So for the length of my yoga class I imagined what my new friend would wear. What he would look like, how he would listen to me and what he would say to me in support. And I cried and cried. On the plus side I have this new imaginary friend.

PTSD-1764,PTSD from natural disaster as a child,I was 10 when I was caught in a bushfire which destroyed our home in 1965. I stood in the house waiting to die. We walked out through the smouldering bush after the fire front past. Afterwards I felt guilty for not doing anything to help eg gathering photos etc as they were all lost. In those days you were expected to get back to 'normal'life straight away. Life was never the same as we moved away to a new area were it was hard to make friends. I struggled on my own to overcome many challenges eg learning to use a match to light a stove or fire took several years and I felt very embarrassed about it. I compensated for my guilt feelings and poor self esteem by working hard to achieve goals such as high academic results and also by helping people (particularly my parents). My mother became disabled so I took over the shopping and other housework as a teenager. Later I cared for her full time for 12 years after my father died. More recent bushfires including Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday have been close to us (sparks & embers landing in our garden) thus stirring up bad memories. I react strongly to reports of fires even in other states. I have recently started exposure therapy to help me deal with my problem. Hot dry summers are bad for me and I recently injured myself & have had to give up work because my husband has been very ill and it became too difficult to work and care for him. This means my normal strategy of working hard to drown out the negative feelings isn't possible at the moment. I wondered if anyone else had experienced anything similar and how they dealt with it. In my case it wasn't just the traumatic event but all the losses ( including complete change of lifestyle) experienced afterwards which have had a negative impact on my mental health,Elizabeth CP,Blue Voices Member,16-12-2015,PTSD and trauma,10,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-from-natural-disaster-as-a-child/td-p/174689

PTSD-1766,Moving forward but still held back.,"Hi Guys, So I'm new to this whole forum thing, but id love to get my story out and hopefully come across some new people who have been in a similar situation and who also are dealing with some similar issues. As a young child, I was sexually abused for around 9 years, every second weekend and it has left me with serve depression, anxiety and PTSD. Everything started getting really hard after finishing school because there was no routine and my anxiety got to the point of not being able to go outside by myself. My depression took over and things started falling apart. With no idea what to do or how to help myself, I ended speaking to a family member for support and guidance. I was eventually guided and convinced to go to the police and make a statement, which 3 years later and many court dates has left me to my final court date early next month to finally put the perpetrator away for the time he deserves. During court, he had been found guilty for all 5 charges and I finally felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. During the whole court process, I have been studying online, completing a certificate 3 in animal companion services. I have 3 more electives to complete and work experience, but I feel like it all wont be completed in time- before mid July. I'm so worried and scared to start work experience because of being terrified about making mistakes and if I don't my course completed, I feel like I'm going to let my family down. But these past three years have been mentally draining, exhausting and everything in between. Anyways, this post was just to try and find out if anyone out there is in a similar situation as id love to hear your stories and hopefully gain some new friends who understand how I feel.

PTSD-1767,Is recovery from PTSD even possible?,"Hi all I struggle with PTSD, depression and anxiety. I had a very toxic upbringing in a cult with emotional and physical abuse, including neglect from a lack of nutrition and being denied education. I am now in my late 20's and I cannot think of a year I have not existed through that has not involved one trauma or another. Frequent Homelessness, bullying, sexual assault, grief and loss, social isolation, abusive relationships. These are just some of the things. I have engaged with psychologists over the years but haven't found a way to come to terms with my trauma. Currently I am on a low dose of anti-anxiety medication which takes the edge off and enables me to get out of bed to go to the toilet but I still struggle to leave the house unless I have been drinking. I self medicate on alcohol a fair bit. I have limited family support but I do have a support worker who sees me once a week and a good GP. I would like to be a contributing member of society and I'd like an occupation. But I feel numb and devoid of passion and I also have very low self worth, and have no motivation at all to care about myself, almost to a point I'm afraid of caring for myself. I did used to have a fight inside me to get past all the really bad things but I seem to have lost it and I don't know how to get it back. I live in regional WA so services are limited. I don't know how to move past all of this numbness and paralysing fear, this apathy and lack of motivation. I see a psychologist but I can only see him once a month due to his availability.

As she was abused by her brother when she was a child as well. I had a few traumatic relationships over the years. I never felt the support of my parents or understanding growing up and to add to that dealing with rejection, abandonment and anxiety issues from relationships. I recently started dating someone. I was anxious about dating but he must have gotten into my head. We werent dating for long before he told me out of the blue we would be better as friends. This has been extremely traumatising because he made me believe that i was actually worth it. He was the luckiest guy. He really liked me. Everything seemed botmal one day then the next it was all unexpected. Some of my friends dont seem to understand. None is around for me but when they need someone im always the person to put everything down.

They all became a group including my husband and pushed me towards postnatal depression. they are gone back to their home but they break our husband wife relationship. Now my husband believe that whatever happens in those two months we're only my mistake. now my husband treats me very badly. He sometimes says that you should die.. he mentally abusing me. I don't know what to do. I am trying to focus on my newborn baby but my husband gives me so much stress that I can't take care of my baby 100%. his parents wants us to have divorce. My husband also wants the same but I am the only one who is trying to keep this marriage. but sometimes I feel tired of doing efforts and tired of this mental abuse. i don't know what to do. But for sure I am not thinking about suicide coz I want the love be for my baby. However my husband tried a lot to make me commit suicide but I didn't listen to him. my biggest concern is that if something happens to me then is there a possibility that I can make a will saying that my baby should Iive with my husband or my family but not with my husbands family. i am asking this because I know that if I die then my husband will not take care of my baby, he will give our baby to his sister and parents. they are not nice people. They already killed one of my child. I don't want them to have my baby and then to kill later.",Gudia,Community Member,22-03-2017,PTSD and trauma,8,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/fully-stressed-out-with-marriage-and-worried-about-newborn-baby/td-p/269646
PTSD-1778,When does the good stuff start?,"I have suffered from anxiety and depression for nearly all of my adult life but only first sought professional help ten years ago. My depressive episodes come and go and, I was in the midst of another struggle which began late last year. One day in January I was having a bad day at work so went for a walk at lunch time to get some fresh air and try to change my mindset. Unfortunately, I just happened to be in the Bourke St mall just at the exact moment the car drove through killing six people and injuring dozens more. I know there is no good time to witness that sort of thing but this was the worst possible moment, when I was already in a bad place. I have struggled to sleep without medication since that day. The following week I started seeing a counsellor through work as well as my own psychiatrist but am really struggling to work through everything. As an introvert who suffers from anxiety I find life a difficult experience at the best of times. Getting through a typical day of dealing with people and the world in general is draining and exhausting. Right now I'm struggling to see what the point of it is. The sessions with my psychiatrist have been difficult in that they are uncovering that I haven't dealt with the past. At my last session my psych told me that she'd never come across anyone more controlled by fear than me. I've always known about my problems in that area but this made me feel that I am beyond help. I'm not sort of person who would take his own life but if somebody told that when I went to sleep tonight I would not wake up I wouldn't be unhappy. I am struggling to think of what I would be missing out on.",remboy,Community Member,14-03-2017,PTSD and trauma,12,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/when-does-the-good-stuff-start/td-p/256106
PTSD-1779,I'm really lonely and just wanted to connect,"I'm really tired. I'm feeling really lonely. I have a lot of grief to still get through. Its been years. I'm so tired of having to work through trauma, watching for triggers. Dealing with the fall out of being triggered. I lost two friends over the last few months and I'm now down to none. This puts a lot of pressure on my partner. I find it really hard to connect with people. I find it hard to be emotionally vulnerable with people. I turned 40 last month, and after years of friendship (long distance a few calls a week) known each other for 30 odd years, she forgot my birthday. Sent me a text to apologise, when I asked her what happened, she just disappeared. Ghosted. The pattern I have found is that as long as I'm supporting or showing interest in them they stick around as soon I may start opening up and looking for support or advice or just to have a vent, they disappear. It then gets harder and harder to connect. I'm sad and feel alone tonight. I just couldn't bring myself to call anyone, the reality is, I don't really have anyone to call.

PTSD-1780,[TRIGGER WARNING: domestic violence] my dad and his siblings won't listen to reason.,"Hi, I'll try to explain properly so bear with me. So my little sister and I currently moved out of my father's house due to his anger issues. Since our mum passed almost 2 years ago, it's just been us three. My dad and I have had some arguments here and there about small things like household chores and stuff like that, and since last year, he's been blaming my 'change' of attitude because i've had a boyfriend, which is not true. Every time that happens, my dad would start to raise his voice and I would try to be calm but when I talk to him, I just get really frustrated. Also, the way that he sometimes asks us to do something for him is more of like a command to do what he wants to be done. He's very strict and he just loves to complain about what we do wrong, even a tiny bit, to his sisters. I am 23 and my sister is 12 and the three of us has depression. Anyways, this past Sunday, something happened. It's a bit hard to explain, but my sister was in the kitchen when all of a sudden I hear her yell out in pain because my dad punched her in the arm and I heard her yell out, ""Stop, what are you doing?"" then she ran towards her room. Just so you know, these kinds of things happened before when it gets bad but we let it slide because he's still our father and he never lets us forget that, but this time, I saw my dad run towards her room and try to break down her door, saying things like, ""I'll kill you"" and just full on swore at her. I told him to calm down but he kept saying things that really cut to the core. He said that it was her fault that our mum passed away because of stress from processing her adoption papers. Also, he keeps saying that he regrets bringing her here in the country and some other hurtful things that you never say to a 12-year-old much less your own daughter. Mind you, he has said these things to me too. It hurt a lot and I told him that but he said it's just words. ""I don't mean it and I would never do anything to harm my daughters."" So now, after a few hours, we snuck out and went to our elder sister's house because we don't feel safe there anymore. His sisters kept calling us and blaming me for everything that happened a few days ago, even though I keep telling them that he THREATENED TO KILL US. They said that it's normal to be angry and say those things and my sister and I should just say sorry and forget about it. Did we do the right thing? I feel bad for leaving but we really don't feel safe there anymore.

PTSD-1782,PTSD Hallucinations,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. A person I know has had several visits to the hospital, the hospital is saying there is nothing wrong with her but a doctor is saying because of a mentally abusive relationship and, issues involving her kids that she is has PTSD Hallucinations. This has been happening very frequently, strange things like eating fish food, trying to drink hair conditioner, buttering her shoe with butter, thinking she is making a cake whilst sitting on the floor, putting a towel into the toilet, possibly thinking it was a washing machine, she was off to the beach and is back in 1993 even though we are in 2017. All of this is happening and last for about 12 hours. For many years she has been a very heavy drinker, but not every day drinker but when she did could go on a bender for a couple of days. She has spent time in Rehab a few times. I believe she no longer drinks, but I know she has been on prescription medication. My question is, can a person experience things like I have mentioned from PTSD, or do you think some kids of drug/prescription medication is getting used. Some people are convinced it is PTSD, but I am not. She can function on days perfect then hours later is completely unaware of what is going on around her.

PTSD-1783,When other survivors of abuse won't talk to you,"I really hope this post doesn't come off as selfish - please read to the end! I was abused by a medical professional in the early 1980s (10yrs to 13 yrs old). I've discovered a group of older women who were also abused by this person in late 60s & 70s, but they are all about 10-15 years older than me. but is seems no one now wants to talk about it. I wonder if when you are around your 40s (like I am), is when this kind of trauma hits you the worst. And maybe they've all been through that stage and just don't want to revisit it. I don't know. But I feel like I'm an outsider of a group. I'm going to the Royal Commission later this week and I'm feeling terribly alone about the whole thing. I know one of the other lady's has also gone to the RC and I was hoping we could discuss it before I go. However she got one of her friends to email me to say she was unable to support me as she's going through a tough time. Naturally I have to accept this, but it hurts me. Guess I just wanted peoples thoughts on this forum, as to whether they've experienced a similar thing. regards, Super",SuperSonic,Community Member,03-05-2017,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/when-other-survivors-of-abuse-won-t-talk-to-you/td-p/291503
PTSD-1784,Disillusioned by Pursuit of Happiness,"overwhelmed by the realisation that my whole life has been full of grief & loss.why can't I let go of it, or get over it! I just want to be happy! Then it hit me like a flash of lightning.Some things in life that happen to us, some losses we will never completely heal or get over in this life. There will be times when out of blue triggers will come &grief will slap you hard in the face again&knock you off your feet! But we don't need to struggle or fight against it, we just need to accept it! It's like being in the ocean, fighting, struggling against the crushing waves- you just exhaust yourself &drown quicker. Grief is like the waves of the ocean, if you fight against it&struggle we will just exhaust ourselves & drown. It's better to just let the waves of grief roll over you& learn to just ride the wave until it brings you into shore. I think what I realised today is that sometimes our intense pursuit of happiness is to avoid feeling the pain from the bad things that happened to us. We want to feel good! I think as humans we expect to be happy all the time&yet today I seen that that pursuit of happiness is actually what disillusions is.I realised that the pursuit of happiness is unattainable&unrealistic! We cannot be happy ALL the time, nor can we live in a constant state of happiness. It's not normal.It is possible to come to a place of contentment in life, where you learn to be content with life.I realised we have MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS"" rather than constant HAPPINESS.Making that distinction that we have MOMENTS of happiness rather then that pursuit of happiness has really helped me! I no longer feel the need to pursue happiness as such.It's helped me to make peace with it &also peace with my loss&grief!I accept that everyone has their moments of loss, grief, everyone has their moments of happiness. Buts that's all they are MOMENTS.There will be times when the waves of grief wash over us but we don't need to fight & struggle against it! We just need to learn to ride the wave until it passes.Sometimes we need to accept that the grief, trauma in our lives leave us with a limp&we may just have to learn to walk the rest of our life with a limp but we just keep walking. And when we have a crap day, we just let it happen.Seeing it as MOMENTS is very liberating,I don't have to fight anymore! I don't have to fight against grief or fight for happiness because both will inevitably come to me- it's called life!",TBella,Community Member,03-05-2017,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/disillusioned-by-pursuit-of-happiness/td-p/291133
PTSD-1785,Over being judged & misunderstood,"Well I emailed my sister last night to share a breakthrough I had re: not feeling like I have fight against grief or fight for happiness- I just accept both will come. My sister emails me back giving me long lecture on happiness is a choice, we make our own happiness. I emailed her back to explain that it's not as simple as a choice to be happy when you have mental illness. I explained my experience in the last 5 years with PTSD, in order to help her understand. She sends me an angry email back saying she doesn't believe in all that stuff- mental illness, PTSD are just labels so you don't have to take responsibility for your life & can play the victim coz safe being a victim & she hopes her email makes me angry, angry enough to stop being a victim. Ouch!!! It really hurts, I made myself so vulnerable & she shut me down! I'm fed up being told how I should feel or not feel! And now I'm worried for her kids, as two of them have shared with me their own struggles with mental illness & how they tried to talk to their mum but she shuts them down because she refuses to accept mental illness is real- according to her mental illness is a choice! Yeah we choose to have PTSD coz it's safe! Pfft! Ask anyone with PTSD & they will tell you they don't feel safe. The most concerning thing about all this is she is a nurse! Clearly classically text book trained. It makes me feel sad &I isolated - like no one gets me or understands! It makes me want to never open up & share how I'm really feeling coz I'm sick of dealing with ignorance, arrogance & people intolerance to accept people with mental illness. And I'm over Being judged by people especially family who don't even take the time to see how I am or what's going on in my life.

PTSD-1786,Fear of death after car accident,"I was a passenger in a serious car accident at the start of this year, and since then I'm always afraid of death. Basically a bunch of my friends and I went to a backstreet that is notorious for hooning and one of the guys was mucking around in his car. Each of my friends took turns being a passenger and I was against it at first, but then decided to take a ride too. At first it was all fine, but then he decided to fishtail down a hill and it didn't take long before he lost control. We went sideways into two poles and then rolled into a ditch. It was the most frightening experience of my life and when the car came to a halt I thought I had died. It all happened so quickly but I still remember every thought that rushed through my head as it happened. All I could think about was my mum and that everything was over. Against all odds I was almost completely uninjured except for a split eyebrow, but I still can't go a day without thinking about it. I panic when I'm in a car with my friends, I panic when I'm on the train, I panic when I'm trying to fall asleep. I have had many dreams about car crashes and plane crashes lately. My dad takes planes weekly and I now worry each time that I'll never see him again. The event that stood out to me the most was when I recently went to the beach with my family. I have always loved the water and I'd swim out right through heavy waves. This time, I was in the water for about 5mins with pretty small waves and I panicked and got out of the water because I was too afraid of dying. I was never afraid of death before, but now it seems to be something I worry about every day. I just want things to go back to normal. I talk to my mum about it and she thinks I should see a professional for at least a few sessions, but I know how expensive that is and I feel bad. I'd rather use these forums.",anonymousme,Community Member,26-04-2017,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/fear-of-death-after-car-accident/td-p/274584

One is just about 4 and the other is 9 weeks old, both boys. Im currently in a relationship with a 22year old man.. and have been for a year and a half.. i would still consider myself a solo parent though. Our relationship seemed great in the start however that quickly gained all the nasties. Control , jealously , isolation , double standards,carelessness and emotional abuse. I have been called every single name .. under the sun. I have been physcially hurt. I am always rejected and pushed to one side and as of late im now living completely alone as he says his life is better without me. Every day for 3 weeks ive tried to get him back, ive stayed at his friends , ive gone backwards and forwards at ridiculous hours spent all my money trying to be by his side. When i was there.. i was basically pushed to the side the whole time although he claimed to have wanted me there. I lived for the moment he hopped in bed next to me. Even tho he went straight to sleep. I miss his companionship thats been gone for so long. I need help. I cant pull myself away. The dv has me trapped . I feel like i need him and am nothing without him.i can't eat. I cant sleep. I hate waking up. I hatethinking. I cant stop thinking. I feel so trapped within myself and i am always looking for or imagining escapes. I cant focus on my children. I never have anytime to just be me.

PTSD-1790,A thought for our diggers,"On this ANZAC Day, let's spare a thought and extend a compassionate hand to our defence people, especially those who have returned from active service only to fight a war in their own minds. Reports (source-ABC news) are that there has been a four-fold increase in PTSD cases since Australian troops first went to war in Afghanistan in 2001. Many are reluctant or unable to admit that they have PTSD. Many do not report their symptoms. The suicide toll amongst returned service people is now three times that of Australia's combat losses in Afghanistan. Other figures show that around 20 per cent of returned soldiers develop mental health problems within three months of being home, and that's just the ones who have come forward. Others battle silently, developing alcohol and drug problems as they fight their mental war alone. It is also estimated that 10 per cent of Australia's homeless population are returned service people, usually with serious mental health and substance abuse problems. To any defence people reading this, firstly I say thank you. Thank you! And know that you are amongst friends here, people who have not and cannot begin to know what you know or see what you've seen, but people who know about fighting a mental war in ourselves. I for one would like to shake your hand, and then hold it tight through your dark hours. On this forum you will always be welcome, supported and safe to open up and share your pain.

I got another job but it didnt feel supported and I decided to move back to my original state as my ex partner is now in jail and my family are here. I got a job as a Manager of a small family own business with a male owner, I witnessed the owner speak very badly to my 2 female colleagues on a number of occasions and then he also did it to me, he wouldn't yell he would ridicule and be very sarcastic. At this point I started to feel like I couldn't relax my body my shoulders would be so tight and I had mega pains under my ribs, this has continued for the 9 months I was at the job which I have since left. I have since become aware that my ex partner is due to be released from prison on 25/4 so I obtained a VRO. Last week I was advised that it is likely he will be deported but I won't know this for sure for another couple of weeks. My ex has objected to the restraining order - this is the first contact I have had in 3 years as I closed any form of contact because he is such a psychopath. I went to a GP yesterday and he has referred me to a clinical Psychologist as he believes I have PTSD. I have made an appointment with the psych for next week I was really just wanting some support and some tips on how to manage my crazy body. I am not working atm as I want to get myself well.

PTSD-1792,Abuse Survivor Stories: How did you learn to love yourself after?,"I am 23 years old, and recently gotten out of a two years abusive relationship. It has been a month since I left him and currently proud that I am in no contact. My ex was much older than me, and for the most part, he appeared very charming, loving and the perfect one in the beginning of the relationship. I should have recognise the signs such as he controlling ways, possessiveness and jealousy in the beginning but I took that as he cared and wanted to be a part of my life because he loved me. He kept me on a high from the start controlling when I could see him. Things took a bad turn when we started living together, then came the verbal swearing, the punching of walls and blaming me for everything that externally went wrong. I was accused of cheating and he started using my past which I opened up to him about early on and he was the one who asked me to tell him. I had two jobs then, and he asked me to quit one job promising that he wants to take care of me and spend more time with me only to blame me when we are financially short. Then came the physical abuse, and by then time, I was in trouble. He started by hitting me every once in two months, and the cycle got shorter. He used to apologise everytime after he hit me but it got shorter. As he switches from loving me, hitting me the next and then loving me again within a span of an hour. To make things worst he was a professional fighter and he was much bigger than me. Four weeks ago, I nearly suffocated and died when he a I was in hospital. The police had to arrest him, despite so he tells everyone that it was my fault and I deserve to be hit and made false accusations on social media against me.

""please please come home please"" things i asked everyday i remember, i remember the pain, i remember the trauma. i remember the loneliness, every night at 3am when i am still struggling to sleep because i dont know where you are, one more quick burst out of tears and show myself more self hate before i cry myself to sleep. the last 6 months hes been clean and sobar and back to his old amazing self, however im jus finding myself wanting to get away from him. i want to live separate without actually breaking up, i never gave myself the space i needed to heal myself and the trauma i went through for so long, i need time to miss him. hes so insecure because of his own fuck ups that its now taking its toll on me on another level and i am mentally drained. i just want to this so much but im so lost with how, doing so seems like a fairy tale",Luka-_Ann,Community Member,16-04-2017,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/starting-to-suffer-ptsd-my-partner-is-the-reason-why/td-p/277535

I am becoming reclusive and live like a hermit except for my dog and I am thinking about giving her up because I don't want her to be harmed. I feel like I'm living in some sort of prison, where everything I do or make is stolen or damaged in some way.

PTSD-1799,Assault/Anxiety - how to move on? [TRIGGER WARNING: SEXUAL ASSAULT],"Hi all, I'm not really sure where to begin, but about 4 months ago I was sexually assaulted by a guy I was seeing. We had been seeing each other for about 2 months and had a very complicated, but intense, relationship due to the fact that I was still healing from a previous 3-year relationship in which I had been severely emotionally-abused (gas-lighting, triangulation, lies, theft, silent treatment, you name it). The guy in question was under the influence of drugs when the assault took place and therefore couldn't remember it. When I confronted him about it the next day, he told me I was a liar and a perpetual victim. A week later, he told me he didn't feel anything for me anymore, that I was a terrible person, and then he cut me out of his life completely. Honestly, the things he did in the aftermath were more hurtful to me than the actual assault. I was seriously shattered by his behaviour but decided that the only thing I could do was focus on myself. My psychologist has helped me immensely in dealing with everything, and I am no longer depressed, with panic attacks becoming fewer and far between. My life at the moment is also very fulfilling. I do full-time uni, work 2 jobs, have a volunteer position at a mental health facility, and have 2 major holidays planned for this year. I also try to exercise regularly and maintain my hobby of writing. My anxiety, however, is still almost debilitating. My entire body is constantly tense and sometimes shaking, my sleep is shallow and unsatisfying so I am tired all the time, the smallest disappointment can send me spiralling off into a mini depressive-episode, I constantly have headaches, etc. Basically, what I am trying to say is that even though my life appears to going great, I still feel pretty horrible all the time, and I don't know how to make it better because I feel like I am doing everything right. One thing that I would also like to mention is that I still constantly miss the guy who assaulted me, and that makes my anxiety worse because I feel like there must be something wrong with me to miss someone who did that to me, especially when it has been 4 months since it happened and I only really knew him for 2 months. We go to the same university as well, so I see him often and every time he pretends I'm not there and it makes me feel terrible. So I guess what I'm asking is, what tips do you guys have for improving anxiety without medication, and how do I get over this guy? Thanks so much in advance.",sydneyharbour17,Community Member,09-04-2017,PTSD and trauma,14,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/assault-anxiety-how-to-move-on-trigger-warning-sexual-assault/td-p/329229
PTSD-1800,Where to start?,"So I took my son to a social worker a couple of weeks ago and after talking to her for an hour she cracks my shell and tells me I have deep anxiety issues that I need to deal with (in a nice way), I knew I had things going on in my head but nothing that I thought was oozing from my being for others to see. Then she asks me if Im always this anxious (which I never noticed or understood I was) and somehow all of a sudden it all makes sense and I burst into tears as she gets me and understands that its hardwork being me. All a little bit daunting considering I was there to get help for master 2 and turns out I need to help myself to be able to relax and deal with his issues effectively. I always noticed when I didnt feel comfortable I would be out of breath (even if on a phone call or talking to a friend), that my mind doesnt ever shut off (I just thought others managed their thoughts better than I do) and that I get on edge, flustered & emotional when things are out of my control also that I fight to the end if life throws me a challenge (I had many different testing times and obstacles in my 35 years). I guess Im writing this to try to learn out more about myself and to understand and manage my mind and what I have always thought was normal but turns out there is more going on up there than your average joe.",K8k,Community Member,12-04-2017,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/where-to-start/td-p/332041

PTSD-1803,Leaving a domestic violent relationship and how to move on,"Hi. Just wondering if anyone can please give me some helpful advice on how I mend this heart of mine. I left a 12 year violent relationship just short of 7 months ago. He was the father of my children, fiance and love of my life. My ex Fiance is now in prison for the horrible things he has done to our family. I am left shattered, numb, anxious, depressed and still in disbelief that the person I loved so much could treat me the way he did. I have a great support network but at the end of the day I am alone with my tears and heartache raising our children on my own whilst working and studying part time. I am good at hiding how I feel (most of the time) so every one thinks I am ok or I am happy.I am not! I completely feel crushed that I held on for so long and nothing changed. Why do I still love and miss this person?? I'm not holding on to memories. .because there wasn't many good ones. It is not because he was the father of my children either as there was not many good memories of love there also. HOW do I stop loving the one person who never loved me the way I loved him. How do I move on from his abuse, infidelity and guilt because he is where he is now. I have days where I am on top of the world as a single independent woman/mother who no longer has to be controlled...then I have more days where I go home and sit on the laundry floor crying once the kids are in bed. I also have days where I still miss him terribly and for the life of me I Cannot pinpoint what it is I actually miss! Terribly lost, please help me see sense.

PTSD-1804,"My brother, my dad & now my beautiful sister. Years of grief!","Hi there, I have just become a member here at BB in hope that I may find some help dealing with my feelings of having lost my closest family members. The trauma of loss begun when I was 25. I lost my brother in a car accident 9 years ago. I lost my father to a heart attack 5 years ago. Now just last October I lost my sister to suicide. It seems she took her life on the anniversary of our brothers passing. I am just broken! The first time I am using the work suicide is just now in this forum. I have not been able say it allowed yet to people. Denial, I don't know?!? I was my sisters 'carer'. She has suffered mental illness for many years but over the last year she has been so well & I simply did not see this coming. Again I am broken. She has 3 children, two daughters in their 20's & my nephew who has just turned 15. Although my sister loved each & every one of her kids, it was my nephew she worried about the most. I have taken him under my wing & have him most weekends now. We talk a lot about his mum, my sister & our loss however it is still just so difficult for us both. I feel a debt to my sisiter to make sure he & her girls are ok, all while I am trying to deal with my own grief. It's so hard! The loss of my sister is raw. I am not healed from the grief of losing Dad & my brother, & now my sister. How do I go on missing them all? I feel so sad & I cry every day when I am on my own. I have nightmares, most recently about my sister as I had to formerly identify her after I called the police worried about her that day. I go to work everyday & put on a brave face. I feel if I didn't do that, depression would set in. I am being brave for the kids & for my mum however now it's getting harder. I feel so sad that I have lost my beautiful sister this way. Although my grief for my brother & my dad still pains me, the way I lost them I have accepted was out of my control. My sisters death I have not accepted, at all. I feel so sad that she was in such a dark place & I was not by her side to pull her through in this most recent darkest moment. I was always there for her through her hard times & despite having suffered mental illness on & off I never once thought her to be suicidle. How nieave of me! It would have taken one phone call from me that day to her to know how she was feeling, it could have changed everything.

PTSD-1805,First step (trigger warning: sexual assault),"Hello.. I've visited this site several times over the past few years, wanting to join, wanting to feel the relief of connection that shared suffering can bring, longing for an anonymous voice that could blurt out all my woes and worries to an anonymous ear. But each time I stopped myself. Compared to some of the posts I read, my situation and my feelings seemed so normal. I was just being a wimp or a drama queen, and my depression would surely wane as it always has in the past. I can cope. I will self-help myself out of this limbo life somehow. This morning, as I lay in bed crying again and knowing that I would probably spend another lost day not doing anything, not seeing anyone and not moving far from my bed and laptop, I at last realized that I'm not coping and that maybe it's time to seek help from others. It's been over three months since I've had energy to do anything. I've just scored 'High""on the Q10, and been advised to see my GP. I don't have one, and even if I did, the motivation to get to them just isn't there. I used to do regular gardening and send myself to sleep with hypnotherapy recordings every night, now I just lay in bed, addicted to the cyberspace screen and staying cocooned from the real world. I do volunteer work one day a week. It's the only day I venture out and pretend to be OK. It's a real effort. I feel as though I am waiting to die, and some days I am really impatient for him to arrive and take me. There are of course life experiences that have led me to this state, but my stories are not unique. My prolonged inability to steer my thoughts and body into healthier directions is what worries me. I'm not used to asking for help, but if someone can reassure me that 'this too shall pass' I'd be really grateful.",New_Moon,Community Member,01-04-2017,PTSD and trauma,18,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/first-step-trigger-warning-sexual-assault/td-p/278737

PTSD-1807,I have thoughts that the whole world is conspiring against me,"Hey all, I was diagnosed with PTSD and severe anxiety and severe depression about a year ago. I was in a motorbike accident which attributed to the PTSD back in Jan 2007, after nearly a 10 year long ice addiction I felt enough was enough and I kicked that habit around 18 months ago. In the time since I quit I have stayed strong to not go back to it despite learning these things since stopping and I've done well in that regards. I have been seeing a psychologist for the past 12 months, fort nightly, but I seem to just be getting worse and worse and it's now at the point in which I don't care for what happens to me at all anymore and I can't keep going on, I've lost 3 jobs in the past 6 months because half the time I can't even bring myself to get out of bed or out of the house. I have been given a script today for anti depressants and benzodiazepenes to deal with the anxiety when needed. My issue is I feel like this kind of medication is designed by governments/big pharma companies to dumb people down/control people/make them conform etc.. And whilst I know people that it has been helpful for, I can't get the thoughts out of my head that it's all just a front from the corporations to conspire against the population.

PTSD-1809,PTSD & separation,"Hello, i am a survivor of schild sexual abuse that left me with depression (or so I believed at the time) 25 years later I was finally given justice for my trauma with a long jail sentence. I'm not actually sure the work I put in was worth it. I'm doubt most would agree but I should have just let sleeping dogs lie so to speak. I was doing ok before it was all rehashed out in a court room. Although I've always suffered depression I have since realised I now have PTSD. I'm not sure if it's always been that or just got worse due to the case being reopened. So there's a small run down of my screwed up life. I am now 35 years old and I've spent 15 years with the man I couldn't/can't imagine my life without. We've had our ups and downs obviously but he just doesn't deserve the way I am. I can't trust, I can't open up and let him in. He loves me I know this but he can't show it and I can't believe him say it! So we are now 2 weeks into a separation and I feel like I'm going crazy. I just want to run and wrap him up in my arms and tell him how much I do love him but I'm so unwell mentally that I can't because he is better off without me. The thought of not being with him shatters me though. I have been fighting these demons alone for so many years and pushed so many people away that I think I'm just better off alone at this point. I just miss him so much it physically hurts. I don't know what to do? I don't know how to love him like he deserves and how to get help so maybe one day I can possibly feel loved and needed. I have a warped sense of love, my looks and my own personal struggles impacted him so much that he simply is best to stay away I know that, he knows it but I don't think I can even keep breathing at this point.",Punkey,Community Member,18-03-2017,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-separation/td-p/261564
PTSD-1810,Feeling ok.,"Hi everyone, in a previous post I said my marriage was over and I couldn't breathe, that I was going to psych and trying to finally get my PTSD under control. We I've seen a psych a couple of times now, he is amazing. We were able to talk a lot about what's been going on in my life (I find it really hard to open up). We discussed so much stuff that the first time I came out a mess. I was almost screaming in pain it was so hard. But the 2nd time I came out refreshed and better. I came out with a game plan and an idea of what I can do to help me everyday. At the moment that is replacing negative thoughts with good ones. So when I look in the mirror and think I'm fat and horrid, I replace it with I'm perfect weight and my stomach is flabby due to 4 beautiful children I created it's really helping. I feel heaps better already. Still a long way to go but I'm sure I will get there. Update on my marriage. My husband is being an amazing support, even from his mothers house. He is constantly finding out more information on PTSD so he can better understand it. He tells me 10+ times a day how much he loves me and that he will not leave me for something out of my control ever. He will stay with his Mum until I am able to make a mentally stable decision about us but will not be going anywhere that doesn't include me and our children! Now that I'm felling better I believe him. If I start to question it I tell him that I need a reminder. He now understands and is working with me to make me well. Together we will beat the demons inside my head x I hope everyone is having a good day, if not know that you're not alone.",Punkey,Community Member,01-04-2017,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/feeling-ok/td-p/278599
PTSD-1811,Life is a funny thing,"Life is funny. I grew up most of my life without a mother, she killed herself when I was 7 years old; although this was tough, I always looked at the positives in life and continued pushing forward. I found this hard at times in my life, my dad had also had multiple alcoholic suicide attempts, he would go through stages for months where he'd be blind drunk from dusk to dawn and then some. I was around 9 at this time and it happened all the way up to when I was 16, in stages, not consecutively. In my final year of school, one month to go; my dad was sentenced to 3 years in jail with potential of bail after 8 months. That left me lost, angry, sad, dissapointed an overwhelming feeling of emotions that I had never felt before. I remember thinking to myself ""Why me?"" I still think that to this day. People say everything happens for a reason, to learn a lesson but that's what school is for; me suffering through then suicide of my mother and all the things that happened with my father wasn't a lesson. It was pure pain. I'm sitting here today, 19 days till my 18th birthday, I lost my best friend a few days ago, and my job yesteday. Dreams of being a pilot but unable to achieve them, the government put a pause on VET FEE HELP which means I have to come up with 80k to put myself to flight school, working a minimum wage job with my only qualifcation being a year 12 certificate. While everyone else was deciding what they wanted to do with their life, I was trying to figure out how to pay rent, and pay for food and basically be a parent to myself because no one else could. I feel lost, people know my situation but no one cares. ""I'm sorry that happened to you"" the amount of times I've heard those words now make them meaningless. I feel nothing but sadness and pain rush through my bloodstream but I value life too much to make that pain go away. I can't sleep properly, every day I wake up and it feels like a dark cloud is following me everywhere I go, I can't see properly; life seems blurry and all I want to do is move away and start fresh, but I can't. I can't because I don't have the funds to, because I'm stuck paying for my life through centerlink and 14 dollar an hour jobs. Australia used to be a land of opportunites but now it just feels like hell. I've seen a therapist it doesn't help, i've talked to family it doesn't help.

This version of me feels like I've always been heavy... weighted down with underlying sadness.

PTSD-1815,Was it actually abuse?,"A couple at my church who are some of my close friends, have been very involved in helping me deal with my ex husbands affairs and abuse and move forward. However over time the husband became very flirtatious with me. We engaged in a lot of flirtatious talk and texts that was generally playful, but started to make me uncomfortable. I liked the attention because it made me feel noticed and like someone might actually want me after the way my husband treated me and the affairs he’d had. But I also felt disgusted by that feeling, because I didn’t really want to be wanted by my friend because he was married. Then it progressed to him physically touching me in a sexual way. I perpetuated a lot of this because at first I simply liked the attention and physically my body 'wanted it' even though I really didn't want it from him and I think its a disgusting and despicable thing to do to my friend & their marriage. I wanted affection from him in the form of hugs and safe male contact, but when he started touching me more inappropriately it felt really wrong and went against everything I believe, but my body still wanted him to keep going and that makes me a really horrible person. I did repeatedly ask him to stop and push his hands away, but he would keep going and I wasn’t very forceful because I didn’t want to disappoint him or stop him from wanting to be my friend, which is pathetic. I was scared of losing his attention or affection at all, so I didn’t make myself as forceful as I wanted to be or definitely as I should have been.",QuinnH,Community Member,11-03-2017,PTSD and trauma,10,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/was-it-actually-abuse/td-p/214554
PTSD-1816,When a community is destroyed,"I am looking for help coping with the loss of hundreds of my neighbours and local supports in a short time frame due to the wholesale sell off of social housing in what was previously a very strong, successful community. I have joined with others asking the government to let our elders and people with disability to age in place but the minister is very positional and not engaged.

PTSD-1818,ABC Australian Story - Nikki Gemmal 20/03/2017,"I've just watched the Australian Story documentary about the Australian writer Nikki Gemmal's struggle to understand her mother's suicide after her mother had suffered for years with chronic pain. By her own admission, Nikki did not understand her mother's agony, her pain, or her need to alleviate her pain by suiciding without troubling her family. Nikki's story raised many issues that confront all families when it comes to planning for pain or death. But one of the saddest issues raised was the lack of communication between family members. I've lost a grandmother and a father to heart disease; a mother, a brother-in-law and a niece to bowel cancer and a beautiful husband to emphysema. I said ""Good-bye"" to my Grandmother the day before she died. I had visited my brother-in-law and my niece in palliative care the morning before they died. I was on a plane home when my father died and I will always regret not having made that trip earlier. I was with my husband when he died. The nurse sitting with us said: ""Talk to him. His hearing will be the last sense to go"". I spent the last minutes of his life telling him how much I loved him, how much he had enriched our lives, how much I had loved the years we had spent together. He died quietly and calmly and I feel eternally grateful that I shared that last moment with him. I was at my mother's hospital bedside when she died. Her last words were: ""Have I been a good mother?"" I told her she had been the best mother any daughter could have asked for. I live eternally with the grief and loss of my family members. But I have had the privilege of sharing the deaths of my husband and my mother. I believe both died knowing how much they were loved. Nikki Gemmal didn't have that privilege. I would urge anyone confronting the death of a loved one that you reach out and communicate to them your love and your care. You may not change the inevitable outcome, but you will provide those dying with the emotional comfort they crave. And you will be able to let them die knowing that they know how much they were loved. Grief is profound. It never leaves you. But if you can share both the living and the dying of your loved ones, then I believe you acquire a greater understanding of the existential meaning of your own life. Tell the people you love how much you love them before they have to face their death.",GBAY,Community Member,20-03-2017,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/abc-australian-story-nikki-gemmal-20-03-2017/td-p/264063
PTSD-1819,Very confused,"This is a cry for help.. I'm in a very dark place today. My 3yr old and 2yr old are at preschool today. My 1yr old is in hospital with my husband (this is her 4th week in there). I am at home alone. I am NC with my Narc mother and I do not have a father around. My best friend is overseas and my sister at school. Last Thursday at my psychologist appointment she told me my husband was abusive which was a bit of a shock to hear.. I have been thinking about it a lot and I thought maybe I have painted him wrong to her. The other day my 2yr old was playing on my phone and my husband sent a message and my son was able to respond to the message.. with the help of autocorrect etc my son wrote 3 messages ""mmm bench x"" ""she"" and one of the generic messages you can send ""ill call you later"". My husband called and my son brought the phone to me. He told me not too come up and see our daughter as he was too tired. An hour later he asked me if I was cheating on him?! He put 2+2 together and came up with 7! He didn't believe those messages where from my son playing on my phone .. I am breaking my back here trying to keep this end running and this is what he thinks? He phone last night and was asking me what's going on.. I said it's not the time to fight - we need our energy and focus on our daughter. He insisted so it was the first time EVER I have stood up for myself. I was very calm and kept my emotions at bay the whole conversation. I said I am miserable, you control every aspect of my life - the one time I decided to get a night job he counted my money to make sure I was working the hours I told him I was. He then made me ""pick"" him or my job. I obviously quit. When I brought all his up last night he told me I should have been more supportive towards his insecurities. He told me he wants to seperate for good as I am so unsupportive. He ended up calling me a bitch and I hung up. So here I am, challenged my husband for the first and that was my response..

PTSD-1820,PTSD after operation,"Hi, new to the group:) I was diagnosed with PTSD last year in August, I thought I could get better on my own then getting a referral , so I took up colouring in, it soon ended. in 2015 I had an operation to remove gallstones, operation had an error. I was sent home ill. Went to the A/E several times they ran tests and I had an abscess on my left side of my tummy and was in ICU for 9 days. The doctors say it was caused by a 'leak' I had a colostomy bag they leaked and burned my skin. I was angry at my parents, at my husband, angry at the world but I thought I had the right to feel this way. Feb 7 my daughter started Prep 1, I missed seeing that day, my son started walking I missed that, my son started talking I missed that. 4 months in hospital and after all said and done I still feel robbed. Had to learn to write again. Walk again. Remembered not a lot. The doctors had in my mind I was a bad mother and that I died. My husband later told me that I wasn't expected to live. Last feb my colostomy bag was removed! Feb 4 my daughter started grade 1 I missed it. My kids have swimming, I love the water I love chlorine I love the pool, I was so jealous of my husband that he was in the pool and I wasn't. So I'd cry then wait until we left the pool so I could leacture him that he had what I wanted. I grew up being a swimmer, and when the colostomy bag was removed I was straight to the pool. At the pool I'm relaxed, when my son has lessons I'm in that group. I'm able to swim laps I love it. I see a psychiatrist but haven't seen him for 3 weeks because I couldn't get an appointment until March. my friends that I had deserted me when I became very ill, although things picked up, none want to be my friend. i just want my life back. My husband says I'm a different person and some days he doesn't know me. One minute I'm crying the next I'm laughing. my daughter started grade 2 feb 9, I took her, it felt so great being there for her special day and to know she's in a supportive school who helped in 2015.",RebekahJayne,Community Member,23-02-2017,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-after-operation/td-p/184369

I don't know how to describe this but.. I don't really know who or what I am, I don't know what I think and feel. I don't know anything! It would appear on the outside like I am always changing my opinion or how I feel .. but I'm not really sure of it in the first place! I talk in a lots of FACTS because those I am sure of.

PTSD-1825,Needing some advice please,"Hello, I am new to posting but I am feeling VERY low tonight and really in need of some advice on how to overcome a few things. I will do my best to keep it short and will summarise a lot. I am a young mother (I have 3 children). Growing up I lived in quite an abusive household. My mother is a narcissist and she was verbally, mentally, emotionally and physically abusive. I have been no contact with her now for 3 months as she is still very poisonous. I am currently seeing a psychologist as I would like to heal. My biggest fear is becoming someone like my mother and inflicting pain on my family like she did. I am petrified of becoming her. anyway, today I was at a friends house They repeated a story that I apparently told them when we were in high school and It was a lie.. a complete lie. I am sitting here now remembering some of the things I told people - I used to be a compulsive liar.. like, out of this world made up stories. I am so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. I couldn't even cough up the truth when they said it.. It has really depressed me as I am not sure why I felt the need to do this when I was younger. My life was dramatic enough lol. Although, I'm not sure anyone was very aware of what was going on in my house as my mother is ""quite the woman"" in this small town - I do not understand where on earth I could of even thought these stories up.

PTSD-1827,(TRIGGER WARNING -firearms related) A new flashback after a very long time,"Dear All~ This post involves putting down animals - please no not read if you think it might upset you. I'm writing this account in part to because I feel I need to in order to fully accept it, partly so others with PTSD can see what can happen in the future - and perhaps take encouragement. Flashbacks that were much closer in time to the original event were for me overwhelming in many ways. This is a new one, not experienced before and milder. The subject matter may seem silly or trivial to some. My wife is in the next room. I used to be a policeman. These events happen around 1980 and whilst I have been able to refer to them in conversation it has always been in a clinical fashion. In the last couple of weeks they have suddenly become 'real' with several occasions where I was fully back there. One of my duties was to be on-call after hours. At that time the local railway fell in my jurisdiction. On two separate occasions I was rung up by the public saying that there were injured sheep on the tracks. On each occasion I went to the area involved, wearing old clothes and located them. Some were in a very bad way, and since I had no possibility of quickly calling a vet I had to put them down. In each case they had been there some time. To do this I had to use my service revolver and stop to reload before completing the task. I then went home, showered and changed and my wife rang the railways to clear the track. This is surprisingly hard for me to say. The memory is crystal clear in my mind with sounds and other sensory input, however I will not give any more details, they are not really suitable. I'm not flashing back, so I guess I'm improving.

PTSD-1828,Mindfulness PTSD and Trauma...,"It seems to be a bit of a thing. I have been hearing people say that they can't do mindfulness strategies because they don't want to think about the past. I was thinking though for me mindfulness is about being fully in the moment right now. It was my pathway out of the PTSD symptoms because they stopped my awareness of the world around. I think of it as reclaiming the now. There seem to be enough front line workers and former ones here who are carrying stories, moments, sounds, and all sorts. I am another of that group. I do wonder what I would be like if I had been a plumber or a florist instead. Even so, with a little perseverance I am able to be in some of those places and around some of those people and feel alright, it took 5 years, and there will be more no doubt.

PTSD-1829,I just need to get things off my chest (trigger warning: sexual abuse),"Hi, I feel terrible for venting/dumping my issues on strangers when the reason i don't want to talk to family is because of how much it depresses people them hearing it, i'm hoping strangers won't have a vested interest in me to become depressed over my pathetic problems. I've been crying for the past 2 hours following an anxiety bout, i haven't slept for about 39 hours and i am no where near to being able to close my eyes let alone sleep. My brain hates me right now. The man i'm in love with is asleep next to me and i don't want to wake him up and speak to him because he has his own problems and i'm over dumping my stuff on him and making it worse for him. I'm not speaking to my father (we moved back in with m parents after my mum had a hip replacements and my older brother decided he couldn't help) because he has spent the past 8 months criticising every decision i make, every aspect my my personality and every choice i have made or plan to make. My mum has just started seeing a psycologist and been diagnosed with BPD (which i was diagnosed with about 7 years ago), so she's wrapped up in her problems and when i try to talk to her she changes the topic to her problems or she shuts down and doesn't know what to say. My older brother decided he didn't have to have anything to do with the family when he moved out and got a girlfriend and he has had issues with me since i had a severe suicidal period and nearly let my dog starve along with me. I just don't know what to do, i can't get hopeful about anything (I've given up on being happy). There is only the man i love who accepts my decisions and who i changed into after getting counselling (i started standing up for myself) but like i said he has his own problems and it kills me thinking i'm making him depressed by constantly crying on his shoulder. I'm 28 and unemployed because of my mental state, i was living in a van with my dog and this man for years before coming back her and it was great. Being away from all but 1 human and only surrounding myself with nature and animals was the best i have felt in my life, but having come back to my parents house things have just gone from bad to worse. I'm living in the house that i was sexually abused in for 10 years by my older brother (he died from an illness and was 5 years older than me), he raped me from the age of 6 to 15 and it stopped only when i was too old for him.

PTSD-1830,In A Very Dark Place Right Now,"No idea how to squeeze this all into 2500 characters. We grew up with an abusive alcoholic father. My diagnoses include PTSD, severe depression, severe anxiety, Asperger's, panic disorder, sensory processing disorder, bipolar disorder (type 3), and a bunch of other stuff. Basically, I haven't been able to cope with the real world for a really long time. Almost every time I have contact with my parents, I spiral into a deep depression. DEEP. And it's always triggered by something very small. The last time I was triggered was in August last year and I haven't recovered. And now it's worse. My little sister was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in October last year, which is spreading, on top of the other massive health issues she's been dealing with all her life. She has four boys, all have the same father, and three of them are the product of partner rape. She is not 'with' him anymore, but at the moment he lives with her because she can't take care of the kids by herself. And now he wants sex. She says she's not going to let it happen. I'm worried given his behaviour in the past, and now that she's weaker than ever. Full back-story on all this stuff would take thousands of words, so to put it as simply as I can: Dad triggered me badly last year, my little sister is dying and living with a monster, she has four boys who will soon lose their mum and be stuck with their dreadful father, I am barely able to cope with my own children (who have mental health issues of their own) so there's no possibility of us taking in her kids after she passes, and for the second time in six months I am . . . I don't even know. I have no control over my emotions, I have to pull over when I'm driving to scream (literally scream), and I can say with almost 100% certainty that if I lived closer to my parents and sister I would have already been arrested for murder - of my father last year, or of my sister's ex this past Friday. I'm on medication, and I'm seeing a psychologist at the moment, and we were making some progress but what happened on Friday has set me waaaaaaaay back. I don't know how many times I can come back from this stuff, and it's only going to get worse. When my sister passes, I will lose it. Guaranteed. I don't even know what I'm asking of you guys here.

PTSD-1831,When is enough too much,"My relationship of 16 years has come to an ugly end. Weve tried so hard for the last year to fix it. I suffer from chronic depression ptsd and anxiety for about 10 years, maybe more. All as a result of this violent relationship. And ive done it alone and mostly quietly untill it hospitalised me 2 years ago. I could not burden my family and I had his shit as my destraction. Im not a drama queen and like my vulnerabilities as my own. I don't play the victim because I stayed by choice and loved him. My relationship was a tumultuous one and the anger he has had all his life has left its stain on me. Im 45 have 2 grown kids and a granddaughter and one on the way I buried the son that wasnt mine by birth two years ago. My depression is so severe that those 3 and my mum are all that holds me to the earth. While I have a genuine fear of ""killing myself"" I fear im doing exactly that. Im self destructing in the slowest ugliest way. I weigh 39kgs at 5""10 not taking my meds that treat a few vital organs. I smoke two packs a day and eat nothing while working 12 hour labour shifts. I dont drink or drug. cant be bothered showering or brushing my teeth. Im losing work because I cant control the crying. I feel sick all the time and just so obscenely sad. Its more than the breakdown of my relationship its a breakdown. Period. Ive been through these before but ive never had a depressive episode last 3 months. I am barely sleeping and three times in the last month ive had to look at the mail on the table to remember my own name!. Sometimes im so confused I walk to work because I cant figure out the peddles and gears. I forget the simplest tasks at work and its getting noticed. I've fears and insecurities that make me feel so worthless. And for the first time ever I dont know how to deal. Im not even sure why I am here telling this. Though I have suffered so much physical abuse and emotional torture for so many years it has never crossed my mind to abandon him in his torment, maybe I understood on a different level that alot of society is not willing to accept. His sadness had nothing to do with me so itried to help. His physical state is as bad as mine and he doesnt drink or drug either. I dont want to abandon him but I dont really want to die either.

PTSD-1832,PTSD Cyclist vs Car,"I just joined up to this site last week, almost 3 years ago I was riding my bike to work when a driver of a car failed to give way at a round about and hit me off my bike breaking my left femur. I had a spiral fracture that split my bone into 3 and required surgery and a metal rod and 4 screws to hold it all back together. like you also I have had ongoing chronic pain ever since, I have since had 2 more surgeries to remove all the metal but still the pain persists nearly 3 years on and is now having a bad effect on my hips and knee joints on both legs. I tried to return to my work as a spray painter 6 months after the accident even on light duties but still couldn't manage to keep up with demand, I stuck it out for a year and a bit trying all sorts of different solutions to help deal with the pain none of which had much effect. I have now since left my job last year to try and seek more suitable employment. but all I have known since leaving school is spray painting, so it is proving rather difficult to find anything else. I have had many interviews for jobs that my skills would b transferable but it seems no one wants to hire a broken person. Needless to say this has also had an effect on my mental health, I had a bit of a meltdown just before the first year past becoming serverly depressed and anxious. I have been seeing a psychiatrist ever since and have been put on some fairly heavy anti depressants. Even with all that I still find it hard to get better when there is still all this pain and money worrys. I have a claim underway aswell which also stresses me out and it just keeps getting pushed back further by the doctors who say I'm not stable yet. I'm only 28 but this whole experience has just drained the life out of me not to mention physically I now move like a 70 year old, I've forgotten what its like to be normal. Is there any one else in a or has been through a similar situation and feel like sharing?

PTSD-1833,Secondhand trauma (help for 16yo),"Hi everyone! I'm 16 and am trying to just get my mental health in better shape: so a little background. When I was a few months old my mother lived with my father (who was an alcoholic/drug addict/emotionally abusive etc.) and the relationship ended pretty quickly. He was diagnosed with manipulative traits + threatened to kill her one night and disappear with me. She left pretty quickly and I have no memory of him at all (I grew up with mum and my step dad . His mother/father I was in contact with for a long time until I learnt more about how terrible his father was as well so we lost contact. I""m still best friends with his mother though (who has divorced her husband). A few years ago however I learnt that my father had threatened to kill my mother, that his father was physically violent to his children, that people had accused him of sexual assault + he slapped me across the face when I was a baby - and some more stuff. All this information had a deeper impact than I thought it would, I thought it wouldn't affect me too much but it completely consumed me. I felt violated, felt that I had been betrayed by both my father and grandfather and felt very unsafe. What it led to were constant nightmares where my grandfather tried to kidnap me, and by far the worst, a dream where my father had both my sister and mother at knife point (I woke up thinking I was going to die). I was waking up anxious, I felt anxious when talking about anything family related and was just consumed by this knowledge and info about my father. While I havent had a nightmare for 6 months now, I am still consumed by my father and get very anxious very quickly when asked to talk about family (hands shake, heart beats) etc. Ive never really spoken to anyone about this but upon reading about PTSD a few weeks ago, it hit me that that's what it could have been - but then, I don't remember the trauma? Can PTSD stem from hearing about the trauma you were a part of even if you can't remember it?

I have reached a point...or maybe the point has reached me...where I am not capable of giving it anywhere near what used to be my best shot....but for now its the best I can do. I really don't know if that will be enough. That's why I'm here. I need support. And I will give that too...as much as I am capable of giving. It will never be as much as I used to. But one needs to reserve love and energy for oneself and not deplete it to their own detriment...as I have in the past.

PTSD-1835,Ready To Do My Charlie!,"Bad news from my family interstate yesterday. Miles away from my family worried about them & feeling helpless, stressed. Then at work, I am stuck in a toxic, unhealthy & unprofessional place- where today my boss totally undermined me in front of the child I sent inside for hurting another child. Totally disrespected me because she wanted to kiss butt & not give a stuff about her staff. Leaving me feeling like worthless poo! No chance of the kids listening to me at work now, when the boss undermines my authority. But it's ok for her staff to be verbally abused & some have also been physically assaulted by children. Now it's almost 2:30am & I can't sleep because the noisy, inconsiderate neighbours seem to think it's ok to play loud music at this hour & don't need to use their inside voices. Its alomost every night & ive had enough! I am so fed up with living in a superficial, fickle, self absorbed & self entitled world, where no one has life skills, social skills or even manners. SERIOUSLY how flipping hard is it to show consideration, common courtesy & respect to humanity!! Just to be aware of others around you! GRRRRR!!!!! It makes me so angry & sad. It makes me feel like an alien from different planet. planet manners or planet respect perhaps! I ready to lose my Charlie! And then I'm angry that I'm angry coz that's not the real me & a total waste of energy! Arrrgh so stressed! So over this world- give me a Labrador dog any day! It's really not that hard to be kind, treat people with respect & yet it can make the world of difference to someone's life! Beam me up!!! Ok end of rant. Thanks.

PTSD-1840,Anxiety or PTSD?? (trigger warning: domestic and sexual abuse),"Hi I am a newby so please bare with me..... I have lived with anxiety for a very long time (30+ years). I was indecently assaulted when I was around 3 years old for approx 2 years. I didnt tell anyone about this for fear I would get into trouble (told by abuser that if I told I would get into big trouble by my mum). So I carried this secret until I was in my 40's. I told my mother then and she was shocked and upset. Funnily, I did not blame anyone for this..... I just put it out of my mind for all that time. I didnt dwell on it. I met my partner when I was 18 and everything was wonderful then the abuse started. MaInly if he had been drinking. Physical abuse.... The usual back hander, thumped on the head, pushed, black eye, split lip. Then of course next day he was sorry and be the most wonderful man on earth filling my heart with love. At age 23 I was pregnant, we got married and the abuse was still happening. One night when I was 8 months pregnant, he came home drunk, we had an argument, he oushed me over and then kicked me in stomach. Next day he was sorry etc etc.... We ended up having two children. Abuse continued. This went on for aporox 10 years. He had even threatened me with ""if you try to leave me you wont get out alive""...... I was very afraid so I stayed. All this abuse was alcohol fuelled. The short story is I have stayed with this man for 36 years. Whilst he is not physically violent now, everytime he drinks alcohol I feel myself getting very stressed and aggrevated. I have spoken to him about this but he says its my problem not his and if he has to stop having ""a couple of beers after work, he will stop working"". I dont know if I have developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or if its anxiety. He is very selfish in he will not own the fact that he did abuse me..... He always says ""if I hit you you would never have got up"".... (He was amatur boxer when he was young). He will not admit to the way he treated me or he just says that I deserved it. Im sorry this post is a bit all over the place - I would like your opinion if its possible for me to have PTSD?",Bellamaree,Community Member,15-02-2017,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/anxiety-or-ptsd-trigger-warning-domestic-and-sexual-abuse/td-p/268678

When I was six I was sexually assaulted by a family relative for an ongoing two years and whilst that was happening my father was abusing me for 10 years. I was told I have a photogenic memory but I can't remember the important parts of everything that happened. I told the police whatevert I could remember but that made it worse. I'm living with bullying at the moment at school and I've been absolutely kicked to the curb. I feel as there is nothing left anymore. It has been so hard writing this.

PTSD-1842,Do I really have PTSD,"Hi there I have been feeling depressed and increasingly anxious since late last year and finally sought medical help and was placed on antidepressants . In short I was subjected to intimidating and bullying behaviour (including swearing, name calling and discrediting me) by a number of staff in my workplace for a couple of years including a male person threatening to 'take me out to the car park'. A number of these people also made disparaging public comments against me on face book. Anyway, I knew I was becoming down and stressed about their treatment toward me and needed to get away. I was successful in finding another job (albeit) temporary for 12 months. My mood and anxiety, while not going away completed, did improve significantly. The temporary job then ended and I was faced with returning to my old job (I cant afford to not work). The boss agreed to allow me a few months leave to try and find another job, however within a few weeks my depression and anxiety became so bad I needed to get medical treatment. I also started seeing a psychologist who believes I am suffering PTSD. My question is ...is it possible to have PTSD? I understood that PTSD related to experiencing a life threating situation. I also would appreciate any thoughts on whether it is unusual for medication not to be effective. I have been on my medication for a couple of months and the anxiety (at least) seems worse than ever (I have an appointment tomorrow to have my medication reviewed). Sorry if this is garbled, but any thoughts would be appreciated. lou",MoodyLou,Community Member,13-02-2017,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/do-i-really-have-ptsd/td-p/263348

PTSD-1844,How to tell my.mum about a trauma in my childhood without breaking her?,"Hi I'm TT, Straight to the point - for 10 years of my childhood until I turned 17, I grew up in a hostile and abusive household. My stepfather was terrible to us all, but quite predominately my mother was his prime victim. 2 events happened during this time that haunt my mind - even as an adult and just shy of 5 years later. On 2 seperate occasions I was abused by my stepfather, and at the time I told my mother about 1 of them and she dismissed my statement. Years later the events still trouble me and my mothers dismissal. Now that she is also in a better place mentally and no longer facing this man and not facing fear, I want to be able to be open and tell her what happened. Yet I worry that she either; a) wont believe me, b) that I will convince myself I made it up, c) she will completely shut down or d) she will explode on me. Any one of those things could happen (or others), and I dont know how to tell her. I havent told anyone about what happened, yet I figured I wanted to tell my mum. How do I tackled telling her something that will break her heart?

PTSD-1849,Road to Recovery - 28 Years of Struggle is Enough,"Hi, I'm new here. I have never shared my story in writing to anyone, but this is a first step on the road to recovery. I was sexually abused by my father from as early as I can remember until the age of 12 yrs old. I was 15 when it finally came out. My mother confronted my dad about it, and he admitted to everything. She chose to stay with my Dad and support him through community workshops etc that were available at the time. I was forced at the time to go to therapy, but it didn't last as I wasn't able to deal with it at that age, so I never did. The last 28 years have quite literally been a blur for me. At 16, the drinking began - it's never stopped. It helped dull the pain - it still helps dull the pain. As too, did the pointless relationships with all the wrong men, one after the other, after the other.... I left school and did an office administration course. Work has been the one constant in my life - the one thing that kept me functioning normally. At 20, I met my husband-to-be, again, in hindsight, the wrong man for me. Someone who could barely hold down a job, someone who was distant and was not looking for commitment, someone who treated me with disrespect because that's what I felt I was worthy of. But that suited me at the time. In January 2000, we married. I was 6 months pregnant. In April 2000, my beautiful baby boy was born. In August 2005, I had a gorgeous baby girl. Work functions, partying and a multitude of flings throughout my marriage later, I left my husband in August 2010. I still struggle with the guilt of all of my actions - it was out drinking, that I was at my happiest. My escape. I struggle to even write a lot about my nearly 40 years of life, as it is marred so significantly with shame, disappointment, regret, anger, sadness - so many mixed emotions. I have been in an on again-off again relationship now for the past 4 & a half years. Again, one where he kept me at a distance right up to about a year ago. But that suited me. It is only now, that I'm starting to feel that I want for something better. I want for all the endless guilt, anger, sadness to go away. I want to proud of me and to be able to create happiness within. I've made the decision that this is now or never. I've had opportunities presented to me that I want to take advantage of, but my negative self-worth and body image has held me back. I start therapy next week. I know it's not going to be easy, but it will be worth it.",C-marie,Community Member,09-02-2017,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/road-to-recovery-28-years-of-struggle-is-enough/td-p/256546
PTSD-1850,The thoughts that haunt,"I'll just start. I suppose some perspective is necessary here. About 6 months ago I had steady employment, it wasn't challenging, perhaps a little boring and filled with the kind of sordid banality that can only exist in modern offices. But it had routine and that is it turns out was unreasonably important. An inflection occurred in September when I was at a conference and presented some things I had been working on. I gave a presentation on phenomena I thought everyone new about, I was wrong and this turned into an offer of employment with a specialist company. No sane person turns down employment that comes to you with little effort. Especially when it's with a global specialist firm. However this work require me to travel and be away from home. This has been my utter undoing. The last 6 months have been agony. I have consistent and ever present anxiety about the upcoming work away from home. It is all consuming and requires Sisyphean mental gymnastics to keep it at bay. The fear and sadness of being away from home is totally crippling, a large portion of my day is spent controlling the fear and the overwhelming sadness. The raw mental horsepower required to maintain a semblance of function in society is unbelievable. By the end of the day, I am spent, gone. I have no energy for even the most basic tasks, it's all spent on managing the sadness and fear. Little processing power is available for anything else. To add morbid insult to injury, the anxiety sadness and fear is ever present now. Fear and crippling sadness knowing that I am going and fear and sadness when I am away. There is a component of self loathing of course. I feel like I should have had more insight into my emotional well being criteria. I had my child hood in the Balkans, right at the time when the entire Balkan region was going through a process of self immolation. A lot of the horrors I have seen will accompany my to my grave. I was Diagnosed with PTSD when I first came to Australia, but I have since managed to control it. This is possibly where the requirement for routine came in. Of course now it’s a wonderful chemical cocktail of PTSD and Anxiety and whatever else is going on in the 1,500CC of salty porridge I have residing in my skull. I am writing this maybe for posterity, maybe as an exercise in self-exorcism. An attempt to externalise the thoughts. I want to quit, I am so very tired of this self torment.

PTSD-1851,How do you explain sexual assault in marriage,"I'm new at this. Hard to find the words to describe what I'm going through at the moment but I'll try. Life has been tough for the past 7 yrs. I was diagnosed with severe carer burnout/depression when I was not coping with looking after my severely disabled son. Unfortunately he died 6 months later. After looking after him for 25 years I was lost to say the least. With the help of a great GP and a psychologist I managed. Probably wasn't the best Mum to my daughters at that time. In 2013 I separated from my husband. Just couldn't cope and wanted somone to look after me. Finally divorced in dec 2016. All through this I had a habit of scratching myself especially when stressed. Calmed down for awhile then got worse last year with stress of selling family home, divorce etc My GP wanted to know why I was still doing this. Was it something that happened in my childhood? It led me to lookback at aspects of my marriage and what I discovered wasn't pretty. Things I knew were there but didn't acknowledge because I had my son and 2 daughters to look after are now making their prescence felt. I have told my GP and psychologist and a close friend but can't bring myself to tell my family. Is this normal? My brother and sister know I've had a rough time but keep telling me to look forward not backward. Just so hard at the moment. Tempting to lock it all away, try and forget it happened. I need to work this out so if I start another relationship I can trust again. I know talking will help just feel so scared at the moment.

I spoke to my GP last week and we are in the process of finding a clinical psycologist. I have been on medication for clinical depression and anxiety about a year. I have been so numb and afraid for so long now. I am a survivor of domestic violence. I am blessed to be almost 6 months clean and sober. The violence ended in 2013 when he went to prison. I have the love and support of amazing men and women at my meetings which keep me sober and not isolated. I am 48, being sober again is like waking up to ""life"" for the first time....Where have i been? What's going on, and why is everyone in such a hurry !! I have suffered alot more in my lifetime but i have hope today that i too can and will recover. If i had a middle name, it would be ""pretend its not happening"" !! But it is. I get scared real easy, spend most if the days alone, go for gentle walks in the park, sit and meditate, laugh at the dogs and get lots of doggy hellooooz. I'm so not ready to add any socialising or groups with strangers just yet. Next door aren't home much but lately they have been fighting and i felt like i was having a nervous breakdown. When its time for bed, i hear sounds and am real jumpy and cant sleep. When i hear their car, my anxiety levels begin to rise. I know in my heart of hearts that i am safe......but i am so afraid of people. I am fatigued most of the day. Gratitude keeps me sane. I have been afraid all of my life and i don't have the energy to run anymore.....i guess it's my time now to face my demons. Does it get better? Thanks for listening peeps !

I havent been in a fight for about the same length of time And I haven't had a drink for 8 mnths, which is HUGE for me last night was the first time I was aware that I was actually having flashbacks due to PTSD. It was weird, my partner and I went to the local pub to watch Danny green vs Anthony mundine, my father is an aboriginal man and I'm not sure but mundines footwork reminded me so much of my dad, and then just all the drunk men everywhere yelling, my partner was drunk and nearly got in a fight twice and by the time I got home I felt like I was having a breakdown. i couldnt open my eyes. I didn't recognize my partners voice unless I was looking at him. I didn't feel like I was in the present, or even on this planet. I Specifically could visualize one time when I was about 5 and my dad got into a bar fight and a glass got shattered over my head, I remember crying alone in the bathroom picking glass out of my hair. But it just all felt like it had just happened or something? I couldn't stop shaking, i couldnt breathe. I was afraid to go to sleep. And once I did finally go to sleep I woke up twice during the night crying in my sleep (although this happens often) I had to keep reminding myself of the present. Of my son asleep in his bed, of my dog, my partner, our home. It worked and I would strongly suggest this mindfulness method anyone in an anxiety attack! I'm really struggling today. I still feel really traumatized. Im feeling depressed and guilty. my partner doesn't really understand, im afraid he's going to leave me. I actually thought he was going to hurt me last night. I think its affecting our relationship. I don't mean to drag on so much, I just needed to get that off my chest in a non judgmental environment.

I'm afraid having PTSD may doom me to a life alone as I don't want to subject someone to unpredictable & ever changing moods. I don't feel like a very fun person to be around anymore, even though I know I'm still very loyal, reliable, encouraging person.

PTSD-1856,For All Vietnam Vets,"I am the daughter of a Vietnam Vet! I have seen & experienced first the effects this war has had on both the Vietnam Vets & their families. I have heard the screams of my dad as he has night terrors. And suffered the damage of his domestic violence as a result of his PTSD! As a daughter I felt like the war & PTSD robbed me of ever having a dad- I lived with a stranger who could explode at any moment! Although my dad did not come home in a body bag, it always felt like he died in Vietnam! My heart breaks at the stories he tell when drunk( only time he could talk about it) and now that I have PTSD I understand the hell & torment he lived in- the darkness- trapped feeling with no peace or release! My heart breaks & goes out to all Vietnam Vets & their families! I am sorry you never got the hero welcome you deserved. I can not imagine how painful it would be to come home to your country who treated you appallingly! And who failed to see the sacrifices & suffering you went through for your country! Please forgive us for not showing the gratitude you all deserved & for our ignorance! I want to thank every Vietnam Vet for your service, sacrifice & suffering you continue to endure for your Country! I have nothing but ABSOLUTE honour, admiration & great respect for you!

PTSD-1857,PTSD I need help.,"5-6th Feb 2016 I was hospitalised 30 hours away from my home town, away from my family. I was sent to my family via DVconnect, I drove with a body so brutally bashed I felt like I'd been hit by a truck. Two fractured feet, still in crutches. (They wanted to send me on a bus but I refused as I'd have to leave my car & my dog behind). I had traveled with a fake name. He was arrested & realised on bail. I spent 5 months after moving from towns for the work but could never settle. Once I found out he had moved away, I moved back (crazy, I know). This was the only place I felt comfortable despite previous events. My PTSD is insane, & getting worse. He is sentenced on the 10th of Feb. I have vivid, horrendous nightmares that even now I could describe in detail. I live in a rural town with minimal support. I need some help, I don't even know what or how but I need it. (Our relationship was ongoing for 18months, the violence kept escalating, i had left multiple times, he was a narcissist, he could eat Corn Flakes & tell you he was eating yoghurt...)",372rodeo,Community Member,03-02-2017,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-i-need-help/td-p/230257
PTSD-1858,(Trigger Warning) Upcoming Trial is sending PTSD in overdrive,"In September 2015 I was the Victim in an Assault with an illegal weapon and Detainment case. The defendant is my Ex- partner of 9 years to whom I was at the time 12 weeks pregnant. He was arrested and placed in prison, I miscarried the baby. By Christmas he was out on bail. We have had no contact since this time. Fast forward to now he is living locally to me ( against bail conditions) with his new partner who is having his baby. The people around him believe me to be a liar despite there being enough evidence for the case to have been committed to trial ( DNA etc). Since his release My Ex-partner has taken out Credit Cards and Bank Accounts in my name, the police could not prove it was him. Since the assault happened I have done everything I can to try to move on with my life, I have completed two courses and am currently completing another. In spite of all this, the trial is coming up this year and I find myself suffering panic attacks and depression similar to those I suffered in the weeks after the Assault. I feel like a complete failure while he is living happily with his new partner and child.

PTSD-1859,Hope for warriors with PTSD,"Hello Everyone I'm 24 years of age, I'm a manager at a telco, I love to read and write fantasy books, and I have Bipolar type 1, OCD and PTSD. Rewind back 8 years ago and uttering that last sentence would be horrific. I feel no shame anymore. Its hard, and life altering but I always look for the silverlining. Like many people living with PTSD diagnosis is the easy part, treating it and facing it is the hard part. To cut a very long and gruesome story short, my Mum is diagnosed Bipolar Type 1 (wonder where I get it from haha) she suffered a lot of domestic abuse and left my Dad (aka the catalyst) when I was 5 years old, I don't blame her for that, if she'd stayed she would of comitted suicide, she had her own long journey to follow, and she's now my greatest friend. My dad is a controlling, manipulative and abusive man. My whole life was emotional and mental abuse, his goal to isolate and dominate. My first panic attacks started to happen when most kids go to their first slumber party. I cleaned and cooked as soon as I could reach the benchtop (inclusive of a little red chair to stand upon). The house was covered in plastic, plastic couch (that we couldn't even sit on) plastic walk ways so we couldn't touch the carpet, one wrong step and all hell would break loose. But I loved him, he was all we had, for better or for worse. And each day it got worse. When I was 15 my brother left for the Navy and the sexual assault started.It went like that for 2 years, each time after I fought back he'd make me apologise for making him feel like a pedophile, so I stopped fighting, it felt better then having to apologise. I went to to get diagnosed when I was 20, I no longer wanted to be a victim, I wanted to be a hero. So I fought, through mania and depression and med side effects, I was doing better. I would never be cured but I could handle it, I had handled worse. PTSD started at age 22, it'd been years since he'd touched me (he'd gotten remarried) I lived out of home with my boyfriend, I thought I was safe. But the nightmares and flashbacks came anyway. So I fought, I confronted my Dad and I tried to reassemble my life again and I have, it's still a battle day every day but its worth it, I get to see my boyfriends loving smile, my brother engaged with two beautiful kids of his own, lifes worth it.

PTSD-1860,"Stressful times with PTSD, Isolation, Chronic Illness, Domestic Violence, Harassment","Hello there, I have found myself in an challenging and uncomfortable position. I was diagnosed years ago with chronic fatigue, social anxiety, panic disorder and reoccurring PTSD (from childhood). I have always been able to fight on through the downtimes with a smile on my face. After various tremulousness years, dealing with domestic violence from my former long term partner and him being a lead social activist for political causes has caused me to further isolate and feel ostracized from the community. I was getting on my feet again, and it all tumbled down before me when I lost my job, became harassed and stalked online and in person by a love obsessed acquaintance (I had previously helped through hardships), and the new man I was dating becoming involved in an hit and run suffering months in a coma resulting in traumatic brain injuries and a vegetative state. During this time I had no support or any means to speak too anyone about this as the stalking I was dealing with limited my access for help, and thus overtime enhancing the feelings of separation. I applied for centrelink disability services and was rejected on the grounds my conditions are not stablized though have been told I have a reduced capacity to work. Now my situation is that place in which I am living is being sold, I have been renting in for a time. The stress with finding a new place to move, on top of working out how to seek help for my other issues is causing problems. For today they are holding an open house and I cannot move due too chronic fatigue flair up, last time they held one I pushed my body in making sure I had everything organized and leaving the house (which was huge for me) and spent days after recovering. I have been trying to reach out to see a therapist who can initially do skype sessions and work my way into face to face, improving my diet and finding new group of friends whom share common interests and have no connection to my ex. I thought to write here as a means to voice what has been happening and seek validation and support also, as I have been scrolled through people's stories and felt that compassion. My goal is to be able too recover as best to my ability and to be able to do the things I have missed for so long.

PTSD-1864,Scared to be me my husband is verbally abusive,"How do I find me again, my husband and I have been together for 7 years and it's never been easy. It wasn't until a year in that I realised he had a drinking problem. He drinks five or six days a week. It's something he says he wants to change but all he does is become more secretive about alcohol. He verbally abuses me for hours when he's had too much or if he hasn't had enough. He stores a head full of things and puts me down and speaks to me like crap. I'm believing everything he has said about me now and I don't know what to do. I'm not perfect but I was comfortable with myself before we met, he's not an attentive husband or father he tries really hard when he's feeling guilty then uses that against me. My five year old now asks him to not yell at mum and if he's having more drinks, I think I should have left already but I love the focused him. I now have no one , I have cut myself off from the world and feel useless he criticises the way I am around his friends and tells me I f@&$)d up my kids. Always personal, I can't take anymore but I don't know if I can rise above and move on. Or am I more to blame than I realise. This is my second Marriage he keeps reminding me of that. He says there is no such thing as abuse because he has never laid a hand on me. Although he has threatened to break every bone in my body. I kicked a bedroom door down in panic one night during an argument as he was holding my one year old and screaming at me and he locked himself in the room with him, I just wanted my baby back. He uses that against me now all the time.

PTSD-1866,"(Trigger warning: sexual abuse) Full of anger, confusion and depression - and I am not the one having to deal with the real problems","I am angry! Angry at my partner's parents for being so hopeless and compounding the problems that my beautiful partner, S, is facing up to and dealing with. S had a horrible childhood at the hands of her brother who bullied, physically assaulted, intimidated and generally made her life hell from the age of 9. Her parents also bore witness to his wrath and were themselves assaulted and threatened with violence - even a knife. The police were called to their house on 5 occasions, by their neighbours, during his explosive 'episodes', (never by them though as the Mother would not allow such a thing to be done -BTW she is a psychiatrist wet dream with compound issues of delusional behaviour, egotism, eating disorders, etc. and has caused her own level of trauma to S through her self-serving emotional bullying- and yes S's mother was abused as a child too). Over the past 2 years S's emotional state has deteriorated. Despite a very comfortable lifestyle with everything one could want S has been wrestling with her past and the repressed monster inside of her finally broke out. Fortunately we got to a safe place so S could seek treatment. It transpires that S was also sexually abused on several occasions by her brother - commencing at the age of 9. She didn't tell her parents at the time and they now show no interest in hearing what she has/needs to say or facing up to the reality of what happened. S has been admitted to the clinic twice and I fear she will need to go back again soon as I simply can't keep her safe from herself. I have tried to tell her parents that she needs them to hear her and what she has to say. There is simply no way that they couldn't have put 2 and 2 together and worked out that their son raped their daughter! She has told them that her brother, physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually abused her and that is why she is going into hospital for treatment but their response is 'it happened in the past - there is no benefit to reliving it all -you need to get over it!' She is being so brave to face up to her past and work through it - and I know she can be successful - but the additional layer of her parents dismissing it, not supporting her and worse still not wanting to believe her, might be more than she can manage. I am doing everything I can to support. I am scared for her and I am so angry at her parents - I want to blurt it all out to them but know it is not my place to do so. I just want what's best for S.",Sir_Duke,Community Member,11-01-2017,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trigger-warning-sexual-abuse-full-of-anger-confusion-and/td-p/268728

I ran in slow motion to his side and tried in vain to help. I told him he would be alright and help was on the way. He cried. My mind leapt back to reality and realised he was not returning to this world. I shuddered and felt the guilt for not recognising his plan.

PTSD-1870,Traumatic Experience as a child,"Hi there, Was wondering if anyone can help bring a bit of clarity here? Am I normal? I am 32 years old. I've never really received any professional help just the help of close family & friends. I feel I am a bit different from most people and struggle sometimes. I find that I get really annoyed & irritated at the smallest things a lot of the time and I can be quite a negative person and I feel its starting to effect my life and take over a bit. My husband doesn't really get it but he accepts me and is very patient. We as a family went through quite a traumatic experience. I was 13 years old and grew up in South Africa when the indecent happened. One Friday night we were all at home my mum, myself & 2 sisters. Dad was at the pub having a few drinks. Between leaving the pub and driving back home he was attacked and stabbed in his neck. He drove home parked the car walked up to the house and passed out on our front doorsteps. We opened the door and found him there still alive. We called the ambulance service and it took them just under 2 hours to arrive. In that time my mum was running around like a headless chicken. My oldest sister was the one who kept dad alive doing CPR and apply pressure to his wound until the ambulance eventually arrived. I even remember dad taking his last breath on my sisters lap. She gave him CPR and he came back. Anyways the ambulance arrived eventually my mom got in with dad and left for the hospital must have been around 12-1am. At about 4-5am my mum came alone home sat down in the lounge and told us dad had died. I do remember feeling very angry weeks after it happened. I was very close to my father. A few years later going into teenage years I starting smoking drinking & Drugs and dropped out of school and got involved with the wrong crowd and landed up in jail over night for the first time. (my father was a police officer lol he wouldn't be very proud of that) Anyways after being arrested for a night I woke up and came to my senses very quickly. I still smoke & have the odd glass of wine or 5 but no more drugs anymore since 20 years old. I've never been to get any professional help. But I find I get really, annoyed, angry & frustrated and very small insignificant things. I also find it takes me forever to make friends as people annoy me. I do feel like im very different to everyone else and being around people who small talk really does my head in. Is this normal?

PTSD-1871,Anxiety from being stalked,"Hi all, Over the past 11 months I have been the victim of stalking, intimidation and harassment. I have been followed, stared at constantly, cut off while walking along the footpath, and had my stalker trying to find out information about me through friends. I recently started counselling through my university but now that holidays are here there is no one I can talk to and I feel like my anxiety is getting worse. I have spoken to the police several times, but as most of this is occurring in public places, there is no trace of any evidence and the only option is an AVO. I am quite scared to go ahead with this as I do not want consequences – our children go to the same school and unfortunately changing is not an option. I failed an exam for uni earlier this year as I had been followed the evening before and I just couldn’t think straight. Just recently I went to our local library to study for upcoming exams and he followed me there too. I haven’t received my results yet, but there is a chance that I have failed a whole subject. I am devastated as I had really good grades up until six months ago. Since that happened I have been feeling so much anxiety. I get into bed at night and I can feel my heart pounding, I can’t sleep and it makes it so hard to get out of bed the next day. My head feels foggy, I can’t concentrate, and I am scared for my daughter. He has been asked to leave me alone, yet he continues. I am so angry, frustrated and upset about this and I just don’t know how to cope with the anxiety anymore. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Birthdays haunt me, i used to love occasions but now their a burden, i can't handle the cake part. It's just constant reminders. Now that my birthday is once again approaching those feelings are getting worse, my friends insist on throwing me a party but what if that's just out of pitty? It's lovely of them but i can't help thinking that. I still keep the meds locked in a box I'm that paranoid. I hate birthdays. Yet i used to love them.

PTSD-1874,Horrible dream triggering anxiety & bad feeling about myself,As background information I was diagnosed with PTSD related to being caught in a bushfire a child. Most of the time I am fine but find hot weather particularly if the fire danger is high I struggle. For the last week it has been hot and now my husband who I care for is sick. I am currently on some medication for a physical health issue which is making me feel blah! On top of that I am tired from lack of sleep due to heat & some health issues. Last night was very hot (although fire danger wasn't severe) & my husband was coughing & sounding very ill. This led to a very broken sleep. At one point I had a horrible dream about a bushfire where I couldn't think straight enough to organise myself so I could leave before too late. I found when I woke up I was still half in the dream & spent the rest of the night worrying about how useless I was. When I got up I was still breathing fast & feeling very shakey due to the anxiety & bad feelings brought on by the dream. I know it was a dream but that didn't stop it triggering the negative beliefs about myself caused by the original fire. Thoughts include feeling guilty & useless because I didn't do anything to help as a child with the dream reinforcing the fact that I still can't deal with situations where I need to act as a competent adult to prevent harm to myself or others. This then morphs into feeling useless anyway. I feel like when it is hot my life is put on hold. I'm unable to do anything useful and I can't do anything enjoyable. Summer stretches in front like a prison sentence.

PTSD-1875,Just had enough of this,"Hi there Im new and not sure really what's driving me to write something on here. I've been suffering with PTS for about 13 years and my issues are all pretty much relate to Defence service and overseas deployments etc. I've come to a point where managing my avoidance, anxiety, nightmares, temper, over reactions to things are really weighing me down. Im just not coping with things and it's had a massive impact on my marriage and family. I'm not going to make excuses for myself, but I can't control myself and the way that I've become. Life has just become a struggle and Im not sure how to move things forward any more. My marriage is at breaking point, and I feel disconnected with everyone around me.

PTSD-1876,Numerous traumatic events and how to cope? Newbie.,"I'm new here and just feel like I need to 'talk'. I lost my grandmother in 2006, then my mother passed away suddenly from medical negligence in 2013. My cousin died 6 months later. I broke up with my son's father while I was pregnant. My son was born prematurely with major health issues. I didn't get the opportunity to care for him until he was 6 months old as we were in hospital. I didn't get to hold him until he was a week old. Numerous times I feared I wouldn't take him home at all. I watched him struggle to breathe, him have numerous life saving operations and procedures. I would hear monitor alarms in my sleep. While my son was in hospital, my house was broken into and the last sentimental items I had of my mother and grandmother were stolen (wedding ring, jewellery). My stepfather was diagnosed with cancer and died 2 months later last year. Thankfully I got the opportunity to see him before he died, unlike my mother. My son has ongoing therapies and hospital stays which terrify me. I have severe daily anxiety since my mother died and have had panic disorder since I was 4 years old - every day seems like a battle to be 'normal'. I feel like I am alone in the world and it's an awful feeling. I am really struggling with my mother's death, most of the time I don't acknowledge that she's not here. I can look at photographs of her and it's like I'm looking at someone else. Like all of the emotion has been taken out. Disassociating I suppose. When I think of the person I was before all of this, I can't relate to that being me. I feel this underlying sadness all the time. The only shining light in my otherwise very lonely life is my son. I try to be the best mother I can to him but sometimes I feel as though I'm failing miserably. He deserves the very best and his existence makes me want to be the best person I can be. Thank you for reading if you've gotten this far. Any suggestions or ways to move forward from these things would be very much appreciated.",cai,Community Member,11-12-2016,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/numerous-traumatic-events-and-how-to-cope-newbie/td-p/190481
PTSD-1877,Unhappy and regretful,"Hi, Forgive my formatting as thoughts and memories are flooding sometimes in an unordered fashion. Some background. Lost my biological father to cancer at age 7, mother remarried soon after to (at the time) an Army soldier who had PTSD from time in Vietnam. As most may know, PTSD was a condition not fully understood until the eighties but this is still when he performed the most physical and mental domestic abuse mainly against my mother. To make matters worse my step-father has a narcissistic personality order I believe predates his Vietnam deployment. Although only anecdotal evidence leads me to this conclusion, I've had ample time to analyse someone I have not spoken for over 10 years. I really developed into a moody/angry young man. My twenties I regard as my darkest period. Was a tradesman but never held positions for too long. I think it was partly due to not enjoying the work. I do believe somewhere inside me there exists a friendly, funny and generous person but too often is suppressed by anxiety and sadness. I was friends with a fellow introverted high school student whom I spent too much time performing petty theft. Possibly a time in front of a judge put an end to that (no correctional time). Joined the Army Reserve at 18 and discharged after 18 years but all I remember is how angry and irrational I must have appeared to fellow soldiers. I have secondary-PTSD. I've had Government sponsored counseling and through that and self examination (surprisingly no alcohol or drug addiction) I believe I am better than I was. I used be easily triggered into anger and confrontation but feel I am able to control it much better. I'm now nearly 46 and I have nothing in my life to demonstrate any ""normal"" progress. I have been praised for opening a retail business 8 years ago but it doesn't feel that way. Some days are a struggle where I feel lost and the business is not very profitable due to this. I've not been in a personal relationship for over 13 years as I determined long ago it wouldn't be healthy for me and whomever I met. This is where I get the most criticism from people who care for me the most, but it is difficult to explain to others how destructive I feel I could potentially make it. I think that's enough. I must confess this has been therapeutic to write as something I did today left me rather anxious. Is it me or does anybody feel anxiety affects judgement?

PTSD-1878,Poor concentration due to PTSD,"I like to think that for the most, i have recovered from PTSD, well as much as you can recover from it (just my beliefs) but my concentration is still very very ordinary. Has anyone experienced this? How do you improve your concentration? I know Dr Google will have some answers but I would prefer to hear from people who have lived it. I think a bit has to do how much mental energy it takes to keep yourself grounded and the lower amount of mental energy the harder it is to concentrate but even when i feel pretty energised, i still can't concentrate much. Be interested to hear other peoples ideas on this. Cheers Mark.",MarkJT,Blue Voices Member,06-10-2016,PTSD and trauma,47,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/poor-concentration-due-to-ptsd/td-p/204222
PTSD-1879,Trouble getting help,"Ok so something happened about 5 years ago and like the next day i got the guts to call mental health crisis team and they got me to agree that i wouldn't self harm and to see dr next day. So i get myself to dr the next day and try mention what happened and he kind of just brushed it aside. He was like ""did you say 'no'"" and i said ""i was too drunk to say anything"" and then he was like ""oh good. do you want treatment for alcohol problem?"". So basically just useless cause i had peer pressure problem not alcohol problem. Anyways i managed to cope pretty well for a while. I was on anti depressant and anti psychotic because i had just been in hospital. But for the last 3 years since i been off meds I been really struggling and it feels a lot different/worse than depression/anxiety problems that i had issues with for more than half my life. I get all this rage at myself about everything and it's like my brain attacks me with all this self loathing and it freakin hurts and I have always had good understanding of myself and others but it is like i have had personality change and i just cant force myself to care. Which is strange because i used to care too much with all social anxiety stuff. Basically all i am is grumpy and cant concentrate and feel stupid all the time. It has gotten particularly bad the last 6 months with all this added stress and I almost daily i have mini breakdowns where i curl up on the floor or in bed for a few minutes clutching my stomach and coughing rather than breathing and getting all worked up with mental anguish. It is only for the last year that i start to think that maybe the way i been feeling for years is linked to stuff that happened 5 years ago and i keep going over stuff in my mind. So anyway I decided to research and find a new good female GP and i went to get help for long list of everything but because i always had problems talking and get anxious and shutdown and with the added not being able to get my thoughts straight thing lately all I managed was get back on meds for depression/anxiety and just general check up and blood tests. Meds have helped a little. I feel a little bit clearer and like i'm coping slightly better but I'm still in hell and obviously need more help. Also i having real trouble getting past that i am just overreacting and all is my fault and i am just a crazy idiot. dr also said i have vit D deficiency so maybe that makes your brain messed up or more likely i just messed myself up with all self medicating",llemonade,Community Member,12-12-2016,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trouble-getting-help/td-p/193588
PTSD-1880,I was robbed whilst I was home,"Last week I was woken up at 5.40am to a loud what I thought was knocking on the door, I got up and checked the door and nobody was there, I got my dog and returned to bed, my dog soon jumped from my bed and ran into the yard barking, I got up and looked outside, I couldn't see anything so again I got her and took her back to bed. Not even 5 minutes later my dog was on the end of my bed growling and peeking through my open bedroom door, I got up and stood at my doorway, that's when I saw a man in my living room. I started to scream and called out for my brother who quickly got up and chased the man out of the house and out of the yard. Unfortunately for weeks I had been hearing things in the yard and I'd just put it down to anxiety as my partner was in America. I am now having severe panic attacks especially at night, I lay awake and can hear every single noise, I got new locks for the doors, and am now OCD with them being locked and triple checking them. I'm to afraid of getting up in the dark, or even getting up early for work.

PTSD-1881,"Undiagnosed PTSD, Diagnosed BP2","I am about to condense my adult lifetime of illness into a few key areas. This year I voluntarily admitted myself into a private hospital that has a specialist psychiatric care. This came after the onset of a major depressive episode and aggravated anxiety triggered by 12 months of workplace bullying and harassment. My psychiatrist diagnosed Bipolar 2. Unfortunately, I suffered acute liver failure caused by medication given to me while in hospital. I was fortunate to receive a liver transplant, however due to a virus, I now have an ileostomy, I had to relearn to use my arms, relearn to walk, I have an open wound and it doesn't end there. How does PTSD fit into my story? From 16 to 24 yo I was in a domestic violent relationship. I am now 38 and I still dream about many of the traumatic episodes. My scars cause me to drift into a almost visual daydream of how I got them. I cannot handle arguments and yelling and I come out fighting from fear. I avoid places, a whole town nearby, in case I see the perpetrator. I develop scenarios in my mind of this person ruining my life, murdering my family in revenge. These prevent sleep and again impact my dreams. I was threatened with death to never talk about these issue. I can't shake it. These years and the trauma has infected my life. Fast forward to this year. The emergency liver transplant, my 3 month stay in ICU and a further 2 months in the ward has wiped me out. BUT I have to remain strong for my DDs and DH. My anxiety is at max levels. I have periods of depression. I am supposed to have more surgery next year and I am frightened. All the while I dream about the DV and wake up with dream a 'hangover', when the emotions are so real the impact the next day. I can't make heads or tail of life ATM. I am a survivor but I am only just holding on. I feel like I have to show that I am strong when I am crumbling inside. No wants a person who complains about there problems. Everyone has there own problems. I rarely talk about my feelings, except to a select few and I don't want wear them out. I have a new psychiatrist now. He comes with the liver transplant and my recovery is going well. He agrees with me on the anxiety and depression, not so much the BP2. We have not even discussed the DV yet. It is all incredibly complex and all I can do is withdraw.",FrankA,Community Member,03-12-2016,PTSD and trauma,11,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/undiagnosed-ptsd-diagnosed-bp2/td-p/271368

PTSD-1884,PTSD Signs after serious assault at work,"Hi all, i I was wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation and may be able to provide some advice, guidance or insight where I should go from here. About 3 months ago, I was seriously assaulted at work. I work in juvenile justice and was punched over 20 times to the head and neck area resulting in multiple injuries. I have since returned to work, but not on full operational duties and may not be able to ever return to full operational duties which may see me ultimately leave the department I work for. having previously worked in policing and ambulance, I have been exposed to multiple terrible and traumatic incident scenes before, but the ones that haunt me most now are from a vicious unprovoked attack back in August. constant reoccurring dreams and visions, unable to concentrate, unable to sleep or attempt to have a normal sleep pattern, irritable, emotions all over the place and not even been able to get out of bed at times. i am seeing a psychologist that deals with police and emergency service workers primarily that is great and work is trying to offer as much support as they can but even they are hesitant to return me to full operational duties ever again in case it happenes again or even gets worse. Where too from here? I love my job and love the support of close family and friends but day by day it doesn't seem to be getting any better or easier. I am not prepared to go on any anti represent medications period as any thought of that would definitely end any career prospects now or in the future that I do have.

Advice on how to control or prevent triggers from happening, especially as a loving Dad","Hello BB faithful,I wasn't sure if this fell into my previous threads categories and could not find an existing one, so started afresh-apologies if this is supposed to fit somewhere else on the site or I should have placed it in my existing threads.To cut to the chase for those who have not read my previous posts; whilst on Counter Terrorism deployment my team and I were seconds away from being blown to smithereens by a diesel fuelled IED. The situation then compounded itself by our team then having to witness the bad guys executing children amongst others at point blank range, whilst laughing as they fired single shots down their lines of victims. First off I should add, all victims were bagged (black bags over their heads) the bad guys then went down the line one by one firing a single shot above each victims head and then kick them over - this was seen as hilarious fun. The bags were promptly removed and then the true executions took place back down the line finishing with the children - some I can only guess as old as 12 the rest probably younger. We, my team, agonisingly were in no position to act to save any of these victims for various reasons I cannot discuss.At the time I was a first time dad,my first deployment away from my wife and then 9 month old baby girl.

I have been an officer in the ADF for over 15 years, I am married with three beautiful young children who are my everything.I had battled depression and anxiety (and to an extent still do) shortly after returning from military deployments and at the time could not place a finger on the causes of my feelings of self worthlessness, lack of self esteem and general daily sadness. I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and through this discovery a whole can of worms opened on several other self confidence issues and fears came into light.I am still being treated on AD but still experience bad days. To complicate and compound things more for me I am 40 years old and am just starting recovery for my second total hip replacement.My first was done 8 months ago.I have a lot on my plate and with a young family prioritising which area to focus on first is difficult as unfortunately they all feel as though one effects the other.After several years of trying to be a man and block it all away, I finally broke down and opened up and spoke in depth with my wife.Several reasons preventedd me from doing this earlier, (the PTSD issue) mainly the national security and secrecy act, but the fear of discussing my depression and anxiety with her were mainly from a fear of not being strong enough as a man or being inadequate in many ways.I still get PTSD triggers on a daily basis and as a rely I'm way over protective with my kids along with a lengthy list of other self negativity.The strong fear of not being man enough to cope with this stuff has severley effected my self confidence and I contantly feel inadequate as a man, husband and father.The fact I have 2 new shiny hips hasn't helped me in this department either.As a people pleaser in general, I am anxious that I am not good enough for my wife and that I am no longer seen as sexually attractive, strong (both physically and mentally) and fail to compare in any shape or form to her previous relationships. She remained in contact with some of her previous partners, which I have since explained hurts me, and she has promised to cease all contact.I can function sexually but she seems uninterested in any intamacy anymore. This just feeds my fears of inadequacy and self worthlessness. Just wanted to vent, looks like I have overshot my characters left... Thanks for listening, I might try and do this again soon.

PTSD-1892,Recovery Frustration,"I have had PTSD since being assaulted by me ex a few months ago and am so frustrated by how easily triggers have pulled me back for the 4th time now. The frustration with dealing with police, trying to get into counselling, doing what I have needed to to move on and then BOOM a trigger knocks me back down again. I finish up at my job next week - I just can't work anymore. My workmates have not been supportive and in fact retriggered this current spell. I am so hurt by them - and withholding anger that he gets away with doing this to me (have just found he denied assault and due to lack of evidence will not be charged). I live in a community where I feel outnumbered by his associates - he is a well respected member of the community - and I feel like he is winning. All I can really do is go back to doctor for more medication and wait until I can finally get into counselling. I can barely function - I just want to hide from the world - this sucks.",lavendar,Community Member,15-11-2016,PTSD and trauma,7,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/recovery-frustration/td-p/210897
PTSD-1893,Partner with Depression may be emotionally/verbally abusive,"I'm seeking some help/advice regarding my unhealthy relationship. I've never posted about it before, so here it goes. I'm 23, and have a 4 y/o son. And have been in an 'on again, off again' relationship with his father for the past five years. He slept with four other women in the first three years of our dysfunctional relationship. The first while I was pregnant (I gave him another chance) the second (his ex) was three weeks after our son was born and he left us for her. A couple of months later he came back and said we could work things out. Then the third when my son was just under a year old. Then the fourth when my son was 2. He kept the fourth a secret for a year but it eventually came out. Now as that seems like a problem on its own, during this time and after (it has been two years now since he's slept with anyone else) he hasn't had much regard for my feelings and how I am dealing with all of it. He is dismissive, he doesn't support any decisions I make, he's always telling me what I'm doing wrong - telling me to rephrase myself, correcting me, telling me I have poor communication skills. He gets annoyed with me over such small things and it always feels like I am walking through a minefield. Any thought or opinion I state could potentially set off a huge argument, and then when we argue he puts the blame on me and walks off, leaving me feeling guilty for saying whatever I said. Nothing I do or our son does ever seems good enough. We could always do better. Be better. I've tried to leave him about four times this year as I have become increasingly anxious and depressed, however I always find myself giving him 'one more chance'. I sometimes think that maybe it's just his depression talking, but it's so hard not to take things personally when someone you love criticises you all the time. He isn't on medication, he doesn't want it and he won't seek professional help as he doesn't think it works. I however am seeking professional help as I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice or input would be helpful.

PTSD-1898,Rape PTSD and Friend's Reactions to Rape- Advice Needed!,"So three years ago I was raped orally and anally at a party. At the time I was very concerned about my reputation and didn't tell anyone, though it hurt so much and I was very distraught. I even came close to killing myself a week after, but a girl in my class called Kelly who barely knew me sent me an anonymous letter praising me, and it saved my life. This year, I couldn't take the pain anymore and I finally felt comfortable telling people- a therapist, my parents, and my lovely friends. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and hyper vigilance. Most of my friends have been beyond brilliant, I mean none of them really understand at all, but they're trying to be there. Except Kelly. She and I are now best friends, well we have been, but after I told her she completely ignored me for weeks on end. I'm currently in Year 12 and we had been planning a schoolies trip together, to which I was uninvited after telling her what happened, and another girl asked in my place. Later when I texted her asking what happened, very upset, she replied for a bit and then blocked my phone number, not telling me. Our exams are happening right now and she says she can't talk to me until they are over, but she's still going out and drinking and having breakfast and watching concerts with my other friends, so it hurts that she doesn't have time for me. I sent her a facebook message yesterday begging her to talk to me at school today, and she said she didn't want to. It's so confusing- how could she just block me out of her life, literally? And not explain why until weeks after the fact? Is she a friend worth fighting for, because I have been, so incredibly hard? It hurts knowing when she knew nothing about my situation, she was there, but now she does and can't cope to even receive texts from me. What do I do? Do I fight for this friendship? Are exams a good enough excuse to ignore me without any explanation?

PTSD-1899,"Highly Sensative Person - Worthless, sad and alone.","I am hurting badly. I've had a crap year. I have always been a highly sensitive person, I remember as a child crying a lot. I remember other kids in the school yard saying to me 'why do you always cry', I didn't know the answer. 60kgs at the age of 8, I didn't understand that was bad or not normal. I didn't buy the food, I didn't cook for myself ... How does an 8 yr old weight 60kg!?! It has lead to a life of morbid obesity. I remember things (just a few) from my childhood that I wish I didn't ... yet they are just fuzzy enough for me to be filled with self doubt that they happened. This makes me feel usless as well. I feel worthless. I feel like most of the people who are in my life must also feel that I am worthless. Though not isolated to this but it was recently my 40th birthday and the worthlessness ive always felt but never acknowledged until this year, was reenforced by almost all of the people in my life I would have otherwise expected to want to make sure I had a special day, That being said, there were a few angles who I think may have literally saved my life (namely my 6yr old while I adore but am fearful or not doing the best thing for him constantly... My brother who came from WA to NSW to surprise me and the ladies from my work who have witnessed my breakdown this year)... But my husband (who in the last few weeks I've come to realise is messed up as me) my so called best friends, my parents - none of them made any effort to ensure I felt special and valued and I can't get past it. my whole life until earlier this year, I've gotten by telling myself I'm special and I am amazing and I'm a good person and friend and I do good things etc ... But I have nothing left in the tank and I feel like no one else can be bothered and im not worth the effort. I wasn't cared for and protected the way I should have been when I was a kid. That's why I've made horrible choices and surrounded myself with people who don't value me ... I feel maybe there's nothing to value. I write this and then want to delete it A I don't even feel I'm worthy of posting here but I am desperate and I have to try to help myself because no one else is going to do it (nor should they).

I find it hard to do daily tasks including getting out of bed and other basic things like showering or engaging with anybody. I feel like its all too much at the moment and I've really had enough of feeling the way i do. Reaching out to others to maybe hear it does get better and it does pass. Each persons journey is unique i understand but interested in hearing other stories. Im nervous about the future. I don't know what to do.

Engaged with my psychiatrist and was hospitalised for 2 weeks. was taking anti-depressants for 2 years prior and whilst in hospital was prescribed medication and another anti-depressants along with medication for sleep and anxiety. I was off work for 5 months and attempted to return to work but my anxiety and PTSD made sure i failed so im off work again. I have practised mindfulness and constantly see my psychiatrist, psychologist and GP. Do behavioural therapy, read literature, even tried going to the gym for a couple of months.

PTSD-1901,Saying what is on my mind (Trigger warning: sexual abuse),"I was sexually abused when I was a child by a step retaliative (my grandmothers parter). I had a difficult time through my teenage and early adult years. I am now 32 and had since found a certain amount of acceptance. I disclosed the abuse to family when I was 15 where I was told if my grandma left him he would go overseas and I would never be able to prosecute. At the time I thought I would eventually go to the police, but as time passed I didn't ever have the courage to do that, I told my grandmother how I felt but for some reason she continued to stay with him. When I was about 21 I decided that I couldn't continue to see my grandmother if she continued to live with him. My immediate family also cut off contact with her at this time too. So I spent many years wondering if I would ever see my grandma again. Last year I did found out that he died, and so, I spent about 6 months thinking of making time to see her again but deciding to put it off. About 3 months ago I decided to go and see her as I was worried that if I didn't do it soon then I might not ever see her. I have been very conflicted about this, one part of me is really happy to have her back in my life and the other part is extremely angry and confused regarding her choice to stay with him. When I do speak to her she sounds truely happy to hear from me but will sometimes brings him up casually, she has early dementia so I am not sure she realises how uncomfortable that would make me feel. It I know that she loves me dearly, which make it so hard for me to understand why she stayed with him and how she could have maintained any kind of relationship with him. Anyway, my brother recently split with his wife and for some reason memories from the abuse that I usually have have been feeling allot more distressing. I also had an experience where I saw someone on Monday who looked like him and it made me feel very uncomfortable.",Matala,Community Member,26-10-2016,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/saying-what-is-on-my-mind-trigger-warning-sexual-abuse/td-p/263208
PTSD-1902,Admitting it might  be bad,"I always thought that trauma was sort of the norm. Not everything good happens all of the time. Everyone has at least one or two ghosts in the closet. But the more I used to tell people about my past, the more horrified and shocked they would get. I have sort of started to come to terms with the fact that my life has been the titanic. It serves as a lesson to others. I was sexually abused by a friends father of a close relative, none of my family or friends have ever known. It went on for a while, and I only began to realize how horrific it was when i was in my early twenties. I burned down my house (accidentally, left some candles on) when I was 16. I was rejected by my mother and my father for their new families. I'm bisexual, wiccan, and while I've always had a roof over my head and food in my belly, I hit a lot of rough patches I've had bible thrown at me ""thou shalf not suffer a witch to live"". I'm in and out of depression and self-loathing my whole life, I think the first time I came out of a cycle was when I was 11, I'd been in a constant darkness all through primary school. I'm an academic, highly intellectual person and I've always, always been overweight. Struggling with weight implies there is a battle. I have never picked up the torch to get rid of it for longer than a week. - School was never easy for me, because of the other students.I thought suicidal thoughts were just the norm. I knew most of my friends contemplated it intellectually, sometimes on a struggling level, but I was in college when I began to work out that I was in deeper than most people.I feel like at any given time, there is three versions of me inside my own head; the happy, fun loving smart gal, the depressed, hateful wrathful angry girl and this survivalist utalitarian, the girl who has dragged the other two through all of this. I think to survive, I've learned to compartmentalise everything. I don't deal with issues; I just thrust them down as far into the bin of baggage, and I try to just keep going. It used to work... now, I'm 28; and I am coming undone. Last year the first time in my life I saw a psychologist. Asking for help was for people withreal, serious issues. not little stuff like my parents not loving me or some rough childhood memories. For the first time in my life, things are stable, good, even. And I cannot handle it. I am falling into anxiety bad-habits and all that baggage is almost constantly resurfacing.

PTSD-1903,Loack of childhood memories,"I have recently started to recall things from my childhood which I have never previously been able to remember. I need to be clear that I was never the victim of any physical or sexual abuse but I do believe that events in my childhood would classify as ongoing emotional abuse and it is clear to me as an adult that they have had a profound effect on my mental well being. I have acute anxiety on and off for as long as I can remember and at one point about 5 years ago did have to take medication. I guess the problem I have now is that I am beginning to recall memories from my childhood which bring to light a number of events that I had previously not been able to recall and I am getting concerned as it is starting to cause a heightened level of anxiety for me and I do not want to end up where I was previously. In some ways I am fortunate that I could try and talk through these things with my mother (which is where all of this really comes from) but I am fearful that as she has in the past she will be very dismissive of discussing things and I will be left with more questions than answers. Does anyone think it is worth exploring these things through psychology, hypnosis etc or just letting things be and trying to move past it without any assistance.

I have told my parents and friends on random one off occasions that I think I am not okay but people don't seem to respond. I feel anxiety everyday, all the time I cannot concentrate, I cannot work and I no passion, no drive no motivation to chase my dreams. I never feel good enough and I sometimes feel pain in my chest, physical pain that is from my brain..if that makes sense...it tingles down my arms and through my hands. My family and friends call it 'being lazy', 'everyone goes through this', 'it's normal'. I just cannot even function! How can this be normal! I'm lying to my family about studying at uni, I'm lying about applying fro jobs, I'm lying about everything because I feel so crap all the time that all I want to do is sleep so that I don't have to think. My father was an alcoholic and suffered from mental illness himself. My two ex boyfriends where abusive and I feel like now I am left with nothing, no confidence and no happiness. I have had 5 terminations from the ages of 18-22 and I feel that I let it keep on happening because I just did not care at all, about my body, about my future, nothing. To me looking back. It was my form of self harm. I would feel so in love with something and then I would take it away as a way of punishing myself. I wanted them every single time but my family would've disowned me. I couldn't bare the thought of hurting them anymore. I know my mind isn't healthy. I so badly want to succeed in my life and move forward but something inside is stopping me. I have put on a brave face for so long that I can't even hide it anymore. Everyone knows I'm different. They can all see it. People look at me and see someone 'beautiful', 'smart', 'funny' but they have no idea of how much it hurts to get up in the morning and show my face. I hate myself and I need help. I just don't know what to do. I saw a psychologist but she told me that this is how I will be for the rest of my life. She said I can't change it but I have to learn to deal with it. That has seriously and honestly given me zero help and has made me feel even more crap about my future prospects. All I want is to be able to function in this world and achieve things. However, right now and looking back on my past and the slow tiny progress I have made, this seems like it will never happen for me.

It's a little hard for me to say ""abused"" as there's a part of me that feels it was all so surreal. Like I had made it up in my head. Even as I've opened up to select people in my offline life, and they've called it abuse, I still find it hard to believe. I still feel like a drama queen. I mean, it wasn't that bad. Although I do have a whole range of trust issues and the like, I'm trying, and it's really hard. Trying to trust. Trying to take a chance on people. Trying to get through each day. And right now, trying not to cry because I've uni work to do ha, ha. I suddenly remembered something that my psychologist (have stopped seeing her for a while now) once said about how I missed out on so much as a child. That thought is upsetting.

The relationship is 100% emotional and verbal abuse. He has called me every name under the sun, while also blaming me for his depression and suicidal thoughts. Tonight he once again blamed me for his unhappiness, and started claiming he has bulimia just to trigger some sort of response from me. He expects me to beg at his feet and do anything to save him and this relationship. I used to, but not anymore. This same guy forces me into sexual acts no matter where I am or what I am doing. My uncle committed suicide 2 months after my friend passed away, and instead of being there for me and supporting me, he threatened suicide if I didn't perform sexual acts for him.

Yet I have been having one hell of a time finding the courage to end it. Every single day I dread hearing from him again. I put myself into panic attacks when I see him calling my phone or sending me a message, because I expect him to treat me like garbage again until I do whatever he wants.

PTSD-1907,Severe Anxiety-PTSD (physical symptoms too much),"Hi All, I've been suffering horrible physical symptoms from anxiety and PTSD. It's been ongoing for almost 5 weeks now. I recently lost a planned pregnancy through ectopic surgery (about nine weeks ago). It has left me with extreme sadness, shock and the whole process was traumatic and caused me severe anxiety from the medical experience. I've always suffered from anxiety, but never experienced this unpleasantness before, except from a previous panic attack I had. my anxiety is mainly health related at this stages. I've seen several GPs, had blood tests done and all have given me the same feedback- it's anxiety. I've started to see a psychologist to help me deal with this. the daily symptoms include, dizziness and headaches and inability to focus. I've had trembling, shaking, itching and sweating and difficulty swallowing too. its been a vicious cycle, as soon as I start feeling it, I panic and worry something bad is happening to me which exasperates the symptoms. it's taking over my life and I just want to get better. i'm constantly replaying the event in my mind and it gets worst every Wednesday (the day I had the surgery to remove it). everytime I experience the symptoms, I panic and think something is wrong the doctors have missed something. i've pretty much recovered 100% physically. I just want to feel like myself again. breathing exercises are helping, but wondering what other techniques people have used. anyone experiencing similar symptoms? Thanks in advance.

PTSD-1909,Should I seek professional help?,"Hi every one Im new at this so hope Im doing things correctly. Cant believe I have butterflies lol. I need to ask advice in regards to PTSD. I havent been diagnosed with it as such (only severe depression) although my last psych mentioned that I had it after I was telling her a few things, but she didnt give me any advice nor informed my GP. Anyhow, a couple of days ago I had a flashback of a particular incident that happened when I was a teenager (Im now 52) while being sexually abused. The scene was very graphic and now I cant seem to shake it, or train my brain to stop thinking about it. I dont know what sparked the flashback, I just had an odd feeling or sensation then the memory came back. It sickens me to the core and I now it is affecting the way I am acting, thinking and dealing with people. Should I go to my GP and get referred to another psych, as the last one, and many before her, hasnt helped me, or is this just something that will keep happening regardless of any intervention? Ive actually thought of getting hypnosis to stop me ever thinking about my abuse but Im scared of losing apart of myself (if that makes sense?). I just need my brain to stop allowing all the memories popping up and reliving all those horrific times it happened. Even when I take anti depressants the thoughts come back.

I've been through the ringer with mental health facilities etc. I just want to know if anyone has experienced the same as me. I'd like to feel less alone. This is my first baby, if you don't count the one I lost a year ago. And I feel nothing but Dread. I have no idea what I'm doing and trying to figure it all out on my own, in my house with the internet.

PTSD-1913,High profile abusers,"Hi everyone. When I was 14 I was sexually assaulted by a school teacher on two occasions, the teacher was moved on and I've dealt with it in my own ways since. Fast forward 20 years, and this person is now fairly high profile in my community. I see him in local papers, sometimes on TV, etc... There is also an even higher profile person who has been trying to make me sign letters saying I was not abused, etc... The Dept of Education is paying for my psychological treatment, and the Royal Commission is involved. But the day to day anxiety and panic attacks have gotten much worse in recent times.

PTSD-1915,Did anything wrong happen?,"I keep replaying these scenes in my head and I feel tormented.My dad, my brother and I went to Queensland to visit my dads half sister when I was 10. She had 3 kids, a girl a bit older than me, a son my age, and another son 3-4 years older so he was 13-14 at the time. The oldest, he was very big for his age, not fat but quite built, a bit muscly and hefty. He seemed a bit older than his age. He was known to be very troublesome, known for being violent, sadistic, teasing people and torturing animals. I never disliked him at this point but I did feel a bit scared of him. I was a thin small girl at this point, I had not even hit puberty yet.We stayed there for I think about a week. And from what I can remember, I think every day, that older male cousin has been abusing me...I think, or trying to... Im confused as to if he did or not.It would usually be that I was in the study room, playing a game on the computer, and he would come in and close the door. There were other times too when he made inapporpriate suggestions. I remember refusing and running away.All I know is when I think of that time there, I feel really sick, dirty, I feel confused, I feel there is more but my mind just cannot put it all together. I remember from then on, I was always very awkward and scared about guys touching me or being sexual towards me. I keep reliving the moments more and more lately.I feel traumatized but should I?

PTSD-1917,"Realization, affected by family abuse","Hi, Some of you may have seen me post something like this in another thread, I wanted to start the descussion anew in the appropriate forum. Maybe others will have similar experiences to share that I can draw from and vise versa. Since staying with my sister and being around my immediate family again I have had an epiphany. I think the reason that I cannot shake the black dog, aside from it being likely a lifelong journey, is that it was born of abuse. My mother was emotionally abusive from the day I was born. She was also physically violent for most of my childhood. I already knew this but for some reason thought that I was unaffected because of that knowledge. I have no idea why I thought that but upon further reflection it makes complete sense. It’s the reason that all 4 of us siblings are struggling with varying degrees of depression, anxiety and mental illness. I have spent most of my life lifting the mirror up to my mother so that she can grow and stop the abuse, I was successful in stopping the physical abuse by the time my youngest sister was born but the emotional is harder to see and harder to fix, it continues today and i continue to hold up that mirror. My mother was bused by her father emotionally, physically and sexually. And in turn he was abused by his father. It is a cycle that is beginning to break down as each generation gets better and heals. I am blown away that I never saw it. I have been on my journey so long I just can’t believe I didn’t put the pieces together. Approching my mental health with this in mind is completely new to me, I've always assumed that I would have mental health issues regardless of my mothers abuse, brothers abuse and family traumas I have endured. But I seem to suddenly see with clear eyes. Anyone else have a similar story? and how are you dealing with it?

PTSD-1918,Can't pull out of it,"I have suffered depression on and off since I had my daughter - I had had a fantastic last 2 years with no anxiety or depression although I still take meds. I recently came out of a relationship I now understand was very toxic. I fell in love with someone I knew was bad for me, when I tried to discuss issues I was having with him, he dismissed them as being my problem, he didn't seem to want to work on anything with me. Cut a long story short, we had a fight, he did a couple of things over the next week and I distanced myself completely - in fact I went completely numb. I knew I could no longer be in the relationship, when he contacted me I pushed back any sexual suggestions and focused on life - but i was still numb in my heart. He came to my house at 3am about 3 weeks later, was very drunk and attacked me mentally over a 3 hour period and left ""love bites"" all up my arm and on my chest which were very painful when he was doing them but he kept pulling my arm to him and biting harder. He was saying some really degrading and things that I just didnt understand. In the morning I asked him if he remembered what he had done, he said yes, I still don't know if he did. Anyway, my arm and chest were black in bruising, when he msg'd me a couple of days later I just lost it. I didn't know at the time but I had PTSD symptoms from the incident. I have no contact with him now - I just cannot deal with what he did nor understand what I did to deserve it. I have put on a brave face pulling myself up to finish assignments and exams but I am now 2 months later completely empty inside. I was so happy, confident and strong in my job and study before I met him and I just lost myself. I just can't shake this empty feeling I have - no feelings and I just don't care at the core. I am trying hard to get out and do things, have made some social group connections but I can't stop replaying what happened and understand how he could do that to me.

PTSD-1919,Supporting a girlfriend who has been sexually abused in the past,"Hello, thanks for your time. I have been dating a girl for a little over 4 months and I have noticed a major change in behaviour. On the night we began a relationship I found out my girlfriend had been sexually abused as both a child and young adult. She told ne she didn't like sex and I reassured her I was okay with this. A month or so in she began to make a few moves on me and we had some intimate touching (no intercourse). About 2 months later we had sex and I was a bit confused as she had said she didnt want to, so I went slowly and made sure the wholw time she knew I care about her and she shouldnt be scared to say if she wanted to stop. From then on things have gone downhill. She no longer is willing to cuddle / hold hands / have me within a 1m radius. I've talked to her a few times and reassured her that I don't care if we ever have sex again or not. I love this girl and just enjoy being around her and spending time together. She told me cuddles are good before sex but now we have had it there is an expectation that we have to do it again. Ive tried to tell her thats not the case at all. She is still uncomfortable however. She has just moved home and she is quite stressed. I believe this is also part of the reason why she is so distanced at the moment. She sees a doctor to help with her depression and she is on medication. She has told me her shes having troubles with anexiety also. Little things annoy her at the moment, such as leaving a bag in a wrong place etc. We have talked about it and she said it makes her feel bad that she is annoyed by it as it then makes me feel bad. I'm now trying to not 'let it get to me' when she complains about something small. Been doing it for a few days and not sure if its helping yet or not. With the worry about cuddling I've tried to staybat mine more rather than staying at hers. (I had practically moved in beforehand; this change is also partly due to me getting a new job). I've looked through the articles on this website and maybe giving her space is the wrong thing to do? I want to know if there is something I can do to help her through this tough time? Normally I'd hug someone when they are upset or feeling down. I understand why she has this personal space issue and id really like to know how I can support her from afar? Today I completely cleaned her house while she is out and left a note with a couple of chocolates. Is this the right course of action or should I look at coming to the doctor with her?",BobFisher3,Community Member,05-09-2016,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/supporting-a-girlfriend-who-has-been-sexually-abused-in-the-past/td-p/261550
PTSD-1920,Growing up too fast! *warning possible triggers*,"All suffering in my life stems from my own incompetence... This was the line feed to me the first time I was sexualy abused by my uncle at 12, I didn't understand it at the time but that moment has stuck with me throughout my life, he explained that if I were stronger or less ' gull able "" that this would never have happened! Personally I believe this to be the occasion that changed my life and ended my childhood. A year later and its time to go too my uncles house again for new years, my body breaks out into a sweat and I struggle too keep the contents of my stomach down as I think about the things he said and did. At the time I wanted to scream in protest that I never want to go back there but the threat he made about my little brother and sister being next if I told anyone stopped me. I couldn't chance it even if he was bluffing I didn't want my siblings going through this too so I soldiered on in silence trying to get through the night without running into him 100 people would have been there easily so it wasn't to hard to disappear into the crowd of people once we got there and I was heading straight to my cousin Abel . older then me I knew he would have alcohol stashed away for later so I went and bought some off him with the money I earnt from work. First time drunk I stumbel out of the car me and my cousin were drinking laughing I sneak to the shed were Abel had stashed the liquor. ""Ah welp there you are* my uncles voice snaps me out of my drunken state as I ready to bolt I turn around too see a woman there with him. Confused and not wanting to make a scene in case this lady caught on and then my uncle take it out on my brother and sister I poised myself and smiled and waved. The lady gave me a once over that made me nervous even at that age. "" he is gonna be a big man that's for sure "" stroking my cheek I knew what was coming she had the same look in her eyes my uncle did.

PTSD-1922,Do I have a mental Illness,"Hi, So I am unsure how to start or where, I looked at other posts but still not sure if this is right, I'm really sorry if this is wrong. Today I am trying to have the music up loud in my head phones to drown out the thoughts, I don't even know where to start. I just know things are getting a lot harder and it's getting harder to ignore and push them aside. I'm stuck between continue to ignore how I am or to talk to someone (every time I see a ""professional"" I just pretend I'm ok - I hate the questions, I hate the feeling of having to explain what I have been through, when my own family don't even know) . My family are amazing brought up in the country an moved to the city with my mother who kept me when my family pushed her away for being single (my father didnt want a girl). My mother looks after kids in and out of care and spends most of her time with special needs kids. I lover and adore her, but my beliefs of what a mother should be like are changing while I grow up and have realized she made me feel like i was the outside kid without even noticing. I have had multiple ""situations"" that a child should never have had to go through or feel it was there fault and to hide it. To feel even the people who are meant to support you and protect you don't want you to speak up so the ""next time"" it happens.. you blame yourself and definitely don't tell anyone. I don't think i can say anymore, I just know it's getting so hard to keep this all inside. How do people cope!? This all happened years ago, I have been so tough and I wasn't thinking about it.. but now its almost every day. My family wouldn't understand and I would never want to break them up, i don't want to go see a professional - I find I just can't let them in or fully tell them the truth. I guess I'm trying to figure out life... my two best mates over the past 3 years have committed suicide and i just don't have the guts to do what they did. I'm more the silent thinker and doubter with numbness, I broke off a 6 year relationship - Jumped into another one (no idea why - just happened) I wasn't good enough for him anyway's so I broke that off. I had a major car accident and heard the people say I was dead when infact I wasn't - Just alot to happen in roughly 4 years. I'm just wanting to know how do people pull themselves out of this?

PTSD-1928,Worried mum,"My three primary school age children have been living exclusively with me for three months, after nearly five years of them going between my house and their father's house, since they reported to me the details of domestic violence/abuse by their father. The abuse has since been reported to the police and my children have been seeing domestic violence support and mental health counsellors. We have a court date next month, where I hope to be able to change the legal custody arrangements so that my children can live with me, but have the choice when/if they see their father. This has been a very difficult time for me, because I do not like the fact that I have felt the need to breach a court order, I am concerned for the relationship my children will have with their father in the future and despite what has been reported, I feel for their father and his situation because he must be hurting too having not seen his kids during this time. I had to weigh all of this up when I made the decision to help my kids to have time away from their dad, rather than co-operate with the order. I acted on their requests when they begged me not to be returned to him. I have spent many nights with them helping them to drift off to sleep and be strong for the night-mares and the worries which come to them. I have tried to keep their life as normal as possible, but this has involved some missed school when the anxiety levels have been high, and as I mentioned, help from psychologists for them to begin to process their feelings from what has happened. I don't know what the outcome of the court case will be. There is always a possibility that they may be ordered back to their father's care. Although they have pleaded for this not to happen, I can not tell them with 100% certainity that this will not be the case. Meanwhile, I have found that I am feeling quite alone (I don't know anyone going through this). I know there is stigma out there around ""those women who do/say terrible things so they get to keep the kids"". I know I am not one of those women. I agreed to an almost 50/50 arrangement with my ex- almost 5 years ago and co-operated with that until the disclosures were made. What I dearly want is for my kids dad to acknowledge his part in their refusal to see him and to make some changes, rather than blindly blame me for withholding them.

PTSD-1929,PTSD & Loneliness go hand in hand (TRIGGER WARNING SEXUAL ABUSE),"In November 2012 my life changed.

I've since divorced and am in another relationship, although not sure about how long this one will last.

It's when I'm alone that I break down and fall to pieces. I have thoughts of suicide quite often but my children are what keep me alive. Is this feeling of loneliness common with sufferers of PTSD? Is it common for sufferers of PTSD to experience relationship breakdowns? A story that has been on the news lately has kept my memories quite close to the surface and that's not helping. But something that cannot be avoided either. I'm not sure if I'm asking for advice or if I'm just wanting to put my feelings ""out there"". Nevertheless, there it is.

Best friends make the worst enemies. I am struggling with it...their words continue to go round and around in my head...I'm finding it hard not to question myself. Some days I get 20 txts at a time.

PTSD-1933,"Too scared to seek help, where do  start?","I was abused for many years as a child by a family member who committed suicide when I was in my teens. Since then I have had persistent PTSD symptoms such as flashbacks, triggers, nightmares, aggression and extreme mood swings. No body in my life knows about the abuse so I feel extremely isolated but seem to have been able to 'switch off' that part of me when Im around others so I appear 'normal' and my issues stay undetected. It has been about 10 years since my abuser died and I was so hoping I would gain some closure from that event but I am still haunted daily by horrific memories that repeat themselves over and over. I have only been brave enough to see a psychologist once and I never had the courage to reveal my abuse and then just stopped showing up to appointments because I felt like a coward. I know deep down I need to deal with this, the symptoms arent easing with time and as my friends start to have children I am finding myself being triggered more and more often. I need advice on where to go and how to find help. I also have very little money and I'm too scared/embarrassed to say to a GP that Ive been abused.... I just don't know how to deal with this. Any help/advice from people in similar situations would really be appreciated.

PTSD-1934,Fight with my partner turned physical,"Hi everyone, Just really needed to get this off my chest and although it doesn't compare to what most are going through it would still be nice to get it all out there. My partner and I for the last month have been struggling with trust issues and going through a stage of rebuilding and all was going really well until Saturday night. We had both been drinking heavily at an event and when we were just about to go to bed he went through my phone and began to become really angry at me over really not much. The fight escalated fast and turned really physical on both our ends. I was grabbing and pushing him and he too was hurting me. I woke up with scratches all over me, my arm bruised from how hard he was grabbing me, face scratched from his watch, and even a bite mark on my arm. I just don't know what to do as I too was very physical with him and the only reason I was hurt more was because he is much stronger then me but I don't feel like I can blame him just because he is the man as I was doing pretty much the same stuff (I didn't go as far as biting however). We are both completely traumatised from the event and although we have had huge fights before and his rage is a prominent issue in our relationship, it has never gone that far. We are both so sad from it that I have just let him back into the house as we don't want to not see each other. But was this the wrong thing to do? Should I be punishing him? I am just so lost and feeling very lonely.. Thanks a lot",Lil_b,Community Member,15-08-2016,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/fight-with-my-partner-turned-physical/td-p/273918
PTSD-1935,Aggressive husband and no escape,"As with any other story here, my situation is complex and I would like to give you a few words of introduction. I got married to an Australian two years ago. A few months later our daughter was born. When she was just 6 months old we found out that my husband is seriously ill and we had to come to Australia for him to get a proper treatment. He promised me that I will be able to go back home with our daughter anytime (I'd had doubts about going so far away with him after he had been not very nice to me but of course his illness was more important at the moment than my worries - he didn't do anything violent, just started snapping at me). So I came to Australia and he started his treatment which unfortunately required him taking steroids. His doctor warned us that this might impact on my husbands mood. And it did. He started being very aggressive towards me for no reason, called me a bitch, threw things at me, hit me with the door (he said it was an accident but I know he did it on purpose). I never made any friends in Australia as I was scared that I will have to talk about my family life. I just took care of our daughter and tried to persuade him to let me go back home but he refused. He said I can go alone without our daughter if I want and this is not an option. His treatment went well, he was taking lower doses of drugs and was a bit better to me but I stopped loving him. We didn't have sex since we came to Australia, I don't like when he touches me or tries to hug me. I feel that he betrayed my trust. He decided he doesn't want to go to work (he can afford it). I decided I have to work tohave some independence. So my life now is waking up before he wakes up, commuting for 2 hours, working for 8 hours, commuting for 2 hours and just seeing my daughter for an hour before she goes to sleep. Then I go to sleep. Weekends are better but I have to spend time with him and it is not pleasant. He asked me to pay all our bills so after I pay them, I have no money left. A month ago his illness relapsed and he started being aggressive again. The chance of me going home are 0 as when he is sick he will stay in Australia. I feel my life doesn't make sense anymore. I have nothing to look forward to. I would like to leave him but he will not let me take my daughter with me as he is the one who takes care of her. And if I quit my job and take care of her, I won't have money to rent an apartment and provide for her. I don't know where to start fixing my life.",Kate123123,Community Member,14-08-2016,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/aggressive-husband-and-no-escape/td-p/273860
PTSD-1936,Continuing depression stemming from abuse,"Just one cause of depression is childhood abuse by my father from at least 6 to 15. I can only put this out in dribbles as I cannot cope with more informing, but at 15 I attempted to take my life for the first time. I can't say at present any more about that. That is the trouble no matter what amazing help I get nothing takes that issue away. The effect on self esteem is still huge although I have a great partner and wonderful children.

PTSD-1937,Not sure if I have PTSD,"Hi, I've never been on a forum before... I was in hospital in isolation for around 15 days and due to an autoimmune response to pnemonia my face and body were disfigured. I couldn't recognize myself in the mirror, barely open my mouth because my lips were so swollen and I needed breathing assistance. After leaving the hospital and my face healing up I still Have trouble recognizing myself because I had lost so much weight during the process (which isn't a bad thing) but it freaks me out. Now that I'm home I can't sleep because everytime I close my eyes I see my face all disfigured, when i cough I start having a panic attack because I think I'm going to choke again and I'm extremely high strung. I already have a panic disorder which isn't helping the situation but i was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this? I'de like to stop re living the whole experience but it won't go away and it's basically all I think about all the time and it really scares me.

PTSD-1938,My first time here - diagnosed with PTSD last year,"Hi world, I was diagnosed with PTSD last year and after making leaps and bounds for some time I have managed to face plant into a few walls recently. I have seeing psychologists for like 7 years and I thought that maybe I was be getting somewhere but this new diagnosis on top of the depression, anxiety and chronic pain just kicks me about. I have started to scare myself and as it turns out my breakdown the other night also scared my partner. I have always been so good at hiding my mental health and putting on the sunny face for everyone but the other night I drank and I lost myself in from of the one I love most. If you had asked me a few months ago what the word trigger means I would have probably just said something off the top of my head, but now it sits deep in my emotions. Trigger now means fear, loss of control, pain, repeating my mantra 'just stay alive', it's a battle of constantly being in fear of how something may effect you. When I get triggered I lose touch. I stare at photos of my niece, that at every other moment of my life I love with everything, and try and connect with her I try to find that feeling but it's no longer there. The urge to punish yourself is so strong that it takes everything you have to not hurt yourself, to stay alive. Right now I know that is not me. Right now I can look at it all and say that it is a disorder and it will get better. The triggers will get further apart. The complete loss of the rational brain, the person inside my body, is a great one that I mourn once I come back to reality and look back at how far I fell this episode. I am here because my partner asked me to reach out to BB. I don't know how to deal with all this pain. The vicious cycle. I hope that this post can help people to feel not alone, and perhaps I will get some of that relief myself? How do you truly just ask for something without giving something first? I want to live.",R3dr0s3,Community Member,01-08-2016,PTSD and trauma,11,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/my-first-time-here-diagnosed-with-ptsd-last-year/td-p/255723
PTSD-1939,You know me.,"I live in your town, work in your community, I work hard, play hard. You say hi to me at the supermarket. You know me. You know I never served in a war, but you don't know about the trauma that changed my life. I've never been in a war zone... Except for the one in my head. The one where my own body becomes my enemy, as I struggle to slow my breathing, still my shaking hands, stop the panic that invades every fibre of my being. I couldn't hold a gun, even if I wanted to. I know the science; my body is responding physiologically to a perceived threat. I know that in this moment, there is no threat. But my brain is searching for an enemy, sweeping the room for dangers, identifying potential exits... The enemy it's seeking, is itself. My brain is telling my body to go into fight or flight. Or freeze. I can't choose. I can be stuck there for days. You can't possibly know I haven't slept properly in days. If you did know that, you'd tell me to get some rest, relax. I can't. Because science. My brain is creating chemicals that tell me to be alert, be hyper vigilant. My reactions seem excessive to you. They are excessive. And there are days in my life when despite knowing that, I cannot control my physiological symptoms. When I found the words to adequately convey the scale of my terror... His response was ""Wow. It's noisy in your head. I don't like it here."" He knows me. Loves me; despite knowing that sometimes I can't talk, get out of bed, be the friend or sister or daughter or aunt or colleague that he needs me to be. Sometimes it is all I can do just to breathe. I know you find that difficult to comprehend. An exaggeration. An impossibility. If I truly was experiencing these symptoms and thoughts, especially for extended periods of time... I must surely explode? I don't; I implode. You might know that I suffer episodes of manic depression. You have noticed there have been times when I have simply vanished; from my home, my job, my life. Or maybe you didn't notice I was gone. Maybe you noticed when I came back, that you hadn't seen me in a while... I seemed quieter. Flatter. Cautious. Even when I am back, functioning, contributing, ""my usual self"", in control... There is still a part of me that is still scanning the room, checking the exits. You may know me, but you don't see me. You can't. I live in your town, work in your community, I work hard, play hard.

PTSD-1941,Recovering from a car accident,"My husband (Dean) was home on his first RNR from FIFO and on the Sunday 28th February we decided to do a bit of gardening before heading to the shops with my mum too (visiting from QLD). On our way home we decided to get some video's to watch for the afternoon/evening. We reversed parked at the video car park, always on the end as we had a new car. It was a hot day and my mum and I got a ice-cream and Dean a cool drink. Dean went to the car to cool it off. I followed put my hand bag in the back seat (behind the driver). I said to Dean ""we won't be long, just finish our ice-creams in the shade"". I closed the door and walking past the front of the car and I suddenly heard this noise; I turned and couldn't believe my eyes !! At that point - 28/02/16 - 2:45pm - after 5 weeks of being married - our lives changed in seconds !! An out of control driver was laughing at speed and t-boned our car, when I turned he was launched. I was screaming !!! I yelled out to a man sitting in his car ""CALL the emergency services"" - I ran to the cars to ensure it wasn't going to burst into flames and rushed to Dean's aid. He was in shock. Everything happened so fast. We rushed to emergency to were Dean had to undergo critical surgery. He was resuscitated and placed on life support transferred to ICU. Split Liver, damage to kidneys, fractured ribs/spine, smashed ankle. With many weeks in ICU/Trauma ward, dealing with the life changing event, deal with unsupportive parent-inlaws, drams with insurance companies and the list goes on. Nearly 22weeks later things are looking up. Physio has started now after many ops, but unlikely to returning to work till the new year. Dean has to deal with the physically side and I seem to be trying to deal with the mental side. Seeing it happen, unable to protect my husband, coming so close to death myself, now dealing with the knock on effect it has had in our life's has been challenging.

PTSD-1943,Emotional flashbacks really sting my heart,"I really struggle with emotional flashbacks of complicit bystanders to my child abuse. I have had years and years of therapy that continues to this day. I exercise, eat well, I love my friends, I have dependable employment, I have the best clinical psychologist in the southern hemisphere and do everything ""you're meant to do"" when you have complex PTSD. Despite this, I just can't budge the pain in my heart when I am being flooded with emotional flashbacks to one of the most hurtful elements of the violent sexual assault in my early life. I was raped in front of my perpetrators wife and she did nothing. In fact she started giving me gifts. I was raised in a house with ""parents, who should never have been parents"" if you know what I mean. What this meant in light of my assault is that it reinforced the feelings of 'disregard' and 'worthlessness' that I felt when a mother figure did not save me, and in fact endorsed the crime, never to mention a word to authorities. My parents unfortunately kept my nervous system in a state of perpetual shock. I know this must sound ridiculous and way over sensitive, but an example of me struggling with emotional flashbacks when I'm in their grasp, would be my boss, or another authority figure rolls their eyes at me, or gives me negative feedback on the job, or simply does not say hello. It may just be other females in the office not liking me. This triggers all my grief and intense sadness. I time travel back decades to the precise second when I saw her presence once the violence was over, and her cold inaction at my powerlessness. I run to the toilets at work and I burst into tears like a teenage girl. I have done so much inner work that I am consciously aware that I have had an emotional reaction that is ""out of context"", that I am safe, that I have people that love me..........and yet the sting in my heart is so intense some days I just want to go to a deserted island and cry until sunset. I don't feel like a bottomless pit of depression is in front of me. I feel like a bottomless pit of grief and sadness is. I don't know how to help that heal when I have been so deeply betrayed by both sexes. I love all my friends. But there's also a part of me that is secretly scared of them. It's like I'm crouching and waiting for people to hurt me. Does anyone else experience emotional flashbacks to trauma that you intellectually know are 'old wounds' and nothing to stress about, and yet they sting like hell?",Cornstarch,Community Member,31-07-2016,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/emotional-flashbacks-really-sting-my-heart/td-p/213556
PTSD-1944,PTSD from MVA (Motor Vehicle Accident),"I was 18 years old when I had my car accident, it was on boxing day 2012. I was driving back home after spending Christmas with my family, driving a 1993 corolla, so no airbags. About an hour into my way home it started to rain, nothing to heavy. I was almost halfway home and excited to enjoy my gifts from Christmas. As I was coming around a bend on the road another car was also but lost control and smashed into me at over 100km per hour. I was hit on the driver side door (T-Bone). The impact broke 4 of my ribs, I was bleeding into my stomach and lacerated my liver and spleen also puncturing a lung. As I was in shock, the car behind the one that hit me pulled over. A women was running towards me and just happened to be a nurse on her way to work at the local hospital. She kicked in the back door window and crawled in. She was comforting me as best she could, saying it was going to be ok and it wasnt to bad. At this stage I was coughing blood, I thought I was going to die. It wasnt to long till police arrived, they also just comforted me until an ambulance arrived. The police called in the fire brigade to cut me out of the car as it was completely smashed in. That took over an hour, I was then placed on a spinal and taken to the ambulance. Still being in shock and not knowing what was going on I started saying my goodbyes, to loved ones. After being in the ambulance for about half an hour I then was taken to be airlifted to hospital. I spent 5 days in ICU (Intensive care unit) and further 7 in surgical ward. Its been almost 4 years since that day but during that time since the crash my mental health was actually worse then the initial car crash was because it lasted so much longer. Having 14 hospital admissions for suicidal thoughts/attempts within 3 years after the accident. I still struggle with my crash, everyday of my life. But things get better. I am getting the proper treatment for PTSD and am in my first year of Uni and that is something I never saw for myself. I have gotten through the worst of it now and am planning for my future which is still weird for me to say.

PTSD-1945,Just need to tell my story (trigger warning),"Hi, on the 2/7/13 I had a car accident. My children were in the car with me. My son 5, daughter 8, and daughter 18. My 18yr old was 34 weeks pregnant. We had only just confirmed the pregnancy - she was in denial and although I could see that she was pregnant, it took alot of convincing for her to accept that she was. We were all really happy. My car rolled 6 times. No-one knows why. We don't remember. My son broke both legs his nose and eye socket, my 8yr old daughter broke both legs an arm and the bone that connects the neck to the skull, my 18yr old broke her foot her knee her femur her pelvis and her neck. Her baby, my grandson was delivered stillborn later at the hospital. I also had injuries, but that doesn't matter. I feel like I deserve that. I don't know how to live with what happened. The police told me that I was not speeding. I was not doing anything on my phone. I knew, but they confirmed I had no drugs or alcohol in my system. They said I must have just lost concentration. They charged with negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. I have now been diagnosed with PTSD. I have nightmares of trying to get my car back on the road. Fighting to get control. I can hear my children screaming. I don't go anywhere. I'm terrified of getting in the car. I haven't driven since the accident. I can't be around babies.

PTSD-1946,Living with PTSD for 10 years and still no better,"Hi All, I have been a single parent for 9 years now after being in an abusive relationship (emotional, mental, financial and some physical and sexual abuse) for nearly 10 years, from which I developed PTS, but was no officially diagnosed with PTSD until 5 years after developing the symptoms. I have been under a number of treatments both chemical and psychological over the past 4 years and have found the chemical treatments side effects to become quite unbearable and invasive in my life, though everytime I manage to get a rapport with a psychologist/ counselor they would either take extended leave or move from my area all together (I am in a rural community), I have even gone as far as admitting myself to a mental health unit through fear of my own safety. Though have found that upon discharge from the inpatient unit there is no services offered to help me in dealing with what I am feeling. The way I am feeling is so turbulent. At night I find I cannot sleep, or wake in fright from night terrors. I find myself socially isolated and find I have major anxiety when out and around others, especially when I am forced to go into an area where my ex husband frequents. Though my biggest fear is in my own home, where the behaviours of my two older children mimic the abuse their father use to direct at me, this puts my PTSD at a whole new level, I will hide in my bedroom and pretend to be asleep, or will go out in my car to get away from the abuse. I have no external family support as my family walked away from me last year, and the only two friends I do have, have abusive partners themselves, so I avoid them if possible. I feel like I am reliving the relationship I was once in and feel powerless to control the situation I am in. When I was in that abusive relationship I attempted to take my life twice, this is not a road I want to follow down again, and when those thoughts get in my head it frightens me to the core. I am sick of living with PTSD and just want a life with some happiness in it, but am finding each door I seem to open gets shut in my face.",Singlebutterfly,Community Member,13-07-2016,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/living-with-ptsd-for-10-years-and-still-no-better/td-p/183768

PTSD-1948,PTSD with Surgery awareness - There is always help! (trigger warning),"I would like to share my journey of PTSD. Hope it can help others. This was a surgery for my 2nd Hernia operation. I suffered by what they refer to as “surgery awareness”. I’m a Male, 40 years old - Sydney. I was taken into the operating room, I was placed onto the operating table, strapped down and I was given a oxygen mask and told to breath deep by the Anaesthetist. Within a few minutes I was not able move my body, eyes or talk but I could feel everything, I could see but not blink. There was a small pillow under my head (I was overweight). The Dr and his assistant gave me 6 large needles (both at the same time) into my Hernia area (belly button). The pain was the worst pain I have ever felt in my life and no way to tell them, I was tortured. I was screaming for them to stop - but no one could hear me. I believe I was given these needles because it was going to take 10 minutes to take effect and they could prepare the surgery in the mean time. After the 6th needle I believe I passed out and when I woke the room was empty and dark, the light was off or pointing away from me. I could not see anyone and thought I was dead for 3-4 minutes. I felt like I was on an Autopsy table. I was looking down my bear chest and could not see my chest move (telling me I was not breathing), I could not move, I could not even blink and I had no feeling to my body except total fear of having my organs cut from my body by someone walking in the room. During this time I remember screaming for help but no words were coming out my mouth. I was screaming “I'm not dead! Please help me”. Still no one could hear me - even the Anaesthetist or any of her monitors were not showing any kind of problem (as I found out later on - 11 months later), they had not put a brain monitor on me at this stage. They put me under a few minutes later. 12 months later. I’m seeing a counsellor for these PTSD issues but he can only help me so much. I need real answers. I am writing this hear because I want people to know that if a Dr does something wrong to you, speak up. Tell a Dr, Nurse or anyone in the hospital to get it resolved. Please do not hold it back. I did this and it just eats me up inside everyday. Once I spoke out I felt such a relief and weight off my shoulders. I could not talk to my family about this as they just said “get over it” and don’t understand the deep issues it holds.

PTSD-1950,Long post; I want to forget (trigger warning: sexual assault details),"Hello, This is my first time posting, second time talking about this. I guess the only way to begin is to just say it. When I was 18 I was trapped in a physically abusive relationship, too scared to leave , terrified on staying. He used to always force me to touch him, if not I coped it. I didnt think it was that bad, At the time I thought it could always be worse, this was happening for a while. It never esculated past that point. But one day it changed. I dont remember what happened. All I remember was going to his house as told, then waking up on my front lawn feeling disorientated, head fuzzy and completely weak. Being a virgin ,I noticed almost right away I was sore down there, and there was blood. I havent gone to the police, I didnt tell anyone. The only person who knows is my now boyfriend. Even then I couldnt tell him, I just handed him my diary and left him for a few days. If I didnt have the night terrors of my ex beating me and forcing me , I wouldnt have told him. Its been years. I should be over this right? I have no memory of what happend with losing my virginity but I dream of it. I dream of being there, feeling the pain and having no control or strength in my body to move. I dont know what happened. But its all coming to me and I have no idea what to do, how to cope. I just want to forget. I was doing fine, but now if any one even yells near me I panic, I start crying ,tensing and I just want to drop to the floor and cover my head. My boyfriend now has been really supportive ,but pushing me to talk to a professional or at least get him charged. I just cant do it, soon as I go to do something I freeze and I panic ,what happens if he gets away with it, and gets angry again. Or if he finds me. I dont know what to do, but between the event being replayed in my dreams over and over I just cant sleep, I am getting paranoid hes going to be angry with me telling my bf. I should be over this. Its been 6 years. I dont know if I want advice or just to rant.

PTSD-1951,My New story about sexual abuse! Trigger alert.,"Im new to BB and I feel its time I share my story. Im pleased to feel a mutual respect from people on here already. It means a lot.Growing up by age 5, my mum and dad got divorced, the break up was ugly, dad had become moody and I witnessed violence towards mum.Fast forward two years, mum had met another man and he had moved in. 'John' and mum hit it off, John moving in not too long after that. John had a son Rick who was 12, I was 7 or 8. Things moved so quickly at that stage, Rick was staying most weekend, we got along really well always on our bikes and kicking the footy. I did notice that Rick was a bit of a bully though, he would order me around. I didnt really care much he was older so I was ok with it, I looked up to him. I felt relieved for my mum that she was back to being happy after that divorce. Now Rick was a 12 year old but he was 5'10 huge for his age, one night while in the same bedroom but seperate beds, Rick kept asking me questions about sex.I was 7, I had no idea and got embarassed. Rick persisted and he told me he wanted to show me things, I didnt know what to do. I became uncomfortable yet curious ""what was he doing with himself""? He said I needed to keep this a secret if any one found out his Dad would send him back Perth. Then he abused me. I was too young confused and scared at what just happened. Mum and 'John' got married, Rick was almost over every weekend, he did as he wished for two long years until 'John,' mums new husband suicided. No warnings, no suicide note. My poor Mum, Rick had just lost his Dad. The abuse stopped. My bioloigcal Dad is gone, my step Dad is gone and my step brother who I still looked up to had gone. I felt abandoned and ashamed. I'm 31 now I managed lock my past away for some time but I knew I was damaged goods. I tried my best to lead a normal life but my brain shut down. Depression, PTSD and anxiety took over. Im taking anti-depressants which have side effects. I have a really good GP and admitted to him my past for the first time, I didnt get out of bed for three days after that. I know I can beat my darkness to a point. My innocence was robbed. I hope this helps somene out there! Ill be here for you!

PTSD-1952,How do I get over the shame of a sexual assault?,I feel so ashamed and overwhelmed. 20 yrs ago I was sexually assaulted by 2 men on a night out. I never told anyone because I was so ashamed that it must've been my fault because I drank too much. I was left battered and bruised and had to hide it from my family because I thought I'd get into trouble. I have a very loving and patient husband but I feel so awkward being intimate. I feel like I never want anyone to touch me again. He knows all about my past and wants to support me but I can't seem to break down these barriers. I'm on antidepressants for post natal depression which I suffered after having both of our children. I feel like I'm constantly trying to climb out of a black hole and I'm really exhausted. I'd love any advice. Thank you for reading this.,Sandy19,Community Member,04-07-2016,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/how-do-i-get-over-the-shame-of-a-sexual-assault/td-p/262074
PTSD-1953,FEELING OVER-WHELMED,"I have never posted in here before. No-one understands why I get over-whelmed at times and why I cannot cope with noise. I do volunteer work and really love it; it has really helped with my depression/trauma/PSTD. But sometimes when it gets busy or there is a lot of noise in the office. I find I have to go outside for awhile, get some fresh air then return. Through where I am working I have beenseeing a Trauma Counselor, and at my next appointment with her this is something I am going to really go in depth with her about. I happened to mention at work yesterday how I cannot even listen to music these days, because it brings back bad memories of the past (I did not mention that, just said I cannot cope with noise) and of course no-one understood this. How can any human being say I do not like music etc. ?? But this is part of my past which I am slowly trying to deal with. When I began this volunteer job 4 months ago, it meant there I was now going to be around people, something else that was new for me. I had not worked for a few years, and now here I was with a group of people and I had to learn the art of conversation again, but at the same time, I was able to use skills I had to use for a long time (typing etc.) which I love. Fear if failure is something I am also trying to deal with, plus lots of other fears, which I will not go into. But as this post is about Feeling Over-Whelmed, I guess I have now put this down in writing and that is good for me. Thank you for letting me post in here.

PTSD-1955,Family member inadvertently triggering PTSD episode (possible trigger warning),"Hi all, joined tonight to ask for some guidance. I've bee mostly able to avoid what I suppose is a trigger to a sexual assault I experienced about fifteen years ago. The sound of someone smacking their wet lips/eating food with their mouth open sends me back to the painful experience. I have shared it with two female friends and with my family. The odd moment of enthusiastic eating will just stop me, I feel kind of locked in my body for a second and it might just turn me off my food. If it's continuous, I lock in completely and start having a very internalised panic attack. And when I can move, I gather myself and I withdraw. About three years ago, my mature father (heading towards his elderly years) began smacking all his food very loudly. As a family, we all joked at his rude table manners. It abated. He now doesn't care, and eats with noisy abandon. After a while of avoiding meals together I picked a quiet time to ask if his half denture was giving him trouble, or if he needed a new pair. He said they were fine, he was just old and didn't care any more about table manners. I politely reminded him that I am actually triggered by his enthusiastic eating, and if he could just close his mouth while eating I'd appreciate it. He still doesn't. He might try for a minute, but that's about it. So much of our family time is based around food. I'm a chef, we have always all loved to eat together, but I keep having to withdraw. When I'm triggered, I either slink away from the table which looks rude, or if I explain why I'm leaving, he expresses guilt and shame. I feel guilt at asking him to curtail, his eating pleasure, even though it was him and my mum that taught us how very rude it was to eat with your mouth open. So. I feel stuck. I'm frustrated I have to both constantly ask him to be considerate and that I have to ask him to alter his behaviour. I know he hates 'being associated' with my assault experience, though clearly not enough to alter his behaviour. Any guidance or similar experience where a loved one is actually triggering you?",girlleastlikely,Community Member,01-07-2016,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/family-member-inadvertently-triggering-ptsd-episode-possible/td-p/261015

PTSD-1957,Daughter and PTSD,"Hi everyone, I am a mum trying to support my young adult daughter who had an unfortunate experience with a client threatening to kill her and a fellow co-worker. This chap was very violent in his words and coming down off Meth. My daughter has since had to go on Workers Comp and formally been diagnosed as having PTSD by two (2) Psychologists and due to an non-supportive employer who after several previous incidences didn't implement any changes to the office environment which could've prevented further issues. The Insurance company is now trying to push my daughter back into the workforce despite her continuing to have night terrors, anxiety and a real fear for her life in a mid size town. She is now on anti-depressants and won't go anywhere without someone close by. She has fortnightly psychology sessions and visits her GP fortnightly. The insurance company are now requesting to be present at the next GP session to discuss going back to work which I believe is not appropriate. Her partner and I are trying our best to support her however as we aren't mental health workers it's hard to know what is right and what isn't. The employer has made no contact with her since the incident not even to see how she is travelling and there are currently 5 other staff members on workers comp for similar incidences. I would really appreciate any words of wisdom or advise as to how we can deal with the pushy insurance company and also does anyone happen to know of any forward thinking ideas that myself and her partner could use to support her more? We think it is way too soon for my daughter to consider going back to any form of employment atleast until she can actually leave the house by herself and venture out to the shops which currently is a major block.

PTSD-1959,UPDATE: Opinions on whether this is emotional abuse,"Hi there.First post, i'm looking for opinions/advice on whether my boyfriend's behavior is emotionally abusive.Full disclosure: I've been in a previous emotionally abusive relationship and quite recently I kissed a stranger at a bar, after a number of unpleasant events with my boyfriend - immediately fessed up, hasn't happened before or since.Prior to the infidelity, he:- walked out midway through a dinner after I refused to move in (approx 6 months in) and wouldn't talk to me for a week.- is extremely critical of how I do things around the house (cleaning, cooking etc) and regularly brings this up as a joke in front of my and his friends- often does things that physically hurt me as a joke- has significant road rage, chasing down cars that have cut him off, screaming EXTREME profanities. If I say this frightens me he will refuse to talk to me and/or frequently glare at me.- blames me for minor things that occur. On a holiday we had to walk from a ferry to our hire car and we ran into a wall that blocked us off. Threw the bag and swore at me-often suggests I look chubby or I smell as a joke- gets extremely angry if I dress ""too nicely"" because of how it makes him ""look stupid"" and questions why i've done it.After the inifidelity now, he:- gets angry when I drink or go out with platonic male friends. Says he is never going to tell me ""what to do"" but then tells me that i'll only embarrass myself or hurt him so I may as well not do it/he doesn't like it.- tells me I am ""too fragile"" to handle basic life tasks without ""having a breakdown""- constantly brings up the infidelity - usually in the middle of the night, he wakes me up - and tells me he's anxious and angry, but when I suggest solutions (counsellors etc), he tells me there's no point because i'm the cause of his problems anyway.These are all examples, though there is more. These normally happen once every three or four days, and afterwards he's extremely loving, caring, and tells me how good he is for 'looking after me'.Also as a side note, I have anxiety, depression and ocd.Just wanted some opinions.

PTSD-1960,Where do i start first? Worried partner. (trigger warning: family violence),"I've been with my partner for 9 years now and we have two small children. I noticed after about a year that he had a hard time dealing with us going out together, the night would always end up with him in a punch up with random people that he would encounter throughout the night. Him handling jealously sober was easy, he'd laugh or just give a evil eye and move on. I know it worried him, he's very possessive of me and our children but he could control himself. Fast forward a few years now and we have one child, almost 2 and I'm pregnant with another. We go to one of our good friends Daughters Birthday parties, yet again he spends most of the day drinking beer. It's getting late, I'm tired and I'm loaded up with a pram, nappy bag etc etc and I stumble and yell out to him to help me. It was like I just asked him to sacrifice himself on a cross. He exploded, he was screaming at me all these horrible things, not making any sense. Our friends got in between us and tried to calm him down, so he turned on them. Threating to kill them, he got into some horrible details about how he would kill both them and me. I jumped in the car with my child, he approached the car, so I locked the doors he punched the windscreen and once he moved I took off. Now that was about 3 years into our relationship, and he probably has incidents very similar to this about 5 times a year. Sometimes involving me, other times I don't even have to be around for him to start. I believe he has suffered with anxiety most of his life, but as time is going on I believe depression has snuck in there and a good friend who is in the medical field believes he shows signs of Bipolar 2. I could write a book with the amount of crazy stories I have involving chainsaws and all sorts of other things. When he gets manic, his eyes glaze over and it's like he is dead inside, like he can't even see me or whoever is at the end of his pointing finger. When he drinks, which he uses it to self medicate, he scares me. Sober, I've never been afraid of him. Long story short, I need to know what's next? I wrote him a 3 page letter to him last night, he responded this morning & finally admitted that he has a problem.. But what is the first step he should take. Local GP? and should I help him, or let him do it himself?. Most of my friends don't think he's is capable of change. But I'm not ready to give up on him, he is the father to my Children.

PTSD-1966,Going back to the place,"I try to avoid it but most of the depression and anxiety are related to a traumatic thing that happened as a teenager. The place it happened is in a park near some train lines. The trouble with that spot is that it can't be avoided. Particularly as I haven't told most people close to me that it happened, so to say anything is to let out something I don't want them to know. Moving interstate didn't get me far enough away as mother has moved to a house where when I stay there is a view from the bedroom window in the direction of that place. I can hear the trains passing which can make for bad dreams. Last time I was there I went past on the way to the station and saw there were some diggers making a hole for the NBN. I thought, at last it is being destroyed. But it hasn't. This week back here interstate the diggers are working on the NBN, it is triggering the memories, I am right there again seeing what I saw, feeling it, the smell, everything. I am beginning to think that I don't much want super fast broadband. I certainly don't want a trigger to follow me all the way back here. One psychologist told me to make it just another part of the landscape and not to let it have that power. I think I have done fairly well at that over the last 20 years, but then I seem to be developing quite a strong reaction to diggers and NBN equipment.",Gruffudd,Blue Voices Member,20-05-2016,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/going-back-to-the-place/td-p/179737

C) same child has diagnosed behavioural issues and can be extremely challenging. Add in two massively traumatic life experiences and it is very hard to watch this child suffering. d) 3rd child is experiencing behavioural issues too e) I feel unappreciated and not respected by my kids and sometimes hubby also. F) I feel like I am always doing things or trying to please everyone else. I have not enough time or energy to do everything and no part of my individual person left g) financial issues. Not on struggle street but huge amounts of debt thanks to custody court etc and means working 4 days a week and hubby working a lot of hours. Putting off plans such as buying a home, having another child etc h) really wanting another baby but knowing it is not going to happen due to cost and situation and other existing children's special needs i) thinking my relationship is the only good thing going for me for my hubby to turn around and say we are suffering because of my low moods and decreased libido and basically saying that he can't do it much longer j) my mother burdening me with her secret about childhood abuse by a family member and expecting me to not tell anyone in the family because she dealt with it by sweeping it under the rug. And then having my extended family basically disown me because she has told them I've kept the kids away from her. K) my in laws lack of love for 3rd child (not hubbys bio kid). They make it reasonably obvious 3rd child is different to the others. And 3rd child's bio parent brainwashing to think that in laws aren't allowed to be called family. i think that covers the most of it. But mostly I am just exhausted physically and mentally.

PTSD-1968,Blocked Memories of Abuse,"Hi, I am new to BB and have been struggling with mental illness for as long as I can remember. I saw a psychologist two years ago when I got to a very low point. During these sessions, we spoke about sexual abuse when I was a child. I was abused by two separate 'family' members. one from when I was very little. I have never told any other person about this. Though I can not remember a lot of my child hood, from what I can remember, what my sister remembers and one offending family members path in life, the psychologist has said that she believes that my brain has not been able to deal with the trauma as a child and has blocked details to protect myself. After having meetings with her, I remembered more details, but still don't know what happened to me. I don't know what is worse, thinking about it and not knowing, or if I should seek help to unlock these memories. Has anyone else had blocked memories?? I had been going okay but the last few weeks I have completely lost my way again, I am so sad all the time, I can't sleep but am soo tired and I feel like crying at nothing. I have never told anyone apart from psychologist about the abuse, because I feel like I should be protecting everyone else. If I told my husband every time he went to touch me he would think of it, and I don't know how he would react to my family if I told him who it was. I cant talk to my mother, I have never been able to really speak to her about personal things. And I cant bring myself to tell my best friend who I love to bits because I don't want to burden her.

PTSD-1969,Have You Ever Felt Like You Were Beginning To Lose Yourself? This Is My Struggle With Anxiety & Depression.,"I am 28 years old and I have always been a bright and happy person who loves life and has big dreams. I have a beautiful family, gorgeous friends, a wonderful job at a hospital working with lovely people, and I have a big passion for music, singing, and dancing.Four years ago I was asked out on a date which I said yes to, and when I met up with this person for our date It wasn't until they got into my car that I realised that they were intoxicated. I was scared and I didn't want to make a scene so I tried to pretend that everything was ok and did my absolute best to maintain friendly conversation with him. As time went on in our date I told him I wasn't feeling well and that I needed to go home and he was totally fine with it, but as I got closer to the destination of where I was dropping him off his personality instantly changed.I ended up in hospital overnight as I had been assaulted so badly, and I found out from the police that the man that did this to me was found and instantly sent straight to jail for 3 months due to his extensive criminal history...which I had no idea about.I was so upset with myself, I was devastated in my poor judgement not knowing how dangerous this person was, and I was so scared about breaking this news about what this person had done to me..I felt like a disgrace.After this incident I began to get really bad anxiety which I tried to seek help for by talking to councillors but I felt like nothing was working. I tried very hard for the next few years to manage this on my own but in the last 12 months I have started to feel very dark, empty, numb, extremely sad, and feeling like Im losing myself. After seeking help from my GP I have been diagnosed with moderate to severe anxiety and depression, and I am now on medication for both, and I have made an appointment to see a Psychologist.My mum who is very supportive told me to look at the Beyond Blue website, and I thought I would share my story with you all.

No one is abusing me now, but my mindset is still that of a victim and ive only just consciously realised this is happening and might be the stumbling block to making further progress with my anxiety and depression",danger_mouse,Community Member,06-04-2015,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/struggling-with-past-domestic-abuse/td-p/140607
PTSD-1973,Stuck in limbo after 7 years of domestic violence and emotional abuse,"Hi everyone, bear with me this is a going to be a long drawn out thread but i just need to get this off my chest and hopefully get some guidance with how to push through.I married my high school sweetheart 7 years ago we have two kids 6 and 4, soon after our marriage my husband started drinking heavily he would become mean and verbally abuse me, he would tell me i was worthless and so lucky to have him because no one else would want me which was a huge blow considering i already have very low self esteem and lack self confidence from my childhood where my dad would verbally abuse my mum and me.His drinking led to drug and steroid abuse and the verbal abuse turned physical. Around 5 years ago my anxiety and depression became so overwhelming i could no longer leave the house i had to rely on my mum to do my groceries and take my kids to school and after school activities. My husband would disappear every weekend on drug binges and return home angry and abusive. He has physically harmed me including in front of our children and smash the house up. I never had the courage to leave him. I needed him just like he would always say i did. My self esteem relied on him returning after his weekend binges even if he was abusive i would say to myself maybe im not so bad if he comes back to me. Its classic codependency i know but i felt of him as my lifeline.I suspected for years that he was unfaithful, we would fight about it to no end. I never found anything i just always had a feeling. He would shout and throw me around calling me insecure and crazy and i believed him. I honestly believed it was all in my head and all my fault. I blamed my depression for the way he treated me and two years ago i tried to take my life. I was sitting in the hospital bed feeling worthless and stupid and my husband came in crying apologizing and promising this was the wake up call he needed because he couldnt lose me.Surprise it wasnt. For either of us. His drinking and drug use worsened as did my depression.Just after christmas last year i finally had the courage to call the police when he escalated the violence against me, he was arrested, charged and an avo was placed stating he wasnt allowed at our home, to contact me, or see our kids. He breached the avo three times and is now he is in jail. I found out he was cheating on me every opportunity that he got. I feel like everything he is ever said is right i am worthless. I cant function now. I need help",brokenwings88,Community Member,30-04-2016,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/stuck-in-limbo-after-7-years-of-domestic-violence-and-emotional/td-p/128877

PTSD-1975,30 years and I finally told someone about my sexual abuse,"I'm 42 and 30 years after I started being sexually Abused I finally told someone, my wife after being together for 19 years. For the last 2 years I have been getting flashbacks, this has caused major relationship issues, trying to block it out of my mind, this has caused my labidobto to basically disappear, I have neglected my wife's needs for intimacy, being caring, support for her needs. We have been so close numerous times to splitting for good, I've had thoughts of ending it all. I've been to doctors, psychologists and Havnt been truthfully and told them what happened to me as a child, I didn't think it mattered, I thought I deserved what happened to me, I was the fat kid without many friends and who would believe me? The pain, anxiety the feelings of anger and disgust are haunting me, I've tried to keep it together for so long which has caused more problems, my wife has asked if I have had an affair with men or women, I haven't! I went to see a doctor today with my wife, he has referred me to a psychologist, I have been taking anti depressants for over a year and they have made me worse, I've cried when my wife has asked me why I don't do anything for her, why do I treat her like shit all the time (I'm not abusive or violent) I don't take her anywhere or do nice things for her, but I do things for the very few friends I have and I don't have an answer for why I didn't thus.

PTSD-1976,PTSD after traumatic birth and newborn with serious illness,"My son was born in April 2015 and it was traumatic. I had a healthy pregnancy but it all went wrong when he was born. He was born at 37 weeks but had stopped growing as my placenta had stopped working so he was more like a 33 weeker. The birth was 36 hours, and I ended up having an assisted delivery and epidural which wasn't what I wanted. I never had time to think about this as soon after he was born he was taken to the nursery because he wasn't breathing and he then had to be resuscitated. He was moved to another hospital with higher level care, but then moved again after another 48 hours ending up in the NICU. He was intubated and it took him about 6 days to breath alone which is unusual for a baby of that gestation.We finally got him home after four weeks and at first I felt so happy but then after another month he started experiencing reflux and no one would listen to me about it. Eventually a paediatrician did and since then (8 months ago) it's been a rollercoaster of him improving a bit and then regressing again. I get very little sleep, he's up 5 times a night generally between 9pm and 6.30am. Hubby helps but as I'm still feeding him, I naturally have to do more.I'm seeing a psychologist for the anxiety and PTSD.

PTSD-1977,Fruitless search for hope,"Hello and thanks for reading. I am 30-something and within the last five years I've experienced some immediate stressors - professional bullying, end of an emotionally abusive relationship and had trust seriously abused by trusted ones that have cost me considerable sums of money. Within this time I have also (finally) had some revelations about my past about events I had always explained as my fault, including multiple instances of sexual abuse when I was a child, by relative strangers and also a ""father-figure"". It came to light that my mother was aware of the grooming and failed to act.My father was similarly ineffectual in protecting me. More recently, I had a miscarriage which, despite being over-joyed at the news of my pregnancy, was met with apathy by both of my parents. Not even a follow-up text if I was okay weeks later. I finally put this to my mother and now she has rescinded contact. I am at my end. I spend my days trying not to drink and watching shows on my laptop. If I'm being ""good"" I will delay my first drink until 5pm and then I will drink to oblivion. I leave the house only when I need more alcohol. I had an eating disorder for over ten years (I've always been a total mess!) which I managed to overcome on my own. I had one visit with a psychologist many years ago to help me with this but he spent most of the first (and last) session asking about my sex life. My mother is a mental health worker and volunteered with LifeLine call centres for years, so I don't trust the avenues that are meant to help. I have retreated into a bubble and am terrified of coming out. Every time I try and emerge, something else seems to jump up and slap me in the face. I haven't even started on my intense dismay at the state of the world! I feel as though there is nothing anyone can do or say to help me regain my happiness. The anti-depressants helped for a while but now they just stave off the incessant tears. I have always been ""the strong one"" but I don't have the strength anymore.

PTSD-1978,sexual assault/rape survivor PTSD & anxiety i am seeking support,"21 years old & terified about what the future holds for me.In 2012 on the 6th of July I was walking down my street around 7:30am. I could sense I was being followed but could not see anyone. I was punched twice in the back of the head, as i fell forward someone caught me from behind with their large hand covering my mouth. (I will not go into detail as to what then occurred but i was sexually assaulted) Police were called which i almost feel made it even more traumatic as i was in shock and being asked to provide very intimate details. For the next year i experienced flashbacks, severe depression, severe anxiety and bad dreams. I kept this my secret as i could not burden my family with something i still didnt understand. My partner was my main support. I eventually exploded and decided to see a psychologist. I remeber feeling soo ill, my partner drove me and came to the initial appt. Every appointment was exhausting, an emotional battle. I would debate whether going would help or make the pain worse. I figured i had suffered enough and accepted that it was goung to be an emotional rollercoaster and that i needed help. After several sessions the flashbacks and bad dreams were getting worse. My bad dreams of that day were being incorporated into another dream. I kept having this same dream for a couple of weeks. I told my psychologist that it was all getting too much but she encouraged me to keep up appointments as i had come so far. In December 2012 i went to work just like any other day and experienced such an intense flashback my body went into shock and i collapsed. I struggled to comprehend what day, year or where i was. My boss assured me i was in a safe place and sat wiith me until it was over. My flashback was not from my assault in July but was from when i was 17 still in high school. I explained this to my psychologist as i was so confused and scared at the fact that how can something like this happen and i have no recollection of it?! She explained that the mind tends to block things out when it goes into shock and can not process a traumatic event. I had one more appointment with her after that and then never saw her again. I was not ready to go on another emotional rollercoaster. I am still suffering, i feel dirty all the time, i have trouble being intimate, i fear what the future holds, fear of men and crowded places. I just need to know that i am not alone.",Spencerr,Community Member,03-01-2016,PTSD and trauma,30,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/sexual-assault-rape-survivor-ptsd-anxiety-i-am-seeking-support/td-p/135327
PTSD-1979,PTSD/Flashbacks after partner's near fatal accident,"In November last year my fiance was involved in a motorcycle accident and broke both of his elbows and wrists (his right elbow may be limited for the rest of his life due to the extent of the injuries), had a frontal lobe injury with blood on the brain, blood in his lungs and a few other things. He spent two days in ICU with a tube down his throat and when he woke up in ICU he was barely coherent and in so much pain. He then spent another week in the ICU/HDU before being moved to an orthopaedic ward and having multiple surgeries. When he was in the ICU, I didn't know if he would even remember or be able to say my name when he woke up. He also broke his C7 spine and was close to being paralyzed. I have been struggling with a few things since then. I get EXTREMELY anxious and panicked when he doesnt respond to my text and calls, have constant memories and flashbacks of what he looked like in the ICU and hospital, and constant thoughts about what might happen to him in the future and what I would do if anything was to transpire. I cannot switch these thoughts off no matter how hard I try. We also lost our cat early this year to a car, and I have overlapping memories of his crushed face too, which then turn into memories of what state my partner must have been in/looked like directly after his accident (I was not on the scene but he was very injured). I also constantly think about what it must have been like for him for the last 6 months as he has dealt with so much pain, suffering and disappointment. He is also struggling with extreme depression and suicidal thoughts which I have to help him through too. I feel clingy because I now constantly have to talk to my partner when I am away from him so that I know he is still alive. 50% of the time it's not because I miss him, or want to talk to him, I literally need to make sure he is still alive. These thoughts have been invading my head for months now. I already have GAD which I thought was bad previous to this, but now I experience anxiety like I never have before and have started having small panic attacks which are new too. I guess I'm just looking to talk to some people who understand what going through something like this does to you both mentally and physically. I feel like I've only brushed over the depth of this but it's overwhelming to even write about.",cherrycola,Community Member,22-04-2016,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-flashbacks-after-partner-s-near-fatal-accident/td-p/121586
PTSD-1980,Bullying at school can affect your entire life.,"I was bullied at school not only by the kids but one real mean teacher. I kept it quiet from family because I didn't want to appear weak. The trauma created by Bullying at school can affect your entire life. I grew up not trusting anybody and had a fear of trying anything new in case people made fun of me. I still have very little faith in myself and my abilities and my self esteem is very low. I have auditory processing disorder which makes it very hard to focus and learn. Having this disorder at school, along with the stress of being bullied it became incredibly difficult to learn resulting in people labelling me dumb. I have 2 young sons now and get very defensive if they are bullied. Thankfully it hasn't been as bad for them. I do however have a niece who is very sensitive and was bullied for most her school years. She also doubts her abilities, has low self esteem and when she was around 10 developed obsessive compulsive disorder. There are a lot of schools out there that just are not doing enough to stop this. There were some incidents with my niece that should have resulted in the bullies being expelled from the school. Instead they were simply told not to do it again. My son had trouble at the same school. I told his teacher twice that a certain boy was being nasty to him. She did nothing a couple of weeks later the same boy was given an award for being considerate to others (even though he was still being nasty to my son.) My son and niece soon left the school. I now believe the same school is down to less than half the students. One of my hobbies is to write and record my own music. Most of my songs contain a message.I'm not the greatest musician but I do want to get my message across and maybe help inspire victims of bullies.",nobully,Community Member,18-04-2016,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/bullying-at-school-can-affect-your-entire-life/td-p/109532
PTSD-1981,i know im shutting down again. i dont know what to do.,"Hi. Im 29 female. My life has been packed with major events most negative some positive but short lived. At the age of 5 my parents divorced and docs put me in foster care for 6 months (my mothers friends who were orginally looking after us belted me up. The school notified docs.) In this time my sister was at home with my mother. I returned home to who would soon become my step dad in the kitchen and our babysitter in the loungeroom. By age 6 i got first visitation with my father since the divorce. Things settled a bit from there. Age 17 xmas school holiday visiting dad. (He lived on acres in the country.) He went to the shop which was 2 hours away. And never returned. The police came to the house and announced he was in a fatal accident. The following day mum comes to get me. From here im never the same. I get back to school and the whole school knows. This was the first time i felt so numb, i didnt eat. I didnt talk. I wanted to be with him. I blamed myself as i was meant to be in the car too but took too long in the bathroom that day. By age 19 i meet a lovely guy at the dance club. We hit it off and are together 2.5 years. In this time we live together and get engaged. By age 22 we split. He stopped coming home. I chucked a sicky from work and went to his parents to find him with their neighbour, 6months after this my nan and pop pass away. Again im devistated and start believing i am cursed. I dedicate my time to work keeping the roof over my head and adopt a pup from the pound. Things go smooth again. 26 after 10years service at work im bullied so bad i attempt to finish myself but see my litte dog and i stop. From here im in house lockdown with family to rehab. I rehab and get a new job. New place and meet someone special. Now we have been together on n off 6 years. In that time i have been up and down. Cheated on n caught him but for some reason keep coming back. Sad part is we are living together now. And although he has changed alot and there are no others now. Im beginning to think its too late that im already too numb toward him after all this time, we live in seperate rooms. I started a new job 4 months ago. And im on workers comp for a shoulder injury and workplace descrimination. (Im the only female there). I feel myself cracking. The hopelessness and depression keep me awake at all hours. Im shutting down again Nothing no matter how hard ive faught or tried has ever panned out how ive hoped. I dont know wht my purpose is.

PTSD-1983,I keep losing time and dissociating and life just keeps throwing up one thing after another,"Hi, This is the first time I have gone onto a forum so feeling overwhelmed. I am struggling really badly right now as I got diagnosed almost 2 years ago with DID. Prior to this I had a diagnosis of Chronic PTSD but this all changed when I lost my 23 year old son 2 years ago. He needed to reach out for help and didn't know where to turn and now my whole life is upside down. It set off too many memories and I have been in and out of hospital for almost 2 years. I feel like nobody gets me, well guess in a way I got even understand what is going on in my own head apart from I keep losing time and dissociating and life just keeps throwing up one thing after another. Does anyone else have this diagnosis and i guess even if not going through severe depression and anxiety would be why many people are here. How can we change our thinking to be more positive when every day is such a struggle and there feels like there is no hope.

PTSD-1984,first post - childhood trauma,"I was just wondering if anyone here went through major traumatic events between two and three. Followed by everyone pretending things didn't happen. Because of this, I have never known about life without trauma. All my trauma memories are dreams. Sometimes, I can remember them through art I make. A lot of the times I experience trauma through the way I think, feel, see, and be. I am almost fifty and have made it through (luckily). Something will trigger me off and I will be unable to function, or think clearly, or know anything, really. I have learnt it is when the traumatised child inside comes out and wants to be recognised. I think it is pretty bad when your family blame you for acting like a traumatised person. To me, they were lying to me about who I am. I know they didn't know better, but I have to draw a line in the sand. Even now they don't want to know. If the outside world doesn't recognise, or believe you, how can you recognise, or believe yourself? I have had such a hard time finding a health professional who knows how to deal with someone with me. When their therapy doesn't work I feel like it is my fault. After seeing about eight or ten people I found a therapist who is ok, but even that person admitted knowing little about really young children, trauma and its effects. At least he believes me. My partner does too, but that's about it. I get so dysfunctional at times I can't navigate the world. It tires me out less nowadays because I don't fight it. I have to accept the inability to do much. Well I am trying to accept it. At times, I feel I am burden to my partner, but she is brilliant. Even so I hate it being dysfunctional, and then again knowing at those times I am honouring the near death experience scarred child within. My therapist says just go to bed. Sometimes I go down a hole like Alice in Wonderland, but it is an empty void. I say to my partner, can you come to bed and lie next to me because I'm scared, and she does and we lie there in silence and hold hands. There are no words to explain it. Sometimes I go so far deep down inside myself no one can reach me.

PTSD-1985,PTSD and Compensation; What is my worth?,"With ANZAC Day coming up, I'm reminded of how WW1 and the signing of the Armistice Treaty is a metaphor for the PTSD symptoms I've suffered from early childhood, but more-so of my worth and value. As we all know, the treaty was signed on November 11, 1918. (11:11) But few are aware of the process that took place afterwards. Representatives of allied nations gathered in a conference room to draw up a document outlining the Conditions of Peace. They spent many weeks debating compensation and aid to specific countries along with many other issues. But the main subject that couldn't be agreed upon was 'The Worth of a Soldiers Life'. After all issues were dealt with, how much compensation to pay the families of those lost in the war kept these representatives at a loss. Many gave up and the few that were left, tried desperately to sought out what a soldiers life was worth. Questions had to be answered; Rank Marriage status Gender (Nurses for instance) Were they an only son/child Age How many children did they have They eventually agreed on an amount (the same for everyone) and the process was done. That compensation was only for those killed. For the poor souls who survived the war, left to deal with PTSD and the affect it had on their families, there was little if any money. It seems ironic the term 'soldiers life' relates to their death and worth to those at home​. Those left behind alive also had a life torn from them. As a 'survivor' of sexual atrocities, physical trauma, physical and psychological abuse and extreme bullying in the workplace, I can say without hesitation, compensation isn't always available. But sometimes it is; only if I complain and follow it up. So what is my worth? What are the questions that need to be asked about my life and what I've lost; what could have been? Or is my value about something else? Is it what I'm worth to others or to myself or both? It felt good to write this. I'm embarking on legal action for compensation. These are some of the questions that need to be asked to identify the worth and value of my loss and what I was put through. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that I'm worth fighting for. I needed to realise that. Cheers...Dizzy xx",Just Sara,Champion Alumni,04-04-2016,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd-and-compensation-what-is-my-worth/td-p/151189

PTSD-1987,Fighting the feeling of being helpless,"Hello, I was wondering if someone has experience with this feeling or could share with me what they did. I have a history of childhood abuse and trauma and started treatment for all sorts of things a while ago, but only recently shared this part of my life that I buried deep inside. Most of my life I worked hard to get out of the victim role and I achieved a lot and built a family. Life has been crumbling for a while now and it is a regular fight with myself to do the things that are good for me (in the long run) - like going to the psych. I had a few very difficult weeks lately and a couple of days ago I realised that one of the things that makes me so angry is that I feel helpless again. I don't know why this is happening to me and why I feel the way I feel and I don't think people understand and really want to explain to me what's going on - or they don't know. I am desperate to find my strength again and be independent and confident in my decisions, I never wanted to feel like a victim again and I feel like that now, helpless and not knowing when it's going to end. I get angry that I'm dependent on mess to make me feel better - and that means I have to go to see someone for a script. My problem is that I start pushing people away when I feel that in my eyes they don't want to understand me or help me. I just feel like walking out the door and starting to run again.

PTSD-1988,PTSD,"Hey guys I haven't been able to post on here for ages. I've been running from myself so fast I couldn't handle this site at all. So the short version I've been dead (my psych calls it numb) since 1999. I experienced some serious hell while dead but my attitude was pretty much - well I'm already dead anyway (just waiting for my body to catch up). Then after a year of therapy, in October this year, like a miracle I woke up. I had a marvellous - very manic time, for a while. Then I started feeling. Not pretty!! Overwhelmed to the max! It's literally like everything that happened to me over all these years suddenly started hitting me or more aptly slamming into me. I ran and ran. Mainly by keeping myself very busy, especially trying to study. My PTSD has just slammed into me and given me a huge jolt. My brain literally doesn't work properly anymore. I've joked on here and with people in my life about my PTSD brain but I'd never actually accepted the reality of what that actually means. Right now I literally have blanks, I retain very little of what I read and remembering peoples names is now rare. Part of why I'm posting this is to try and accept this truth - Right now I probably can't study. As much as that upsets me what I find even harder to face is that the main reason for me having PTSD is long term constant trauma caused by one person - by not being able to study I can't help but feel as though she's still hurting me",amamas,Blue Voices Member,26-11-2013,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd/td-p/67489
PTSD-1989,"Abusive parents and their effect on us, their children","In my case I never saw the treatment of me by my mother as being abused.

It wasn’t until I became an adult, around 21yo that I realised this level of control will never end. My tolerance lasted till I was 54yo and then the relationship, well I terminated it. The last 6 years have been wonderful, there was no other way. So if a child feels so aggrieved by his/her parent that there is no other option but to disown there must be something serious that has been ongoing for a long time. The problem is, that the parent is often in denial, for “I’m the parent” attitude often prevails in their mind if they are a controller. Might is right! No it isn’t parent- RIGHT IS RIGHT.! Lets go back a few generations. Say 1900. This period might be your great grandfathers time as a toddler. My granddad was one year old then. Many parents had traditional methods of parenting. Physical slapping or forcing children to do things was the norm. Dad was the law and mum was his servant unless mum possessed some incredible ways of manipulation in order to get things done her way. And her safety wasn’t secure either in many cases. Now 116 years isn’t that long ago in generation periods. Just 3-4 generations. I’m mentioning this because if that old fashioned method of life behind close door was adopted by the tyrants child and the grandchild…you could well be the next child to be abused. The handing down of methods of bringing up a child hadn’t changed regardless of its unacceptability in the modern world. However, as adults of the modern world with these forms of control becoming unacceptable we know it is wrong and we rebel. I can recall when my kids were babies. We were told not to breast feed, what to feed them, that we weren’t good parents, that we should be living in a home of more quality standard, that I should work more hours and “get a better job”. These expectations were unsustainable. My tolerance was finite. When this happens it is abuse. It’s at least “stepping over the line”. For your own mental health and stability begin to set your boundaries. Be clear, direct, consistent, firm, fair and allow some time for it all to sink in. Then if all fails don’t feel guilty. You did your best with a parent that didn’t want limits to their control. You were a puppet seen no other way.

PTSD-1990,Not coping following traumatic 18 months. Not sure who can help.,"My husband suffered a severe headache Xmas 2014. He went to the Dr several times but was told it was stress & sent home with paracetamol. Late Xmas day I took him to hospital & he was in a helicopter to Sydney within an hour. He had a ruptured aneurysm & was close to death. We live 6 hours away so I raced home & grabbed my sons & we drove thru the night to Sydney. Early the next day he had surgery & with luck & a great surgeon he survived. We were told he was extremely fortunate not to have stroke like symptoms & we should not worry as the chance of recurrence was very small. All settled back down until June 2015. He had a routine scan to & we were told they had found 2 new aneurysms located in his brain. We were told all of the facts & had to decide. Surgery carried a risk of 40% death, 40% disability and 20% success. If he chose not to have surgery the risk of rupture started at 15% per year and increased approx 15% per year for the rest of his life. Because of our remote location & his previous problems rupture was likely fatal. Our son was getting married in August so we decided to consider all the info & make a decision after the wedding. Within a few days of deciding this my husband said he couldnt live with this hanging over him, he couldnt sleep & couldnt concentrate on anything else so we rang our neurosurgeon to book a surgery date as soon as possible after the wedding. We had a beautiful day celebrating our sons big day although everyone was acutely aware of the upcoming surgery. We both took 3 months leave from work and spent a fortnight at the coast together before the surgery. All the time anxious of what lay ahead. On November 8th 2015 my husband was led away to theatre and we waited. After about 5 hours we had a call to come to the ICU. The Drs were confident the aneurysms had been successfully treated. Now we just had to wait for him to wake up and see if his speech, sight etc was ok. Luckily everything was fine. He was discharged a few days later but I was hesitant to return home so far from hospital. Just as well as he had an allergic reaction to a medication and ended up back in hospital for 2 days. Now we are home and returning to 'normal' life but I just cant settle. I worry all the time, I cant eat or sleep. I cant concentrate at work, I cry a lot for no apparent reason. I know I should be happy everything is ok but I just cant and I dont know what to do or who to turn to. Thanks for listening to me rave on.",csm64,Community Member,17-03-2016,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/not-coping-following-traumatic-18-months-not-sure-who-can-help/td-p/121804
PTSD-1991,"Unemployed, homeless, violent background, feeling overwhelmed","hi a little about myself...l am bipolar 1, ptsd,personality disorders, anxious and possibly depressed, im also unemployed and have been homeless for nearly a year now...l have spent a lot of my life in & out of psychiatric units, sometimes against my will, l come from a violent upbringing & family so l got to watch a lot of my friends & family members die, often in tragic circumstances...l am a substance abuser,have been since l was twelve, often to cope with the violence at home...l am disconnected from my two children, friends(only 2 left), and family who no longer want to be a part of my life which l understand because l have caused a lot of pain, to them family and friends.. l am completely detached from society. My support network is gone & doctors have told me they no longer know how to help, im in the too hard basket & am not young anymore, im in my late 30's. You could say that l am currently overwhelmed and while a positive attitude is a must, especially when hardest hit, its becoming extremely difficult to initiate this positivity in my current climate. The question is, can one come back from so many obstacles & no support networks? ps because of my homelessness & never staying in the one place more than a day or so l am told that support services can only help me if l stay in the catchment areas...this is most times impossible to do due to safety concerns, police harrassment and fear of abuse. While l live by my motto NEVER EVER GIVE UP, l hope l can maintain hope...thats all l have left. thanks for allowing me to vent...best wishes and good health to all you members out there, hopefully a silver lining awaits us all",lector,Community Member,27-03-2016,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/unemployed-homeless-violent-background-feeling-overwhelmed/td-p/142572
PTSD-1992,Emotional abuse,"Hello, I'm new here so I apologise if I am posting the in the wrong section. I've been searching the Internet for help and advice and any information I can gather about emotional abuse and just generally need to get this out. ive been with my husband for 20 years so ther is a lot of back story but I will try to write the main points. My husband is a doctor, a specialist. I have always been the one to do all the initiating, if I don't touch him we don't touch, if I don't talk we remain silent. He has rejected me sexually in the past. He doesn't use my name he will just talk at me, he doesn't try to kiss or touch me, he doesn't recognise/talk about my achievements or accomplishments, he won't say happy birthday to me and if he does give me a card he won't write my name on it, it's like I don't have an identity. When I delivered our kids he wouldn't go to any antenatal or scan appointments and would not hug, kiss or congratulate me when I had the baby..I have had cancer and needed an excision, he complained to me that he needed to take an afternoon off work to allow this to happen. years later he mocked me about it. He's very cold and appears to be in control but is passive aggressive and will often agree to things only to later shout at me. recently, and getting to my question, for years I have taken care of the kids, no help, no family or babysitters. we have 6 kids And u am so busy that I needed to hire a babysitter for two 4 hr mornings per week to help me, not for me, for them. He has encouraged me to get a babysitter yet as soon as I hired her, he told me I am lazy and that I do nothing for the kids. I was hurt by this and asked him why he treats me the way he does and in the space of 15 minutes he told me in his 'I'm a doctor and your a nobody voice' : you have OCD (trust me I do not). you have narcissistic personality disorder, you're just trying to have a go at me, I can have you committed. if I say something he doesn't like, this is what I hear. He denies and deflects everything. As he is a doctor, he thinks he can push me around and label me with disorders. I can't speak or ask him anything about his behaviour toward me without being shouted at. I asked him to help the children pick up toys and he told me I have OCD. There is so much more than this but I can't write it all. I just need to know what other people think because I can't talk to anybody else about this and I'm starting to feel the west and tear of this. Thank you.",autumngreen,Community Member,21-03-2016,PTSD and trauma,14,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/emotional-abuse/td-p/124956

PTSD-1995,Fed up with being abused and threatened by my 16 year old son,"I am fed up and have had enough. My teenage son who is addicted to marijuana abuses me, threatens me and is so disrespectful everyday. It isn't just me he doesn't care who he does it to but I am the one that cops it the most. We have holes in almost every wall in our house from him, he has wrecked so much of our stuff, damaged our sheds and fences the list just goes on and on. Today he got so close to my face in a heated moment that his fringe was touching my forehead. He came so close to hitting me twice today. He sold my daughters tv today to buy his fix. I got the police out and again like every other time nothing happens. My marriage is suffering because of his behaviour, my eldest child has moved out because she no longer felt safe. We no longer feel safe. I have tried all sorts of counselling but he won't attend anything. He doesn't go to school, he doesn't work. I have got no idea what to do next as I am about to burst. We need serious urgent help but I have no idea. Would love him to go to one of those boot camps where they get there anger out and then chat it out and figure out what is wrong but again where do you start. Thepolice told me to kick him out. Where would he go? To be honest I don't care. I have lost all my motherly feelings for him he has just dragged me so far down that I don't care anymore..next time it happens which won't be far away he will hit me then the police will do something.

PTSD-1996,Approx 6mths ago diagnosed with chronic non-melancholic depression with severe PTSD.  Recent relapse with work hour reduction by employer.,"Hi, I've recently relapsed. Just after my employer reduced my work hours, about 6weeks ago. I'm a health professional, so the 'I should be able to get myself out of this' hangs over me every day. I have been in practice for 2 years and struggling to build my client base...every set back feels like it could end me. I think about quitting and going back to admin. I know what to do and have started, over the last 2 weeks, getting up at 6am, walking (started to jog) with my partner and dog. Eat nutritiously, trying to keep to low processed foods, low caffeine (trying to eliminate), low sugar, high vege, protein and fat content foods. Journalling, I see a psychologist every fortnight, talking mostly about how inept I feel at parenting and trying to build skills. I really am crap at parenting. I came from a dysfunctional broken family with lots of trauma, so that is all I have to go off re: skills. I try hard to right this, but I feel that my mental illness makes it so difficult, as I get really anxious. I really rarely enjoy it. So sad and I hope I haven't damaged my kids too much with all the flashbacks and yelling (part of the PTSD)...so much guilt there. It floors me when it happens. Like today, we were running late for school because my daughter couldn't find her hairbrush, so I yelled at her, that it's her fault I'll be late for work, told her I wanted to not be her parent anymore, that it's all too hard. Then I spent the drive to school crying and apologising to her. Drove back home and called into work sick to lay on the couch for the day. It sucks. I hate it and 2 psychologists have not yet been able to help me stop. Taking 5HTP has helped a little - my idea. I've run out, thinking, maybe I don't have to take it anymore...will order more now! See this forum helping already Had another setback a few months ago when I experienced abdominal pain and ended up with appendectomy...during 2 weeks recovery at home I felt suicidal. I hope to find support here, as I've got no real friends to turn too...their all to bloody busy with their families and I'm afraid I'll wear my little sister out, as she is the only one, apart from my partner (who doesn't 'get it') who I confide in. I confided in my best friend when I got my diagnosis, 6mths ago and she walked out on me...12 years of friendship and it was that easy for her to walk away! Hence why I find it really hard to trust others with my heart.",Noreen,Community Member,09-03-2016,PTSD and trauma,6,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/approx-6mths-ago-diagnosed-with-chronic-non-melancholic/td-p/102608
PTSD-1997,"Unhappy Relationship - Abuse (Physical, Mental, Emotional)","I am a 21 year old female who has very recently been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (prescribed medication - started medication in 01/03/2016) I have been in a relationship with my partner for 14 months. In February 2015 I fell pregnant to him, and in March 2015 I found out I had a miscarriage. After the miscarriage, my partner proposed to me; to which I said yes. Ever since then we have argued about anything and everything. To begin with it would just be yelling and screaming because we both have trust issues. Then it would turn into physical abuse (mainly on his behalf to begin with, but after a while of being hit around, I too would become quite violent) For the past three months our relationship has been VERY rocky and VERY abusive. I find it mainly due to financial issues (I work full time, he doesn't work at all due to a broken wrist) so I find myself taking care of a majority of food, bills, rent etc. When I approach him for assistance with something, whether it be money, housework, someone to talk to etc. he ignores me and doesn't give me the time of day, which is why my depression has become so bad. We call each other names, throw objects at each other, push, shove, hit and scratch, but lately I have found that I am the one who has a VERY short temper and I will tend to hit things around me instead of my partner (e.g doors, walls, windows) I do not have a very good relationship with my family, so due to this I feel as though my partner is the only person who I can run to, and he makes this known to me by saying things like 'You have no one else but me, don't f*ck around or I will leave you' He makes me feel as though I have something 'mentally wrong' with me, but I don't know what to do about it or who to talk to. I am terrified of losing the man that I love because of my temper and the fact that I feel as though I am unable to just sit and have a conversation with him without getting overly emotional or temperamental. I have been referred to a psychotherapist for further treatment, but I would like to know who I can speak to or what I can do in the meantime because I'm afraid if I don't do something soon; I will lose my job, my house and the man I love.

PTSD-1999,Learning to deal with trauma by finding positives in learning or growing afterwards,I am using this thread for my own benefit but would be glad of others input. Last time I saw my psychiatrist & discussing the negative impacts of several traumatic & bad experiences he asked me to come up with positives or things I've learnt from the experience. Following his suggestion I started writing down things each day and this helped me but once I stopped things went downhill so I thought I would try again using this thread. Hopefully it may inspire others to find some positives to help them deal with their own trauma. My idea is not about making the event itself positive with comments like 'at least you survived' because that doesn't help. Positives I can think of today are: By being poor due to losing everything in the bushfire I have learnt to manage money well & can save & go without to get what I really need. This was a benefit when my husband was out of work and now that we are on carers & disability pension Because of my low self esteem I compensated by working hard at school so I got good marks. Thjis meant I was able to focus on my studies and got a scholarship to study at uni. I missed having relatives in Australia so I really appreciated my family and went out of my way to stay close to my brother which meant my kids are now really close to their cousins & my brother has helped me a lot when needed.

PTSD-2000,"PTSD, abuse and family","My step dad was very abusive to me growing up and has caused me a lot of fear and trauma. Despite what he did to me, the rest of my family still talk to him. They also refuse to support me at all saying they don't want to get involved. Even when I went to the police about it, they all refused to back me up or make a statement. It hurts a lot. I often feel like they don't care about me. Sometimes they put me in danger too by telling him about my personal life or inviting us both to the same function. I don't want to be anywhere near him, I'm terrified of him, and even when I tell them this they get angry at me and call me paranoid. There have even been a few in my family that say it's my fault I got abused, saying I deserved it because I'm a trouble-maker. They spread horrible things behind my back, and make fun of me. When I go to see my family, or when they visit, they often isolate me and leave me out of conversations. They also bully me and treat me like I'm inferior to them. If I see them in public, they act ashamed of me, like they don't want to be seen with me. I've had a lot of fights with them, I keep asking them why they don't like me and why do they keep hurting me, but they just get angry and say they do love me and that I'm just being sensitive. They also say I'm angry and manipulative, and I admit, I do get angry, because they treat me awful. And I have manipulated situations because it was the only way I could be safe from my step dad. They would have put me in danger if I hadn't done something! I'm really tired of fighting with them, but I don't know what to do anymore. They won't respect my need to feel safe, and they won't show any kind of support for me. I've tried everything to work things out but no one will listen. They just see me as annoying and causing trouble. They don't care how much pain I'm in, or if they put me in harm's way. They just tell me it's not their problem and to not bother them with it. I feel so alone. I feel like they don't care at all for me, and would rather see me hurt again then try to support me. I love my family, but sometimes I think I'm better off without them. Is that awful? It's just I don't want to be afraid and isolated anymore. I feel like I'm being punished for standing up to the abuse. He's nice to everyone, but not me.

That was what a group of 20yo's decided was there target. ive woken up and opened my door to a situation that i can never forget. The front door was kicked in there were multiple assailants, one of which attacking my housemate with a metal bar in an attempt to get him to say the safe code. the others next to him with three more standing in the front verander I was in shock and my arrival in the situation made the attackers stop and stare at me in surprise...my mind was racing on how to deal with the problem..(at which point i was attacked with an engine block and lost conciseness for about 10 seconds).. i was left with sever facial swelling/ bruising, i was coughing up blood for a week and suffering a headache for almost a year straight. the hospital gave me some panadol forte and sent me packing after refusing to Xray my skull because the doctor claimed that there was nothing he could do even if it was fractured. This was after hours of waiting in the waiting and the doctors spent the whole time accusing both me and my housemate of doing it to each other, my job made me take 2 weeks off work unpaid because they didn't like the look of the swelling and bruising on my face and the cops accused me of selling amphetamines and spent more of there time saying that i couldn't call it a home invasion anymore that laws say it has to be called an aggravated burglary.

PTSD-2005,I have become a woman abuser!,"6 years ago I went through some traumatic times that I had no control over and it effected me greatly and I have never felt the same and became unsocial cutting off contact with most friends. I come from a violent upbringing. Over the years when very drunk I have had the occasional outbursts but never hurt anyone and generally was nice to everyone when drunk. The last 12 months has been hugely stressful. Small things have become big things and have just felt so angry on the inside and easily frustrated. I had a amazing woman who I became engaged to and was the rock in our relationship. Things got worse till in December after a music festival where I drank like an idiot I just lost it back at the hotel room for no reason and shoved her to the ground and swearing at her. We spoke the next day and she had said that in 2 years she never felt threatened and that I need help and if it ever happened again it was over. I agreed and saw a gp and explained my past and he said I was suffering from anxiety and depression and put me on medication which I felt good from after a week I thought everything was going to be ok from now on and it felt so good to love life again and have some patience. My fiancé also moved her and her daughters into our new house recently. Then it happened again 2 weeks ago, music festival, too much alcohol and I went to drive home!!! argued and I pulled over told her her to get out, took her bag, shoved her to the ground and threatened her.She has since moved out and in with her mum and says that even though she will love me forever we cant be together. We had a great relationship most of the time and I promise I do not get jealous, I support her friendships, I never try to control her and this should be the prime of our relationship after getting engaged in September and finally getting to live together. I have spent hours each day researching what I need to do. Most stories I read are about men who have always displayed some kind abuse by being controlling and verbally cruel etc. This just seems to have come out of nowhere. We have never even had a big argument just small rows that we talk about openly later. I now refuse to get drunk again and have cut back alcohol use dramatically because I wont choose alcohol over people I love. I am seeing a psychologist this week but hoping for any other advice or similar stories for a better understanding. If I sound like I'm making excuses etc then I'm open to a dose of reality.Matt",matt21,Community Member,03-02-2016,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-have-become-a-woman-abuser/td-p/154771

PTSD-2007,PTSD - The returned soldiers maledy in men and women of modern society,"Many people don't understand the concept of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and it's symptoms. It's not only experiencing trauma, it's the waiting and not knowing if it will happen again; waiting for the next bullet, bomb, enemy or orders to advance into a deathly situation. It's the waiting...to die or watch your mate perish. When veterans return home, peaceful existences don't make sense to the brain or biochemistry of the body, caused from living on adrenaline and cortisol for days, weeks or months at a time...hyper-vigilant with little sleep and rest. This same concept goes for civilians who've survived trauma. No matter what sex, age, race, religion or culture; waiting for bad things to happen again presents itself as anxiety, depression, panic, violence, victimisation and the list goes on. My PTSD story evolved from generations of abuse and dysfunctional parenting, and the secrets we/they kept. Unable to talk about it and even worse, seeing it as normal.

PTSD-2009,Police threatening abuse victims with jail :/,"I am a 32 year old survivor of child sexual abuse. The events took place across a period of around 6 months in the 1990's when I was 13-14, by a male school teacher. This teacher was removed from the school, and is married to one of the other students involved. There is 3 other victims, that I am aware of, 2 have taken their lives in the past several years. I'd managed to cope with it, mostly by shuttering it away. I'd had some counselling and AD's, but was mostly okay. Fast forward to ~2010, and this teacher is now the Deputy Mayor. I kid you not. I mention to the Mayor, who I had a relatively good relationship with, that this was causing harm to myself and other victims. Instead of getting support, I started getting legal threats. Constantly ever since. ""Speak up and you'll be put in jail"" I'm told, again and again and again. A week ago I called the Mayor, and told him I felt he should step down from his position. That it was causing emotional harm to victims, even if he did not mean for that outcome. So 6am this morning, two Police knock on my door and serve me with an AVO. Aren't police, who are aware the case is being investigated by several parties (including Police) supposed to be on our side? It's one thing to be getting threats from the teacher, and his friends - but when Police rock up and start carrying on about sending me to jail, it's a tough one to accept. I just don't feel like there's anyone you can turn to. Now that even the Police are helping intimidate me, I'm just lost. I am seeing a psycoligist (paid for by the education department) and getting AD's prescribed by my GP - but my goodness, I can see how people decide to take their own lives (something I'd never been able to get my head around many years ago - ""how could it be ""that"" bad I used to think!""",RickyK,Community Member,18-01-2016,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/police-threatening-abuse-victims-with-jail/td-p/125031
PTSD-2010,verbally abusive ex,"I was with my ex for 4 years, the start was fine, he was like any other guy but after the first year or so he started calling me names, it got worse as time went on, I guess he knew I wouldn't leave because he kept getting away with hurting me. He always made me feel like it was my fault whenever we would argue it was always over something pointless like cold coffee or burnt toast he would go off at me because I didn't make the coffee right. When he was mad he would call me a mutt, would swear at me, call me an idiot called me ugly once because he knew how I felt about myself. Would say ""no wonder you have no friends"" put down after put down and after hearing so much of it you begin to believe it's true, you feel worthless like you have no one. I had to start seeing a counsellor because I got depressed my doctor diagnosed me with mild depression and severe anxiety, he knew I had anxiety but would still try to make me feel like the worst person in the world whenever I didn't do something he wanted me to or didn't do something right. Almost into 4 years together I decided to leave I wasn't happy and had thought of leaving for a year it took alot for me to finally stand up for myself and leave. It's been about a month or so and he talks to me everyday says he'll change, asks for another chance asks to see me, when I don't feel IIke talking or don't reply or say no to seeing him the abuse starts and even threats. I've been sworn at, told to go die, I'm not aloud to return to collect the rest of my belongings if I do watch outhe I'm also heartless. He will abuse me over the phone and hang up then ring Back seconds later. I haven't changed my number because I wanted him to be able to talk to me I didn't want to hurt him anymore then I already did by leaving but I didn't expect this. I'm stuck. I just want to get the rest of my belongings change my number so I can move on but I don't think he is going to let me",stoneguzzi,Community Member,18-01-2016,PTSD and trauma,4,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/verbally-abusive-ex/td-p/103981
PTSD-2011,I often thought my first responder job would eventually cause me grief as has happened to many of my collegues,"30 years in a professional first responder role I would have thought whats occuring would have been a result of that and I was always vigalent for its signs but it didn't come from that. Always steadfast, reliable and confident in my job and nothing really fazed me and still doesn't. But the increasing fear, anxiety and total overwhelming panic I feel when my ex wife becomes violant or verbally abusive totally throws me as it is totally at odds with how I am professionally. I could never fathom it because I was looking in the wrong direction expecting that one car crash, suicide or god knows what else to tip me over the edge like so many of my colleges. I was looking in the wrong direction and after 15 years of emotional abuse and and at times physical abuse from my ex partner which is still occuring because we have three children the warning light has well and truly come on. Im a very capable guy, assertive in the most stressful situations, a returned service man there isn't much I haven't seen or done. But I could never disengage from the arguments and violant outbursts, she would just follow, there would always be some punitive response which was most likely involve the children and still is. It was always hanging over my head like a carrot I couldn't do anything and helplessly had to take it, it was always my fault. Still occuring but thankfully not as much as Ive been separated and now divorced for five years but have 10 years to go until I can finally be rid of my ex-wifes influence. I thought it was just accumulative stress which in a way is true but the reality is its PTSD and never thought for a minute it would come from this because I was being every so vigilant but looking in the wrong direction.",Pat101,Community Member,17-01-2016,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-often-thought-my-first-responder-job-would-eventually-cause-me/td-p/103251

My partner has just started a demanding job, my eldest is going to live overseas in 3 weeks. I am at the lowest i have ever been. It came to a head 1 month ago when my partner suggested that I need help as i have been flying off the handle a bit and not coping with the simpliest of things. I have seen my GP who said I' suffering from PTSD and extreme depression. I have been on anti depressants for a month. 2 days ago, my partner left the family home as he said i have been coming unbearable to live with. He still loves me and wants to work it out. I have been referred to a psychologist but that is not for another 2 weeks.

PTSD-2014,I guess this is my story.,"So, since my first post here actually helped me sort out a lot of feelings I decided to take it one step further and make a second post, describe my trauma, and what broke me down to what I am today.So here we go. I'm 22 years old, Male and suffering from heavy depression, anxiety, social anxiety, repressed memories causing cognitive slowing (the term used by my psychologist), Insomnia, psychosomatic pain when I try to recall memories of that time, all severe enough to cripple my function in daily life. So here we go, I was a very small child, and rather smart, as many know these are prime examples of being a target for bullies, and oh boy was that the case here. starting first grade, the standard bullying stuff, Name calling, social isolation/exclusion, nothing worth even reporting, but getting away with that much over a few years gives them confidence to escalate and as such the bullying became physical, Threats, shoving, hitting, I reported it but teachers only gave out light punishments, 1 time lunch detentions and such, which well... only annoyed them and made them go harder, so over the course of 3rd - 5th grade it escalated to full blown beatings, pelted with rocks, surrounded and tormented until I had a mental breakdown and just wound up screaming and flailing in pure terror, none of these one time events. 6th and 7th grades were the worst by far, developing into sexual harassment and eventually molestation and assault, Stripping me in front of girls on the playground, constantly touching me and grabbing me in sexual ways.. Not because they were gay, but purely because they knew I hated every second, and sadistically enjoyed my suffering. Something broke in me during all this, I've never been the same since, I doubt I will be ever again. The worst part about all this, is that these things are all I can remember, everything else has been lost into this cloudy void of pain and hatred. 8 years of school life, vanished, not a single memory left but abuse, pain and torment. I don't even know the correct medical term for whatever this is, something messed up I'm sure.So there you have it, the story of what happened to destroy this 22 year old to destroy him a point where functioning a normal everyday life is more difficult than directing a blindfolded toddler to completing a rubix cube. To answer any predicted questions, Yes I see a psychologist and psychiatrist regularly, no I don't really have anyone in my family or friends I can talk to.",LZinsight,Community Member,03-01-2016,PTSD and trauma,9,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-guess-this-is-my-story/td-p/135447
PTSD-2015,Feeling stupid & embarrassed re reaction to trigger,Attended meeting at church discussing scriptures. Unfortunately person leading group started using bushfires as an example to illustrate the point he was making. There was nothing wrong with what he said for anyone else and I could see the point he was making. I managed to stay where I was although uncomfortable for a short while but then further comments were too much and I walked out feeling embarrassed for making a fool of myself and extremely anxious and upset both due to what was said and then my over reaction to it. I was trapped in a bushfire as a child so reminders of bushfires is a trigger for me. One minute I think I'm doing better and then something like this happens and I feel like I'll never overcome the problem.

PTSD-2018,"Abused as child,  grief and alcohol - I'm OK","Brief outline of my journey: Was abused , sexually by my older sister's husband as a teenager as was my best friend, told my parents and they didn't want to make a fuss and still allowed him to come into the family home. When they divorced I was always looking out for any evidence that he was doing the same to their daughter. Told myself it was my fault for looking older than my years and he wouldn't do anything to his own child. Told myself that I was reading too far into things and they had a normal relationship. When she was 9 she told her mum that her dad had 'done things'to her since she was a toddler. Had to have examinations etc. I told my story to the police and made a statement - was handled really well and professionally. Years later as an adult she pressed charges and he's now in jail. Part of me thinks my sister knew what he was doing to me back then and we haven't been that close since then. I have also emigrated to Australia from UK 12 years ago so didn't have much contact anyway. My best friend who was also abused by him was found dead last year aged just 41 after fighting eating disorders, alcohol resulting in job loss and children being removed after her 2nd husband became abusive. We were always really close, like sisters despite living on opposite sides of the world. Saw the decline and tried to help her. Loved her so so much and think of her daily. I keep in touch with both her children. 1st husband and step-Mum to her daughter have been amazing. Side note my brother was in and out of prison all his life. Is a drug user, was used to him being arrested, bringing dealers round for money he owed and bring frightened in our own home. Face splashed all over the newspapers recently as one of the biggest drug busts in UK gang member. I chose around 13 years ago not to have any ties with him. I was aware of his domestic violence against women and right if this was someone doing this to my family, friend or colleague I would be advising them to get out of the relationship. Staying in touch would be condoning it. I actually believe I have turned out really well and have a gorgeous husband of 21 years and 2 over 18's children. We have our ups and downs and I strongly suspect (read know) that my husband drinks too much for his health.

PTSD-2020,Physical abuse as a child still affecting me,"Helloi just want to know if I should go and see a doctor about ""depression"" or ""anxiety"" or whatever I have. I've taken so many online surveys and been through thousands of forums and I'm still undecidedas a kid my parents split when I was 10, and that never had never been a problem for me, but should it have been? Then my mother found a new boyfriend and all was well until we moved in with him and when she wasn't at home he would yell and scream at me and my 3 sisters. I (being the only boy) was also physically abused.All of this went on behind my mothers back when she went to work and we never dared say anything in case he went off his trolley again. I believe my sister was sexually assaulted but I have never known the true story on that and I am afraid to ask her about it. My sisters and I all made a pact to never tell my mum about what had happened because she already suffers from depression and bipolar and to be honest it wouldn't resolve anything by telling her my mum and this man broke up after 5 years, but I had only been 16 by that time and very dark on the world. I tried to end my life many times as a teenager but I could never follow through with it. I then went to live with my dad and he's such a great guy and we discuss what happened every now and then and it helps but it doesn't fix what's wrong with me.this morning for example, I woke up happy as larry, got out of bed happy, made breakfast happily, and then out of the blue I collapse and have no energy to do anything. Why do I feel this way? I don't want to see a GP or anything, I just want to know why my moods are so up and down constantly. I also get angry but not in a normal way I don't think. I loose my mind and all I see is black and white. I feel like this has a connection to my childhood. Does anyone else feel this way? And what have you done to manage it?

PTSD-2021,I'm new and sick of suffering.,"I suffered horrendous trauma as a child due to having parents with untreated mental illness..so either genetics or brain development has left me with major depression .i must admit that taking medication has taken the edge from my deep and painful agitation but I still feel worthless and irrelevant and at 51 years I am tired of this battle.i have worked many years as a mental health nurse in an attempt to understand the mind, and how to manage mental illness. After my partner was gaoled for causing death when falling asleep at the wheel, and my next housemate died from a mixture of prescription drugs(& I inevitably found his body & attempted to resuscitate him to no avail)- I feel unable to heal. I have been praised for my resilience but how resilient can one be.?i keep going for my daughters but have no self worth. The world is full of money hungry people with no concern for those with mental disability. These money hungry people have the power and I am sick of being harrassed by a major bank when I am unable to work. They charge me fees for having no money and effectively discriminate against me for having an illness. And what can I do about it? Nothing!

I started exposure therapy for PTSD related to bushfires I was trapped in a bushfire which destroyed our house as a 10 year old, In those day I am supposed to read articles about bushfires each day as part of the exposure therapy which has brought everything to the surface combine as that with Christmas so I don't see my therapist for several weeks to debrief and we have hot weather with Total fire ban days and frequent reports on the radio re fires. As a child I was badly sunburnt several times. I was home from school with severe sunburn on the day of the fires so I am hypervigilent re sunburn risk ie won't go out in the sun without long sleeves & trousers or skirt Sunscreen isn't enough. Hence I cant relax at the beach or pool when it is hot. I used to enjoy swimming (in the shade or late in the day when the sun is going down but my husband is now blind so I have to watch him in the water constantly and give him directions which way to go. I used to work through summer but stopped work several months ago as it was too stressful as I was really stressed, a colleague didn't like me and often complained about me to my face and my husband kept getting sick so I was exhausted looking after him. He had surgery in July which was supossed to reduce the risk of him choking/aspirating but it failed and the tube was reiserted 5 times before we gave up and never wnt back to the hospital after the last time.

PTSD-2024,My wife is a sexual abuse survivor who I thought had moved on but has severely regressed after her abuser died recently (her grandfather) Please help?,"Hi All, My wife was sexually abused by her grandfather for many years as a pre-teen to mid teens. She prosecuted him at the age of 21 and he was jailed for 18 months. We've been together now for 23 years and after much therapy/counselling I thought she had moved on to a happier place in life. To cut a long story short, she maintained a basic relationship with him over the last 23 years ( visiting him e.t.c ) which I strongly disapproved of inwardly but showed her support on a basic level ( I refused to see or talk to him at all). Our marital/love life has always been very simple & plain once she met me ( before that she had many partners in a very short time ) After her abuser (Grandfather) passed away a few months ago, she has completely regressed and is having nightmares and avoids any intimacy with me whatsoever. I understand this is normal for some survivors but after a few months now , any physical intimacy ( even hugs) are avoided like the plague... Its like she has it in her head that she was still in a relationship with him and is grieving him like a wife who has lost her husband?? I'm completely isolated (because of my position in the community-I'm well known to everyone without giving anything away) There is no one I can talk to about this..... I'm feeling helpless to help her plus I'm struggling badly without any form of human intimacy. I've encouraged her to seek counselling/help again but she is refusing. She says she loves me but won't give me even a hug/cuddle anything.... Any advice on where to go from here? I'm having huge difficulties sleeping and struggling with many depressive thoughts.

PTSD-2026,my story of a traumatic childhood to where i am now,"i spent the first 15 years of my life being neglected and mentally + psychically abused by my drug addicted parents - not provided what i needed to attend school such as books and correct uniform, and had nothing to stay safe and warm and be loved like all children should be. i did my best to provide for my other siblings, i did my best thats all you can do as an 8, 9, 10 year old with no money or support from anybody. my parents only paid attention to us when they wanted something to hit and hurt. unfortunately my dad was worst for it and it happened every single night until i was 15. and it was much much more than just hitting, but i dont think i can go into detail here. i have scars and marks from these nights. this was usually when he was very drunk. i spent every single moment of my childhood terrified, lonely, feeling useless and feeling unloved. he manipulated and controlled me and my siblings. when i was 15 i spoke up about my home life, this was to a teacher at school after i showed up to school with a broken laptop that i had borrowed- it was used in the night befores proceedings....it took a lot for me to open up but it was the best thing i ever did. a while after that my brothers and sisters and i were put in foster care while mum and dad tried to sort out their issues, but that never happened they couldnt sort out their addictions and other problems out enough that it was safe for us. im 20 now and my younger siblings are still in care. my dad died last year and my mum is still using ice, cocaine, and some other drugs. i have been able to achieve something with my life and i am determined to be something and do something with my time in the world. i was constantly told i would end up being nothing in life, but look at me now - got a house of my own, got friends, a full time apprenticeship, play footy both for local and in a squad and I'm working on my mental health issues!

PTSD-2027,New Has anyone had treatment for PTSD for trauma experienced decades ago,Hi I have experienced depression & anxiety for years and sought medical help more recently as it escalated. I recently gave up work as it became too difficult to cope while caring for my husband whose medical condition has deteriorated recently. My psych recommended treatment for PTSD but I am now feeling more stressed & anxious as it is stirring up really bad memories and feelings. It also means there isn't time to focus on other things which are causing stress and increasing depression. I feel like there are are so many negative thoughts and feelings in my mind I am overwhelmed. The initial trauma occurred when I was 10 but there has been other experiences as an adult which had the potential to cause the same problem.

PTSD-2028,living next door to attacker,"In June this year, I was attacked by a neighbour while she was having a psychotic manic attack. It took months before I could go out of the house without panic, but I was recovering. Now my neighbour is back home and any progress I made is long gone. Although the house is on the market, in our neck of the woods it takes around two years to sell and nobody local will buy or recommend the house next door to the local lunatic. The stress is more than I can bear. Anybody have any suggestions, as every time I see her I'm right back trying to duck that hammer. PS I still have to go through the ordeal of going to court. That alone fills me with dread and I'm pretty sure the verdict will be not guilty by reason of insanity (the correct term escapes me at present) and she'll still be next door with her bedroom within 10 metres of mine.",Hoonlady,Community Member,07-12-2015,PTSD and trauma,5,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/living-next-door-to-attacker/td-p/149699
PTSD-2029,PTSD AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,"I'm not really sure where to start. Other than finally finishing in the family circuit being my undoing. Two nights ago I ended up in the hospital because everything finally hit me and became to much. I felt like I couldn't keep on going anymore. That my abuser (my sons father) and my narcissistic mother were right ""I'm just a piece of shit that no one likes"" the anxiety is crippling me, the night terrors keep me awake. The heightened response that one day he will make good on those threats. I'm in this wave of emotion of not wanting to be anywhere, I don't want to be at home but I don't want to be at work, I don't want to be outside but I don't want to be inside. I spent two years going to a domestic violence counsellor, six months with a sexual assault counsellor. And six sessions with a phycologists trying to manage the PTSD. I thought I was managing ok till family court came to and end after three years. I can't move past the hurt that was caused by my abuser or my own mother. I feel really isolated and don't know how to cope with being a single mother with a son with behavior issues trying to get help to only be told""you're doing everything we would tell you to do, so there's nothing else we can do to help"" trying to provide an income. All I have is my sister who lives in another town, and my best friend who even though has been in a domestic violence situation herself many years ago, does not comprehend the damage it has had on me mentally and believes I should just move on. But that's what Ive been told by many people that I just need to ""move on its in the past"" I really wish it was that easy. I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know how to get back up. I know my son needs me but I don't know how to stop feeling the way I do. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

PTSD-2030,Forgiving people,"Hi all, I'm new to Beyond Blue. I joined because I'm searching for answers, and I'm actually not allowed to discuss my issues with some people. Every time I bring it up they respond with ""Oh, Just let it Go!"" Approximately 10 years ago, I was sexually assaulted by someone I looked up to, trusted and cared about. I was an adult (just) so therefore was given the choice to take it to court or not. I was given the advice that I shouldn't by other people who I trusted (the same people who won't allow me to talk about things with them), and therefore although I had a rape-kit done, just in case I chose to go ahead with it, I never took it any further. For a few years now, I thought that I'd forgiven the person who hurt me. I didn't think about it, it didn't affect my daily life. Recently, however, due to knowing that I would soon be seeing that person at a function that I was attending (and since attending said function) I've felt much the same as I did in those first few days/weeks after it happened. It appears now that I wasn't over it, I'd just repressed it. I want to forgive that person (though I'm not ready to forgive those who don't want to hear about it). I know through my faith (I'm a Christian) that there are scriptures that tell us to forgive, and yet when I mention this to people or on the Internet, I get conflicting messages. Some people say that I should try to forgive, when I'm ready, because Jesus taught us to forgive, but other people tell me that I should not ever have to forgive that particular wrong. Without going into too much detail about Christian beliefs, I'm trying to find out whether or not I should be forgiving person as they have not yet apologised and asked for forgiveness, and if so, I want to know how I go about forgiving that person. Part of me thinks that I should forgive, because Jesus didn't say ""forgive everyone.... oh except for him!"" Please note, I am not asking for a religious debate, this is not the place, but I am wanting to know which choice to make, because I really do want to forgive them despite their lack of repentance, I also want to know how to forgive (which is strange because I'm generally quite a forgiving person by nature.

PTSD-2033,dealing with rape,"Hi all, I've just newly joined this website, to find a source of support in my life. i was raped over a year ago; i did the necessary steps reported it to the police, saw a counsellor, dr and psychologist. i took anti-depressants and sleeping pills this helped me gradually de-stress from the pain. my closest friends know and elder brother knows. the problem is that it has been more than over 10 months since the cops have contacted me. i purposely don't think about it or talk about it. i keep myself busy with studies or working. until recently i saw the after effects of it catching up on me. things like not being able to sleep, bad dreams, waking up 2/4 times in a night, unable to talk in public speaking, becoming extremely anxious... my main issue is that i don't have the courage to call the cops and close my case. i get frustrated quite easily, in previous calls I've called and they've made excuses which puts me off. I'm going on my first solo adventure in december... i want to be able to have this chapter of my life closed up mentally. i don't want to have to resort back to medication just to be able to sleep and function properly. does anybody have any coping mechanisms for my situation?

PTSD-2034,Second marriage breaking down due to emotionally abusive behaviours from husband,"I have been married for four years to the man who I thought was the love of my life. I have two daughters and my husband has four kids so there are six other people's lives affected by this unhappy marriage. My husband is an aggressive bullying and controlling person. He has a tendency to go from a ""normal"" mood to a spitting rage in mere moments and as a result of this we all walk around on eggshells most the time. No-one can predict him from hour to hour. He is a very difficult man to live with and has hugely affected my life not necessarily in a good way. We got married a year after my first marriage ended I felt at the time a bit hesitant about it all (we had a very expensive trip/wedding in the UK with all 8 of us) - I felt it was very rushed. Bit by bit after the wedding his angry episodes became more and more frequent - he would ""rage walk"" on the beach 2 or 3 times a mth - sometimes sleeping there overnight (something he also did in his previous relationship of 19 years). His kids were well used to this behaviour - my two girls (13 and 15). I believe I am an easy going person but I do admit I am hugely affected by his outbursts and and put downs. One night two years ago I asked him politely to bring the dog in as he was about to get into bed as she was barking. He went berserk - I was already in bed - he grabbed the covers at the end of the bed and tugged them off me then knelt over me and spat in my face saying ""Oh and YOU'RE SO PERFECT!!"" And then he spat in my face. I left the next morning and stayed with a friend taking the girls with me. He demanded I return by a certain time or not bother at all. Typical! I returned of course . About 2 mths ago he stood up in front of me and the children and when we were arguing he walked closer to me and when I put a chair between us he kicked it out of the way. The children were v frightened - his 16 yr old son asked him to please stop - it was a very charged situation. A week later I told him at family dinner that if he did that again I would leave and take my daughters with me. He says ""Cos it's ALL my fault"". When I say ""Yes, it is. I'm not the person losing it"" he says ""it's just one long list of what's wrong with ME"". My daughters do love him and he is not all bad. When this blind rage hits him it turns him into a very intimidating force (he's 6 ft tall and very strong). Any help or advice would be appreciated. How much of ourselves can we sacrifice when living with an emotional abuser?

PTSD-2035,"PTSD, Anxiety and OCD","I have recently been directed to his site by my psychologist. No doubt my story is old and tired, and experienced by many others here. But I will tell you my story anyway. I was raped almost 20 years go now. It was by someone I knew and trusted and it occurred in my own home. I was physically injured, concussed, ashamed, afraid, embarrassed - all the usual things. I never reported it to the authorities and never spoke to anyone about it. I had never been a particularly social person, but afterwards I isolated myself completely other than for work. After 18 years of almost constant battles with anxiety, flashbacks, nightmares, triggers, etc, I finally sought help from a psychologist. Initially it was for pain management as I suffered a severe back injury about 2 years after the rape. So after almost 2 years of occasional appointments I finally told her during a particularly difficult time (anniversary) what had happened all those years ago. I have now been diagnosed with PTSD. On her advice I have undergone a series of Exposure Therapy and CBT this year. This has helped to some degree. But I am still getting nightmares, anxiety symptoms, etc. This has probably been made worse recently as it has been a really lousy second half of the year for me. My little 11yo niece was killed in a car accident, I was retrenched from my job when the business was sold, and I found out that my husband was cheating on my again. So I guess none of that has helped. Anyway my psychologist wants to try EMDR treatment next year after things settle down a bit. But in the meantime she wants me to talk to people about what happened, as it is an important part of the recovery process she says. However that is really hard as I do not have any friends (my hubby is a narsissist according to my psychologist). I have become quite isolated other than for my part-time work, which I now no longer have. I do some volunteer work in the aged care industry, which I enjoy. But I just do not have any friends I am able to talk to. My family live a long way away, and I could never tell them anyway. Hence this option to try an online forum. I look forward to responses from other people who have had similar experiences to myself. I am more of a listener than a talker as complete strangers often approach me to tell me their problems. But I am unable to reciprocate. Although I am not able to talk about the rape, I can now write about it, & that's progress!

PTSD-2037,Post traumatic stress from MRSA,"I hope this helps someone out there! Ten years ago, after ongoing illness and my ex-GP's incompetence, I was diagnosed with a life threatening lung infection. This led to surgery in hospital , where I contracted and almost died from the superbug MRSA. This led to more surgery & a hospital stay of many months. At the time I had a young family & my husband did not cope well, trying to run the family business as well as seeing to the kids & my needs. My advise to anyone is: if you have any doubts about your doctor's advice, seek another opinion. When I returned home, I was still very ill & it took almost 12 months for me to be able to function almost normally. I have not returned to work & still monitor my health carefully, although over the last few years it's been easier and I'm classed as ""stable"", meaning my disease has not progressed. The stress from my illness has adversely affected my marriage and family and at dark times I wondered why I bothered to fight to live at all. It was my Specialist that insisted that I seek help for the PTSS which was impeding my recovery. He said that he wanted to see me stop crying & enjoy a full life. This was the best advice I have ever had! I was referred to a Psychologist, who I saw several times, I cried the full Ist session, weeped a bit in the 2nd & was quite upbeat at the 3rd. She gave me many strategies such as finding things to keep me busy. My new GP prescribed anti depressants which I disliked as I put on a lot of weight, but took these for 6 months. I continued to see the GP, and became involved in the kids school & sport organisations. However I found that these made me more stressed, due to the people involved. Once I distanced myself from these toxic people and found other interests, I have been much happier. I now realise that my illness will be with me for the rest of my life, but if I look after my health I can live a ""normal"" lifespan. Regular Specialist, Councillor & GP visits help. Selecting who I spend my time with , not being a ""people pleaser""(even if they are relatives) & deleting those negative people from social media is crucial. Finding creative activities and spending one-on-one time with each of the kids helps too. I have now embarked on study, with the purpose of securing a new career, to try & take some of the financial burden off hubby. Although I still have some down times, life is much better.",Mith,Community Member,09-11-2015,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/post-traumatic-stress-from-mrsa/td-p/104308
PTSD-2038,Can not trust enough to seek help,"I really need to find a way to build rapport or something with a therapist. I have been off and on over the years but I lie, freeze up refuse to engage and am so scared. I stay with them long enough for a diagnosis which I am never sure how they came up with considering I sit there on the edge of a seat ready to run giving surface meaningless answers to their questions. I am currently putting way too much on someone who is not even a friend just someone in the workplace. I am over sharing saying too much and have no idea why, why am I trusting and using this person it's wrong. Due to this situation were I am basically taking advantage of someone whom is too polite to walk away, I think I better try again with a psychologist. But how? They have these offices with chairs where I have to choose a chair that gives me an escape route (not always possible), they always try and use deep relaxation which panics me, they require me to talk about it but I really can't, who are they? I don't know them, do they believe me and why do they always try and force eye contact they must think ""get over it"" ""move on"" and for goodness sake why the creepy long pauses what do they want to hear? Oh and it's always a woman, yes I am aware of the fact that the ""trauma"" is male specific but I told women when it was actually happening and they told me to be a good girl. Then they/me decide it's weird I would want to talk to a man, so I always take their advice and see a female. yet on two occasions once a male psychiatrist the other a male social worker I told more to in the space of one session than several. I am at a point where I really need help processing the stuff coming up, I can't stop the images/feelings and I am scared I will get lost.

PTSD-2040,New to Beyond Blue,"I'm a 58yr old woman with physical disabilities and suffering from depression as well as anxiety. It all stemmed from my childhood after being sexually abused by a family member and having it swept under the carpet as was the way back then. My whole life has been 1 huge battle and I seem to be a target for everything to go wrong. I married, had 2 children, divorced due to post natal psychosis and have raised both kids on my own. My son left at 16yrs to find his way in the world and I haven't seen him since. My daughter, who I thought was my rock and saviour helped me through a tough time after an accident left me with severe spinal injuries. She married an alcoholic gambler and has 3 daughters, 1 I have never seen. In 2011 after my accident money came through I offered to buy a property with her and him as I knew she'd never have a home of her own. I'd already raised her 1st child from birth and now the 2nd while they worked. I had a lawyer draw up a Deed of Agreement (toilet paper) as I supplied all the equity, legal fees and paid for renovations so we had separate residences. They had a small mortgage to service. It's been 4yrs of hell, raising both girls all at my expense, while he drank himself into a stupor constantly, stopped paying the mortgage, home insurance, land rates and electricity etc. She threw him out constantly but always took him back. My beautiful property resembled the local tip and I fell further into depression and began having panic attacks. In March I confronted them and begged them to save my home but it fell on deaf ears. I withdrew my childcare as number 3 was due in September and I simply couldn't cope anymore. I was left to try to pay all the bills in the hope of keeping my property. In May they moved out and I was shocked to find their residence had missing walls, windows and dog turds everywhere. The bank then informed me I would be solely responsible for the mortgage as in their wisdom listed me as a borrower and not an owner as I was led to believe. They weren't interested in the damage, just when I was vacating so they could foreclose. They refuse to show me the loan application and say it was verbal only. It's now in the hands of the CIO and I'm sitting on a ticking time. I have no one, am housebound, about to lose everything and only have my depressing thoughts for company. Living in a small country town doesn't help. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

PTSD-2041,Abused as a child by older siblings possibly left me mentally traumatized,"I just realised that I've had a problem deep within me, I'm currently 20 years old. I started to be self aware at 18, because I left home for study on my own, since then I've been facing a lot of real life situation problems, work, social, interpersonal relationship, romance, financial, and stuff. I was doing all right, until I've had my first big breakdown, I left all 3 of my job, my academic record went downhill, relationship with my family gone worse from bad, and ultimately a girl left me. I'm totally depressed for good 6 months. At that time, I reflected all of my life, what went wrong. Then, my childhood memories struck me. I recalled all the nasty stuff what my brothers did to me when I was a child. We're 5&6 years apart, I'm the youngest of 3. I was overweight, they always called me fat. physically abused me, it still left a scars on my body. Once, they made me believe that our parents found me in the dumpster, and forced to raise me. Publicly humiliate me. I wrote a diary and love letter for a girl, they found it and tease me for years, yes years, I don't have enough space to spill it all here. Just to let you know what I've been through. I've always looked up to them, I wanted them to accept me so badly. I never really saw that as a kind of big deal when I was a kid, I cried almost everyday because of them, and yet I still desperately trying to get close to them. I never feel loved, nor accepted. They have outgrown their nasty habits now and trying to atone their doing, but I can't yet to trust them. Is there really any link between childhood trauma and the later on life?

PTSD-2043,"I've been seriously traumatized, differently to most","I have definitely experienced some quite extremely distressing, stressful and upsetting life experiences. Unfortunately I do not personally feel comfortable to ever discuss these experiences, I truly do not believe other people can under or relate, or at least the vast majority. Although I do believe people can relate to the general emotional and mental impact. I experienced a LARGE variety of emotions in relation to what happened, shock, acutely upset, deeply depressed, extremely angry, and for quite some time just an acute feelings of being stressed, serious problems sleeping, nightmares etc. I think to a reasonable degree, with a significant amount of time I have largely recovered from the above sort of impact. However there is absolutely no doubt that my experiences have permanently altered my perception of the world, in certain areas I am simply extremely distrustful, and I have become strongly unwilling to expose myself to situations where it could ever happen again. Without a doubt it has quite dramatically altered the course of my life in certain aspects. I have almost entirely battled with these experiences alone. I have had some quite harsh experiences in life. My mother died when I was 13, I have experienced extended periods of my life completely isolated from social supports and anyone who cares about me, I won't go into my life story, but the traumatic experiences I am talking about, nothing else in my life compares to how awful those experiences were to me. They will be in my mind, until the end of my life. I was WRONGED, quite seriously. Some people experience significant wrongs and get justice and recognition of what happened, in my case I never will. My capacity to be truly happy and content in life, without a doubt has been permanently diminished to some extent, but I am still grateful that I have my life, I know I have it a lot better than others. I am capable, and have reasonable physical health, I can have an acceptable life. I do emphasize with anyone that has experienced any sort of highly traumatic event in life, people who haven't been through it just don't understand.",HyperDave,Community Member,10-10-2015,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-ve-been-seriously-traumatized-differently-to-most/td-p/152741
PTSD-2044,Lack of care taken by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse,"Like a previous poster here I have been involved with giving evidence to the Royal Commission. After my experience I would urge all survivors of institutional abuse to think carefully about their health before they get involved. I have been more distressed in the past two months than any time in the last 20 years. The staff at the Commission have pressured me and overstepped my boundaries constantly. They do not offer any support that is safe or accessible to me. This is because the support agencies they have funded are very institutional and dis-empowering. This is very frightening for former wardies or homies. Most of the Commission staff treated me like I am worthless- they were rude and looked down on me. I have been retraumatised by sharing my story in an unsafe environment. I feel I have been treated like I was treated as child: like I have no rights and my feelings don't matter. It will take me a long time to recover. I am still crying every few hours and have been this way for weeks now. It is important that our stories of being abused in 'care' are heard, but at the moment the cost to our health is too high. Why can't Commission staff even be kind to us? They know we have been abused and we are crying but they don't care. I still can't quite believe how badly I have been treated by the Commission. It should have been an empowering experience but I feel like they see me like the perpetrators saw me: worthless, to be used and disposed of, powerless and rightless.",MsWharton,Community Member,06-09-2015,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/lack-of-care-taken-by-the-royal-commission-into-institutional/td-p/102799
PTSD-2045,Ex manipulated me into doing things against my morals,"I dont even know where to start.. or why im posting. In a nut shell, i was with a man 10 years my senior who can only be described as a narcassist. He manipulated me into participating in 3sums with other men on a number of times even though he knew i hated doing it. After everytime he would assure me we wouldn't do it again, but then a few months later he would push for it again. I was a prude if i didn't do it. The kicker was him manipulating me into one of these encounters when i was pregnant with our son. It was a horrible experience and i cringe even writing it on here. He was never physically abusive but he was verbally abusive and sexually. After 3 years we have finally split, its been 5 months and i currently have an intervention order on him, so I should be feeling really good right? NO, im not.. i feel anxious and are even self medicating. My moods are up and down, I feel anti social, my goals have been put aside. My questions, WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY? I should be HAPPY that chapter is over?

PTSD-2046,Lost,"Hello, I am hoping to find some advise - I am still very new to this all. I have started seeing a psychologist and I am just so unsure about what to do. I will talk to her as well when I see her - and that is part of the problem, the long gaps inbetween. I have various trauma and grief to go through from my early childhood until mid twenties. I have been able to live through this all and have a pretty happy life, but lately it seems crumbling and I feel disconnected from myself and from the outside. I have made the step to see someone but I am so scared to open the gates. Will I be able to cope and what strategies can I put in place to cope? The couple of times that we touched on certain subjects left me raw, insecure and exhausted. I cannot communicate the strength of feelings, being completely overwhelmed. It is so difficult for me and I am not sure what I want to do. What other options are there? Can it just be the wrong psychologist? Is it normal to feel lost and distressed when starting?

PTSD-2047,Confused and Uncertain,"I have spent 5 and a bit years struggling with PTSD, depression and anxiety. I have worked so hard climbing out of the deep dark hole I fell in to. Along the way I said hurtful things in anger, re-hashed my past over and over with one thing on my mind and that was to cause pain to the person who is responsible for my PTSD. I went to the police and made a statement and now regret it despite the fact I told the truth. It is my brother. But I cant take it back. I have dropped all charges but it has had its effect. As things got better and I have been able to come off so many medications I feel clearer, less angrier and with a desire to rebuild my life, despite everything I lost....career, husband, home, friendships and connections to my siblings. I thought as things got better for me so to would these relationships. I think I am wrong, I am still not positive this has happened, but I have tried to reach out to one brother and his family (not the abuser), so far all my calls and messages go unanswered. Its only been 4 attempts, but I am becoming paranoid and it is affecting my day to day thoughts. I am so scared I have lost them for good. There is so much I want to explain but feel like they just dont want to hear it, they are probably sick of my constant talking about myself. I am scared I have changed direction I was heading and that is my fight to rebuild my life. All because I am being ignored. Then I ask myself is it just paranoia and if so then things in my mind really are not good. One minute I am telling myself to just let it go and focus on myself and then I am wondering whether I should try to make contact again. If I get no response it will really hit me again. I would like one day to find peace with the brother who hurt me, that may never happen, but I have accepted that. I think my reaction to this brother has affected my relationship with the other. Perhaps he thinks I went to far bringing the police into it. He might wonder what kind of person does that to a family member. And those thoughts bring me back to feeling guilty. It took me 5 years to stop that feeling, I dont want those feelings again. This all might sound confusing and that is what I am afraid of. Should I make contact again, should I just get on with rebuilding my life and hope my negative thoughts go away eventually? Should I just wait and see what happens?

PTSD-2048, trying to heal myself or at least understand what's happening,"I'm new to beyond blue as I'm trying to heal myself or at least understand what's happening. I have been on anti depressants for about 5 weeks which I don't know if the are working and have seen a doctor who is setting up some therapy for me. My childhood was pretty good up until age 9 when my parents divorced due my mum cheating on my dad. I was molested 3 times, once when I was 4 by my grandfather, once when I was 9 by an adult female and once by my mothers boyfriend when I was 11. My mother then dated an alcoholic for 3 years which you can only imagine that. Then when I was 14 we had a house fire and lost everything, our car didn't work so a paddy wagon picked us up n took me to a welfare house. All my siblings went to other people. I stayed with my mother with not enough money to even wash our smoked out clothes..My mother lost everything and started saying aliens were coming to get her and could hear demons and would crawl into bed with me at night. She would also get me to do sayonces with her when I was about 13. I later realised she had paranoid scitzophrenia which remains untreated. I am now 36. My father after the divorce emotionally and financially abandoned me as was very hard as he was very present when my parents were married. through my young adult life used alcohol a lot and became very angry. But through it all I was still ok, bought my own house, held a good job and was quite strong .3 years ago I thought I met the love of my life.. He moved in..asked my father for my hand in marriage and dec 2014 took me home to New Zealand to meet his family. When we got there he changed, we were there for 4 weeks and all he wanted to do was drink n hang with mates which I understood as he hadn't seen them in 4 years but it was to much. I did a pregnancy test and found out I was over 5 weeks pregnant..upon going home I tried to talk about it and was faced with a cold wall..no emotion, no care.. He told me he didn't want me sitting around n getting all fat n stuff and basically left. I was forced to terminate my child of 7 weeks and left my job, my house, my life which I loved. During all this my family had to take me home...pull me out of bed.all hope was gone, severe anxiety attacks...not crying but wailing, my heart was beyond shattered, he came back n begged for forgivenes, told me he would make it right only to betray me again. He told me I was insecure, needy, depressing, a totally different man to who he was before going to New Zealand.",amwa,Community Member,09-09-2015,PTSD and trauma,1,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/trying-to-heal-myself-or-at-least-understand-what-s-happening/td-p/109384
PTSD-2049,Feeling more insignificant than ever,"Hi, I don't know where to start since I have so much to tell and I am nervous while I am typing this but I feel I need to reach out to someone since I feel I can't reach out to my partner, friends and family. I have always felt insignificant, worthless and alone or 'on the other side' since my car crash 14 years ago. The crash has left me with facial scarring and Acquired Brain Injury, which lead to short term memory loss. I have felt useless since I had limitations to the things I can do and even though I have gotten better at the limitations, I never seem to get over the fact that I cannot be where I was before the crash. This lead to me disliking myself and angry with myself and my life During rehab all I wanted to do was to get better so I can live my life as normal as I possibly can. Part of that was getting a job, like everyone else. I came close to that goal and at that same moment I thought I had a better grasp of the feelings and thoughts that were in me but since my current relationship, everything seems to be 'spilling'. I have been actively applying for jobs so I can achieve this goal but have been unlucky lately. Whenever I try to bring it up to my partner, of the feelings of disappointment and powerlessness that I cannot support us more, financially, all he says was ""at least your day was better than mine"" or ""at least you are not stressed about work"" or since he suspects he has a hemorrhoid, ""at least you are not stressed about work and have a hemorrhoid"". Which has left me feeling so insignificant, I have been thinking about the situation all night and do not know what to do. I don't know if I should have the right to feel the way I do, feel kind of lost?

PTSD-2050,I feel a need to share my sexual assault story (trigger warning),"Hey I feel a need to share my story and maybe see how others feel about it and if my thinking is faulty, I don't want pity. The starting of the trauma that put the dent in my armor and shattered my self confidence. It's been 20 years now of the initial sexual assault that was done to me when i was 5 maybe even when i was 4 i'm not quite sure. No one will really give me the specifics. I'm the youngest of 3. Brother is disabled by epilepsy. Eldest sister has admitted that she deliberately put me in harms way to protect herself when her survival instinct overrode her maternal instinct of protect the young. It all went down when I was 5, my sister at 8yrs old told my mum why she didn't want to go visit dad (them being divorced) Our entire family on both sides turned on us or ignored our situation. They accused my sister of lying and of mum putting her up to it. So after it went to court and dad went to jail we had to move. We weren't able to go see any shrinks. For years we moved around, going from town to town which further screwed our education of having to go from school to school. We actually settled in an area for 5 years but it was during those five years that I was again sexually assaulted but this time by mum's boyfriend. I didn't speak up, we were going through enough trouble at that time and I didn't want to add to it. The years of moving, making no friends and having my own sister pick on me and break my trust when I tried to do the usual thing of ""run to the big sister to tell her everything"" and then that last sexual assault finally broke my armor, shattered my self confidence and esteem. It seems it destroyed something inside me, I can't place what it is that's broken. Its been 20 years as i said before, 14yrs of having no father figure. I reunited with my dad 6 or 7 years ago. My thinking is that I was too young to remember it, he did his time in jail, he admitted to the court what he did and now has to live with the guilt and grief he brought on himself for what he did. I don't deny that there is trauma I just can't remember it, consciously at least. My sister hates me because I'm living with him now and my mum was actually proud of me for the first time... I feel uncertain about something but I can't quite put my finger on it. Dad hasn't done or said anything about it, all he's done is apologize while he cried for putting me through it.",Raven666,Community Member,25-08-2015,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/i-feel-a-need-to-share-my-sexual-assault-story-trigger-warning/td-p/177605
PTSD-2051,Verbally abusive husband or am I just losing my mind?,"My husband &I both have been married before & I have 2 sons who lives with their dad in South Africa & my husband has 4 daughters16-25. We have known each other for more than 15 years. The 25y old has a mental disability & lives with us along with the 16y old. His children constantly causes issues but so does he. I have been told they are not my children & am not allowed to talk to them about anything yet I get told I should get off my high throne & make a better effort to build better relationships with them. I feel like when I do that, he'll always causes some issue & manipulate them to choose his side & hate me again. In 3years we have not had one week of peace. I have been going for counseling at a counselor as well as my local pastor. He has been to my pastor for a while but stopped, says there is nothing wrong with him it's me that has the problem. The few times he did go to my pastor he told them lies & managed to manipulate the situation so to turn it into his favor. Until last year October I still believed I was the problem & that I needed help. Last year October things got so bad again that I tried to commit suicide for the second time. After that failed, I sought out some help from a counselor who helped me to think differently of myself. However things still has not changed in our house! Every week there will be something new he will find to start an argument with me and nothing I do or say is ever right. He would yell at me that I am f'd up, that no one will ever love me, I am a hateful person & he hates people like that. He says I just hate him & his daughters & had a calculated plan to ruin their lives. He will tell me he wants a divorce but he is not going to get it, I should. If I use the car he says I am just using him & I steal his car as I do not pay for it. I am a housewife so I do not earn any money! He will tell me I sit on my back all day, thinking out all kinds of devious plans against him. I used to yell & swear back at him to give him some of his own medicine but I stopped doing that now as that just gave him more excuse to point fingers at me. I then just leave him alone and keep to myself. Eventually after a day or two he'll just give me hugs and act as if nothing ever happened! No apologies whatsoever! After he has managed to push his children away from me again and pushed me away, he comes back in being the hero who loves me and wants to comfort me!Am I losing my mind or is there something seriously wrond with my husband? beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

PTSD-2052,Ptsd,Hi Last year my husband was diagnosed with ptsd and began treatment with a psychologist. At this point in time we had only been married for 6 months. I only ever knew he suffered depression from a back injury. i have seen little progress in his ability to manage his ptsd compared to that of late last year. I am now concerned he is no longer attending his appointments as he appears very withdrawn and shows little interest in my day/life or our marriage. I am sorry if this sounds selfish. It is not my intention. Do you have any suggestions on how I can manage withdrawal. If I try speaking with him I am accused of being a nag or starting a fight?? He also has a alcohol addiction. Our weekends or potential time together is generally based around his hangover and depression. He suffers social anxiety whereby he only maintains friends he has known for a long time or those he can make while drinking. Is there a way I can help him to manage this in order for him to feel less anxious?,Ana3,Community Member,23-04-2014,PTSD and trauma,3,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/ptsd/td-p/72038
PTSD-2053,Trauma to apathy,"I was recently involved in a traumatic situation where one of my best friends was left brutally injured. I helped rescue him from the situation that left him in this position and was involved in the transporting of him to the hospital. Im glad to report that he made it through the experience and is making a miraculous recovery. I have been feeling really up and down since the event; feelings of regret and guilt for not doing more than I did on the day even though I don't know what else that could have been. People constantly ask me if I am ok, and I respond that I am, but I know that I'm not. I just don't want the fuss. I feel stuck in what i am doing day to day, even though it's new and should be exciting. I think I'm hiding my anguish perfectly and that's probably the most unhealthy thing to do. I work hard to pay back the debt I'm in and know that 'that's life' but get a sinking realisation that 'that's life'. I over think everything and this leads to procrastination and poor productivity at work which stresses me out that I'm not doing a good enough job. I feel guilty and selfish that this post will take up the time of others that need more help than I do. I constantly talk about wanting to help others but do nothing to implement any idea I might have. Lastly and most embarrassingly I cry sometimes feeling sorry for myself, and then feel stupid because there's people way worse off than I am.

PTSD-2054,"I need strength to leave my abusive, controlling boyfriend","On the outside everyone thinks we are the perfect couple. Both young (21), blonde, outgoing, ambitious, passionate. Behind closed doors, I can't do anything right. My boyfriend and I both have depression. He is addicted to weed. This makes him veeeery paranoid. He goes through my phone to check who I'm texting. He texts me 10 times a day to find out what I'm doing. He tells me who I'm allowed to see, and when I'm allowed to see them. He calls me names . He's hit me before. He said he never would again but... I can't believe him. He owes me over $1000. He doesn't let me sleep at night unless he is tired, and I am forced to wake up when he does. He forced me to move into his parents house, knowing I despise them. I now dread coming home every day, because in an argument they said to my face I wasn't welcome there. He says if I move out, he will never speak to me again. I've always been the strong, confident, smiling girl who was surrounded by friends at all times. I was known for my smile!!! Now, I don't even know my smile. I met him when I started living in a new country. Due to his controlling behaviour, I haven't made many friends here. Now, I know I need to leave and get my life back. I feel like I'm wasting the best years of my life with someone who brings more tears than smiles. When he is in a good mood he is perfect, but it's just there isn't any good moods anymore. I am sick of being bullied, and I want my confidence back! I just want to be me again.Once October comes, I am definitely leaving Australia. I am only worried about how I get through the months before then...

PTSD-2055,Trying to deal with the aftermath of appearing at the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse in Institutions.,"Hi, I am new to this and really don't know what I am doing, however I need to do something positive to get some help. I am having Counselling once a week over the phone but it isn't helping at the moment. In Feb 2014 I testified at the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse in Institutions. Since then it has been a never ending ordeal with Solicitors, Police, Doctors and Counsellors, each one rehashing my story over and over again, all wanting the nitty gritty details. I was told that I wouldn't be in the papers or on TV unless I gave permission, I didn't give permission but there I was all over the TV and in the papers, I was mortified. In 1969 -1970 I was institutionalised in a state run home in NSW for running away from home, it was there that I was, physically, verbally and sexually assaulted. I kept my secret for 46 years, but decided to speak out in the hope that what happened to me would never happen to another child in care. i am depressed not only because of the flashbacks and the ordeal of testifying but also because the Government does not seem to take heed and take the Royal Commission seriously. Unfortunately theses types of abuses are still happening, nothing is being done and I feel that I have dredged up my past and come forward to no avail. My friends shun me because they do not know what to say to me and my family thinks I am such strong person that I have it all under control. I am falling apart at the seems but still trying to put on a brave face, behind the scenes I am a mess.

PTSD-2057,Letting go after an abusive relationship,"Hi everyone, I joined this forum because I need someone to talk to. About six months ago I left an abusive relationship after two years together. My ex-boyfriend was extremely controlling and didn't like me leaving the house without him. I ended up giving up a lot of my friends and social activities because I didn't like fighting every single time I wanted to go somewhere without him. It got to the point where the only time I did anything on my own was when I went to my weekly orchestra rehearsal and that still wasn't enough for him, he wanted to come to that as well. When I refused we would have huge fights and he would make ridiculous statements like ""Of course I would be happy if you did everything with me and I never saw my friends without you there"". Of course, when I actually wanted to come along to something with his friends, he would make excuses about why I couldn't. I had the opportunity to go to a weekend retreat organised by my work, and was really looking forward to getting to know some of my workmates better. When I told him about it he wanted to come, and I explained it was only for work people, and that many of my married colleagues would be there without their partners. He then told me I had enough friends so didn't need to go, and when I held firm and said I was going to go, he tried to make me promise not to drink alcohol. When I refused to promise this (I am a social drinker, whereas he would drink to the point of being drunk every single day), he got angry. I did go, but I spent the entire weekend crying and on the phone to him trying to convince him I wasn't cheating on him. I shared very intimate details about my past with him, including the fact that (while single) I once picked up a guy in a bar and had sex with him and how afterwards I hated myself for years for doing it. Instead of being understanding, he used this information against me as a reason not to trust me because ""I'd done it before"". Finally, there was one time when I said I would have sex with him. He spent the morning saying nasty things and making me feel bad about myself, so I told him I didn't want to have sex at that time because I was miserable. He got angry and started shouting about how I never want to have sex with him. Eventually I got sick of it and took my pants off and said ""Do whatever you want"". I was crying and thought it would make him realise how ridiculous he was being. Instead he started having sex with me, ignoring my sobbing and the fact that I was obviously in pain. None of these incidents was enough to make me leave him. I was embarrassed because I thought it would mean I was a failure at relationships. I didn't want to tell anyone because I didn't think they would believe me - he was always charming in group situations and the fact that he didn't like me doing anything alone meant I didn't have any of my own friends to talk to. Because of the isolation, he could usually twist anything around so that it was my fault completely (mostly due to my depression) and I believed him. Eventually I did end it and I am certain that it was the right thing to do. I immediately felt a huge sense of relief and have not even thought about getting back with him. I'm slowly coming to realise that I am able to drive and I'm not as fat as he said I was, and my world does not fall apart without him. The problem is that, even though I am happier on my own, I can't help dwelling on the relationship. I'm angry at him for treating me like this and I'm angry at myself for not leaving earlier. Every day I think about how bad it was and it makes me miserable, like I'm reliving it. I just can't seem to stop thinking about it or let it go. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and am taking medication and seeing a counsellor, all of which are helping, but I'm still really struggling.",weatherboard,Community Member,04-07-2013,PTSD and trauma,13,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/letting-go-after-an-abusive-relationship/td-p/68696
PTSD-2058,"HELP Advice needed, my childhood sexual abuse is ruining my marriage","Sorry ppl if it's so long, when I was 15 my father forced me to chat to my 1st cousin, who I did not find attraction to at all. He was 11 yrs older than me and by 16 yrsold I was married overseas to my cousin and only my grandmother and 6yr old sister were with me so I had no say in the matter cause my father said to me' you have to marry him cause we can't tell every guy asking for your hand about what happen to you. But apparently my father told my cousin what happen and he still wanted to marry me. I never wanted it from the beginning and told my cousin that but I was scared and shy, then he started crying and begging me to marry him and I just kept remembering my father.Then when he arrived to Australia I told him again and my father no one would listen.

PTSD-2060,Violent Ex/My sons father is Released from jail,"I had a very tough domestic violence situation last year and was threatened with death threats and a break an enter when i was 11 weeks pregnant. My ex (residing in aus) was deported back to his birth country. Now, being pregnant with all my hormones I decided I could forgive him when I was 16 weeks pregnant. Silly me. He ends up in jail when I was 28 weeks pregnant. And now my son is 5 months old and his dad is being released a few weeks. On the plus side, it is unlikely he's able to return but his father (babys grandad) resides in aus so the likelihood of abduction is also very high. My problem is I've been very civil, sending photos to his mother and keeping the peace as know this is favored in a court setting. He wants me to go to his country with my son so they can meet. I think you can see my concern as to why I dont want to. Should I literally just cut off contact with them all or stand my ground? I have extreme anxiety and OCD thoughts so you can see why I'm having a time letting this go. He's on the birth cert becaise they managed to track him down and I didn't want my child growing up thinking he was fatherless. I've been far too nice and lenient so how can I turn this around?",BelleAnthony2014,Community Member,31-01-2015,PTSD and trauma,2,/t5/ptsd-and-trauma/violent-ex-my-sons-father-is-released-from-jail/td-p/60345
