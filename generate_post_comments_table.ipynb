I think about how bad I feel every day and I just want these feelings to go away. I dont know where to go from here. I feel like I just exist with no purpose what so ever. I have lost the will and motivation for life and have completely lost myself in the process and it scares me that I will never feel happy again. I just feel empty inside. I go to work as a distraction and try to fill up my weekend with things to do, but I dont get any enjoyment out of it. I feel like I have hit rock bottom and I am trying to get out of it, but I dont know where to go from here. I feel so alone, even though I have good friends, I just don't feel they understand. I feel guilty because my family know that I am not being myself but I dont know how to find myself again. I am on anti-depressants and am seeing a psychologist, but I feel like its not enough atm....I am so lost\n"
